### [1] [Characterizing Topological Phase Transition in Non-Hermitian Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08316)
*ZhaoXiang Fang,Yongxu Fu,Guang-Can Guo,Long Xiong*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new concept, Topological Distance (TD), to analyze topological phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems, demonstrating its effectiveness across various dimensions and conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in non-Hermitian systems has sparked a need for new tools to study their topological properties and phase transitions.

Method: They propose using TD, a measure based on trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, to evaluate dissimilarities between eigenstates and identify phase boundaries.

Result: The TD and its derivatives reveal phase transitions, and the method is generally applicable to 1D, higher-order, and non-Hermitian systems under different boundary conditions.

Conclusion: TD offers a new approach to characterize non-Hermitian topology, showing promise for broad applications in topological physics.

Abstract: We propose and present a concept of Topological Distance (TD), obtained from
the integration of trace distance over the generalized Brillouin zone, in order
to characterize the topological transitions of non-Hermitian systems.
Specifically, such a quantity is used to measure the overall dissimilarity
between eigen wavefunctions upon traversing all possible matter states, and
confirms the phase boundaries through observing the divergences of both TD and
its partial derivatives; we clarify its origin and also offer a theoretical
explanation. The method is developed to characterize the non-Hermitian topology
in a novel way, and shows its generality and effectiveness in 1D non-Hermitian
Kitaev systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians under periodic or open boundary
conditions, and even generalizable to higher-order topological systems,
providing a novel perspective to understand topological physics.

### [2] [Flux Response of Rotation-Invariant Topological Insulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08357)
*Yechen Xun,Rui-Xing Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 通过在三维$b{Z}_2$拓扑绝缘体中穿入磁通量，可以产生束缚态，揭示基态内蕴特性。这里研究发现，旋转对称性导致分类提升，揭示了新的拓扑效应。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究磁通引导的束缚态，揭示ing topological phases and their implications。

Method: 用了拓扑相分类和群论分析的方法，研究系统在不同对称性下的表现。

Result: 3D 磁性能提升分类维度，出现两种不同 Majorana 模式。

Conclusion: 通过穿入磁通的纳米线，可以实现代数 Majorana 状态。

Abstract: Threading magnetic flux into topological phases can induce bound states that
reveal intrinsic properties of the ground state. In a 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological insulator, a quantized $\pi$ flux traps a pair of 1D helical modes,
whereas a trivial insulator hosts none. In this work, we show that in the
presence of even-fold rotation symmetry $C_n$, a 3D band insulator features a
refined $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of the flux response.
Specifically, it can host two distinct types of helical flux-bound modes that
are distinguished by their angular momentum. When both types of flux modes
coexist, the system is not a strong topological insulator, but a
$C_n$-protected topological crystalline insulator. Building on this result, we
propose that flux-threaded nanowires of such topological phase provide a
natural platform for realizing 1D crystalline topological superconductors with
multiple $C_n$-protected Majorana modes.

### [3] [Proximity superconductivity in chiral kagome antiferromagnets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08372)
*Adam Yanis Chaou,Gal Lemut,Felix von Oppen,Piet W. Brouwer*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Recent experiments on Mn3Ge show proximity-induced spin-polarized superconductivity, and a minimal model with chemical potential and spin canting displays rich phases. The model predicts a superconducting phase transitioning to Chern insulator and then to topological superconducting phases with specific Chern numbers, suggesting applications in spintronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of superconductivity in kagome antiferromagnets is crucial due to their unique spin textures and potential for exotic superconducting states. The paper presents an experimental confirmation followed by theoretical modeling to predict various phases, contributing to the broader understanding of spinful superconductors in frustrated systems.

Method: The authors likely used a combination of experimental and theoretical methods. Experiments involved proximity-induced superconductivity in Mn3Ge, utilizing advanced techniques like angle-resolved magnetoresistance or specific doping conditions. Theoretically, a minimal model incorporating spin canting and chemical potential was constructed, possibly using mean-field theory or exact diagonalization to calculate phase diagrams and identify quantum phases such as Chern insulators and topological superconductors.

Result: The experiments on Mn3Ge suggest the existence of spin-polarized superconductivity, while the theoretical model predicts a phase diagram with distinct topological phases characterized by specific Chern numbers. These findings open new avenues for exploring exotic superconducting states tied to spin textures in frustrated magnets and could underpin advanced spintronic devices.

Conclusion: This study bridges experiment and theory, demonstrating that proximity-induced superconductivity in chiral kagome antiferromagnets can lead to topological phases with tunable Chern numbers. The results imply spintronic applications and further research into exotic superconductivity in frustrated magnetic systems. Future work should focus on confirming the predicted phases experimentally and exploring device applications in spintronics.

Abstract: Recent experiments on the chiral kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Ge have
provided strong evidence of proximity-induced spin-polarized superconductivity.
We introduce and explore a minimal model which exhibits a rich phase diagram as
a function of chemical potential and spin canting. We find a valley-singlet
superconducting phase for chemical potentials and canting consistent with the
experimental system. This phase transitions into a Chern insulator at larger
canting and gives way to topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers
${\cal C}_{\rm BdG} = \pm 1, \pm 3$ at other chemical potentials. Our results
show that proximity-induced superconductivity in kagome antiferromagnets is a
promising route towards exotic superconductivity with spin-polarized Cooper
pairs, with potential applications in spintronics.

### [4] [Spin-orbit-enabled realization of arbitrary two-qubit gates on moving spins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08394)
*D. Fernández-Fernández,Y. Matsumoto,L. M. K. Vandersypen,G. Platero,S. Bosco*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The research introduces a method using spin qubits in semiconductor double quantum dots to create arbitrary two-qubit gates with high fidelity by leveraging strong spin-orbit interaction and controlling shuttling speed and waiting times, offering a potentially simpler approach compared to static dot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance quantum computing by demonstrating a new method for implementing two-qubit gates with high fidelity, reducing control complexity in scalable systems.

Method: The method involves using spin qubits in double quantum dots that are moved using gate voltages, utilizing strong spin-orbit interaction to perform arbitrary two-qubit gates by controlling speed and waiting times.

Result: The researchers successfully implement arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit gates, which often require multiple steps with static dots, achieving this in a single step through spin shuttling.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for scalable and efficient two-qubit gate implementation in quantum computing architectures through spin shuttling utilizing strong spin-orbit interaction.

Abstract: Shuttling spin qubits in systems with large spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can
cause errors during motion. However, in this work, we demonstrate that SOI can
be harnessed to implement an arbitrary high-fidelity two-qubit (2Q) gate. We
consider two spin qubits defined in a semiconductor double quantum dot that are
smoothly moved toward each other by gate voltages. We show that an arbitrary
high-fidelity 2Q gate can be realized by controlling the shuttling speed and
waiting times, and leveraging strong intrinsic or extrinsic SOI. Crucially,
performing 2Q operations during qubit transport enables a one-step realization
of a wide range of 2Q gates, which often involve several steps when implemented
using static dots. Our findings establish a practical route toward direct
implementation of any 2Q gate via spin shuttling, significantly reducing
control overhead in scalable quantum computing architectures.

### [5] [Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461)

Method: 该研究通过分析Cayley图构造了新的晶格结构，结合群作用和规范场理论，推导了系统的一体和规范特性，采用群论和拓扑学方法构建模型。

Result: 研究表明，Cayley晶格的规范场类型及其环路配置由覆盖子群的不可约表示决定，能够模拟多电荷粒子的规范场系统，并通过定理为任意阿贝尔规范群提供了构造方法。

Conclusion: Cayley晶格为在任意规范群下构建合成晶格系统提供了新方法，具有在量子体系和合成材料中的重要应用价值。

Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri
Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of synthetic lattices whose
Hamiltonians are symmetric under the simply transitive action of a generic
discrete group G. We show that these systems naturally realize the
generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary
discrete gauge groups. The one-body dynamics mimics that of a particle carrying
multiple charges, each experiencing a distinct static gauge-field
configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the
irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup C of G, while the
Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the
embedding of C in G. We analyze in depth the role of other subgroups in shaping
both the lattice geometry and the dynamics. For engineering relevance, we
discuss a theorem that constructs all Cayley-crystals for a given abelian gauge
group, and we provide two-dimensional examples corresponding to crystals
threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Moreover, Cayley-crystals can be
realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can
fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual
exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了平方结构晶体中-CSL的形成机制及磁电特性，有助于开发自旋电场控制的三度定向器件。

Abstract: Chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) are anharmonic magnetic structures typically
found in uniaxial chiral magnets. In this study, we report the observation of
CSL in bulk Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, a chiral insulator known for its magnetoelectric
properties. Using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments, we
demonstrate the formation of CSLs in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ at low temperatures, driven
by the competition between cubic anisotropy and magnetic field. Our
observations of higher harmonics in the SANS signal clearly indicate the
anharmonic nature of the spiral. This finding underscores the complex interplay
between magnetic interactions in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, offering insights for
potential applications of CSLs in electric-field controlled spintronic devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Strained-layer magnetism in epitaxial graphene heterostructures offers a pathway for next-generation spintronic devices with tunable properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract discusses the synthesis and characterization of a heterostructure involving epitaxial graphene and Eu-based magnetic atoms. The key motivation seems to be exploring innovative ways to induce magnetism in graphene, which has potential applications in spintronics, as indicated by the study's focus and concluding statements.

Method: The researchers likely used epitaxial graphene as the base, incorporating Eu elements to create a regular lattice of magnetic atoms. They then performed various measurements such as magnetization, magnetoresistance, Hall effect, and resistivity to analyze the material's magnetic properties and functionality for spintronic applications.

Result: The study found that the heterostructure exhibits easy-plane 2D magnetism with a high Tc, negative magnetoresistance, and an anomalous Hall effect. Additionally, quantum oscillations in resistivity highlighted the presence of low-mass carriers.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the development of 2D magnets from epitaxial graphene, presenting a promising material for future spintronic devices that can be tailored with magnetic properties.

Abstract: Imprinting magnetism into graphene makes an important step to its
applications in spintronics. An actively explored approach is proximity
coupling of graphene to a 2D magnet. In these endeavors, the use of epitaxial
graphene may bring significant advantages due to its superiority over the
exfoliated counterpart and natural integration with the substrate but the
problem of attaining magnetism persists. Here, we report synthesis and analysis
of a heterostructure coupling epitaxial graphene with a regular lattice of
magnetic atoms formed by Eu intercalation. The magnetization measurements
reveal easy-plane 2D magnetism in the material, with the transition temperature
controlled by low magnetic fields. The emerging negative magnetoresistance and
anomalous Hall effect point at spin polarization of the carriers in graphene.
In the paramagnetic phase, the magnetoresistance in graphene exhibits critical
exponential behavior of the induced magnetic state. The intercalation does not
compromise the parental electronic structure - quantum oscillations in the
resistivity manifest low-mass carriers in graphene. The results are set against
those for an isostructural material based on intercalated nonmagnetic Sr.
Overall, the study expands the family of 2D magnets and establishes a
prospective material for graphene-based spintronics.

### [8] [Probing imbalanced Weyl nodes in two-dimensional anisotropic Weyl semimetal via optical conductivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09011)
*Suheel Ahmad Malik,M. A. H. Ahshan,SK Firoz Islam*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: 研究了二维非等轴半金属的能带结构和光学性质，发现倾斜方向不同导致节点能量不平衡，并通过分别用光致动量和导电实验验证，发现倾斜影响电子迁移路径，影响 bulk conductance;此外，通过周期驱动打开拓扑能隙，但半金属态无法转化为 Chern 拦位相，而是通过光致动量可以探测到变化。

Method: 利用半经典玻尔兹曼输运理论分析光学导电性，研究周期性驱动力下系统能隙变化与拓扑性质转换。

Result: 发现倾斜方向影响节点能量不平衡，通过光致动量和导电实验验证此现象。此外，倾斜使半德雷克材料从半金属态转换为金属态，并通过周期驱动力下开能隙，但半金属态无法转为Chern相。

Conclusion: 提出了二维非等轴半金属中各向异性节点能量不平衡的现象及其光学响应途径，为开发新型态材料提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic band structure and
optical properties of a two-dimensional anisotropic semimetal that is described
by a tilted semi-Dirac type spectrum with a pair of Weyl nodes. We observe that
a tilt along the quadratic direction can give rise to an energy imbalance
between these nodes, contrary to the effect of tilt along the linear direction.
We investigate the optical response of such system subjected to an external AC
bias, aiming to probe the energy imbalance between the nodes. We show that the
anisotropic interband optical conductivity gives a clear signature of
imbalanced nodes by exciting electrons at two different chemical potentials at
near zero frequency indicating, and the difference between these two chemical
potentials is the direct measure of the energy imbalance. Subsequently, we also
investigate the intraband DC conductivity by using the semi-classical Boltzmann
transport theory which reveals that contrary to the tilted Dirac materials,
tilt can convert semi-Dirac material from semimetallic phase to metallic phase.
Furthermore, we periodically drive the system by external time-periodic
perturbation to open up topological gap at those nodes. We also show that the
presence of imbalanced Weyl nodes would prevent the SD material from switching
to Chern topological phase even after opening topological gaps at the nodes as
the bulk remains gapless. Such state cannot be probed by the usual anomalous
Hall response as it will be overshadowed by the bulk contribution. Here, we
show that those gaps at different chemical potential can be probed by optical
excitation.

*Km Rubi,Kun Han,Huang Zhen,Michel Goiran,Duncan K. Maude,Walter Escoffier,A. Ariando*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum oscillations observed in a specific oxide material interface at low magnetic fields, which persist even at low temperatures. These oscillations are attributed to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, and the results suggest potential applications in quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum oscillations in magnetic materials is crucial for advancements in quantum computing, precision sensors, and device concepts.

Method: The research likely involved synthesizing a heterostructure material and applying magnetic field measurements at cryogenic temperatures to observe the oscillations. They probably used electrostatic gating to control carrier density and vary the magnetic field. Analysis would include temperature and field dependence of the oscillation parameters.

Result: The study found persistent B-periodic quantum oscillations at low fields (below 7 T) with a phase coherence length longer than 1 micrometer at 0.1 K. These oscillations decay exponentially with both temperature and magnetic field. Increasing carrier density through gating reduces oscillation amplitude and frequency, eventually suppressing them.

Conclusion: The presence of these oscillations under varying conditions suggests the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect and opens up new avenues for quantum interference studies and device applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We report quantum oscillations in magnetoresistance that are periodic in
magnetic field ($B$), observed at the interface between
(La$_{0.3}$Sr$_{0.7}$)(Al$_{0.65}$Ta$_{0.35}$)O$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$. Unlike
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, which appear at magnetic fields $ > 7$ T and
diminish quickly as the temperature rises, these $B$-periodic oscillations
emerge at low fields and persist up to 10 K. Their amplitude decays
exponentially with both temperature and field, specifying dephasing of quantum
interference. Increasing the carrier density through electrostatic gating
results in a systematic reduction in both the amplitude and frequency of the
oscillations, with complete suppression beyond a certain gate voltage. We
attribute these oscillations to the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak effect, likely
arising from naturally formed closed-loop paths due to the interconnected
quasi-one-dimensional conduction channels along SrTiO$_3$ domain walls. The
relatively long phase coherence length ($\sim$ 1.8 $\mu$m at 0.1 K), estimated
from the oscillation amplitude, highlights the potential of complex oxide
interfaces as a promising platform for exploring quantum interference effects
and advancing device concepts in quantum technologies, such as mesoscopic
interferometers and quantum sensors.

*Fabian Hader,Fabian Fuchs,Sarah Fleitmann,Karin Havemann,Benedikt Scherer,Jan Vogelbruch,Lotte Geck,Stefan van Waasen*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper proposes automated qubit tuning methods using edge detection in charge stability diagrams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in semiconductor quantum dots is optimizing qubit performance by controlling the number of electrons. Traditional methods are labor-intensive, so the paper aims to develop automated solutions.

Method: The study evaluates edge detection techniques using simulated data from SimCATS, then tests the optimized methods on actual GaAs and SiGe qubit samples.

Result: The optimized approaches show better precision, fewer missed edges, and stable classification on real data.

Conclusion: Automated edge detection can significantly improve qubit tuning, potentially integrate with quantum hardware.

Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots require an appropriate number of
electrons to function as qubits. The number of electrons is usually tuned by
analyzing charge stability diagrams, in which charge transitions manifest as
edges. Therefore, to fully automate qubit tuning, it is necessary to recognize
these edges automatically and reliably. This paper investigates possible
detection methods, describes their training with simulated data from the
SimCATS framework, and performs a quantitative comparison with a future
hardware implementation in mind. Furthermore, we investigated the quality of
the optimized approaches on experimentally measured data from a GaAs and a SiGe
qubit sample.

*Zeyu Hao,A. M. Zimmerman,Kenji Watanabe,Takashi Taniguchi,Philip Kim*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores Coulomb-drag measurements in a heterostructure using bilayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, showing ECs under specific conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electron interactions in 2D materials, which is crucial for quantum computing and devices.

Method: Experiments with bilayer graphene stacked with hexagonal boron nitride, using gates and bias to control electron layers.

Result: Observed ECs and fractional QH states when both layers are in N=0 and N=1 orbitals, respectively.

Conclusion: ECs exist beyond the monolayer state, offering new insights for future electronic applications.

Abstract: We present Coulomb-drag measurements on a heterostructure comprising two
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by a 2.5 nm hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) spacer in the quantum Hall (QH) regime. Using top and
bottom gate control, together with an interlayer bias, we independently tune
the two BLG layers into either the lowest (N = 0) or second (N = 1) Landau
level (LL) orbital and probe their interlayer QH states. When both layers
occupy the N = 0 orbital, we observe both interlayer exciton condensates (ECs)
at integer total filling and interlayer fractional QH states, echoing the
results in double monolayer graphene. In contrast to previous studies, however,
when both BLG layers occupy the N = 1 orbital, we also observe quantized drag
signals, signifying an interlayer exciton condensate formed between the second
LLs. By tuning the layer degree of freedom, we find that this N = 1 EC state
arises only when the N = 1 wavefunction in each BLG is polarized toward the hBN
interface to maximize the interlayer Coulomb interaction.

### [12] [Discovery of 10,059 new three-dimensional periodic orbits of general three-body problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08568)
*Xiaoming Li,Shijun Liao*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: Discovering numerous 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem, especially ones that change with varying mass ratios, contributing to understanding chaos.ENABLE Birds and IDFA scaled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the three-body problem's periodic orbits could aid in understanding chaotic systems.

Method: High-accuracy numerical methods analyzed orbits for various mass ratios.

Result: 10,059 3D orbits, 20% stable; in equal mass, 21 'choerographical' orbits; 273 'piano-trio' orbits.

Conclusion: Novel orbits aid understanding the chaotic nature of the three-body problem.

Abstract: A very few three-dimensional (3D) periodic orbits of general three-body
problem (with three finite masses) have been discovered since Newton mentioned
it in 1680s. Using a high-accuracy numerical strategy we discovered 10,059
three-dimensional periodic orbits of the three-body problem in the cases of
$m_{1}=m_{2}=1$ and $m_{3}=0.1n$ where $1\leq n\leq 20$ is an integer, among
which 1,996 (about 20\%) are linearly stable. Note that our approach is valid
for arbitrary mass $m_{3}$ so that in theory we can gain an arbitrarily large
amount of 3D periodic orbits of the three-body problem. In the case of three
equal masses, we discovered twenty-one 3D ``choerographical'' periodic orbits
whose three bodies move periodically in a single closed orbit. It is very
interesting that, in the case of two equal masses, we discovered 273
three-dimensional periodic orbits with the two bodies ($m_{1}=m_{2}=1$) moving
along a single closed orbit and the third ($m_{3}\neq 1$) along a different
one: we name them ``piano-trio'' orbits, like a trio for two violins and one
piano. To the best of our knowledge, all of these 3D periodic orbits have never
been reported, indicating the novelty of this work. The large amount of these
new 3D periodic orbits are helpful for us to have better understandings about
chaotic properties of the famous three-body problem, which ``are, so to say,
the only opening through which we can try to penetrate in a place which, up to
now, was supposed to be inaccessible'', as pointed out by Poincar\'e, the
founder of chaos theory.

Abstract: The real-time prediction of chaotic systems requires a nonlinear-reduced
order model (ROM) to forecast the dynamics, and a stream of data from sensors
to update the ROM. Data-driven ROMs are typically built with a two-step
strategy: data compression in a lower-dimensional latent space, and prediction
of the temporal dynamics on it. To achieve real-time prediction, however, there
are two challenges to overcome: (i) ROMs of chaotic systems can become
numerically unstable; and (ii) sensors' data are sparse, i.e., partial, and
noisy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a three-step strategy: (i) a
convolutional autoencoder (CAE) compresses the system's state onto a
lower-dimensional latent space; (ii) a latent ROM (echo state network, ESN),
which is formulated as a state-space model, predicts the temporal evolution on
the latent space; and (iii) sequential data assimilation based on the Ensemble
Kalman filter (EnKF) adaptively corrects the latent ROM by assimilating noisy
and sparse measurements. This provides a numerically stable method
(DA-CAE-ESN), which corrects itself every time that data becomes available from
sensors. The DA-CAE-ESN is tested on spatio-temporally chaotic partial
differential equations: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a
two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation (Kolmogorov flow). We show that the
method provides accurate and stable forecasts across different levels of noise,
sparsity, and sampling rates. As a by-product, the DA-CAE-ESN acts as a
localization strategy that mitigates spurious correlations, which arise when
applying the EnKF to high-dimensional systems. The DA-CAE-ESN provides a
numerically stable method to perform real-time predictions, which opens
opportunities for deploying data-driven latent models.

Conclusion: 此次研究填补了液 scintillator 在高能非放射性离子响应方面的空白，为大液 scintillator 检测器的应用提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Liquid scintillator is widely used in particle physics experiments due to its
high light yield, good timing resolution, scalability and low cost. Certain
liquid scintillators exhibit pulse shape discrimination capabilities because of
difference in fluorescence timing properties induced by different particles.
Its fluoresence timing properties have been measured mostly for radioactive
decay sources at MeV energies. We present a novel measurement of fluorescence
time properties of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to high-energy
ions of hydrogen (Z = 1), helium (Z = 2) and Krypton at around 200-300 MeV/u
for the first time. We compared the results to those from radioactive sources
and observed a distinct $dE/dX$ dependence, regardless of the particle type.
These findings are essential for physics searches such as the diffuse supernova
neutrino background in large liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO, and are
also critical towards understanding the underlying scintillation timing
mechanism.

Abstract: Modern X-ray detector systems urgently require compact, efficient, and fast
data compression schemes to handle the transmission of big data from pixel
arrays, enabling frame rates in the MHz regime. In this work, a data
compression ASIC that implements a streaming fixed-length lossy compression
scheme is introduced and analyzed, proving the feasibility and benefits of
on-chip compression. The compression scheme utilizes a vector matrix product
logic, which performs a number of floating-point multiplications, additions,
and accumulations. The logic is verified, synthesized, and shown to fit in the
area resource available for the X-ray detector under study, which comprises 192
x 168 pixels each of 12-bit width, and having a total area of 20 mm x 20 mm,
about 2 mm x 20 mm of which are available for the digital logic. Several system
architectures, precisions, and compression ratios ranging from 100 to 250 were
analyzed to pave the way for on-chip fixed-length compression (e.g., principal
component analysis, singular value decomposition) and data reduction (e.g.,
azimuthal integration) for X-ray and electron detectors.

Result:  successful synthesis and spectroscopic analysis, enabling quantum sensing applications. 

Conclusion:  new methods provide key tools for future precision measurements with exotic nuclei.

Abstract: Molecules with heavy, radioactive nuclei promise extreme sensitivity to
fundamental nuclear and particle physics. However, these nuclei are available
in limited quantities, which challenges their use in precision measurements.
Here we demonstrate the gas-phase synthesis, cryogenic cooling, and
high-resolution laser spectroscopy of radium monohydroxide, monodeuteroxide,

tabletop apparatus by combining novel radioactive target production protocols,
optically driven chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas, and low-background
spectroscopic detection methods. The molecules are cooled in the lab frame,
creating conditions that are the same starting points as many current molecular
precision measurement and quantum information experiments. This approach is
readily applied to a wide range of species and establishes key capabilities for
molecular quantum sensing of exotic nuclei.

Conclusion: 研究结论为实现精确的相位测量提供了理论基础。

Abstract: An exact expression for the phase of an atomic interferometer located in a
non-inertial reference frame (platform) moving along an arbitrary trajectory
and with an orientation that changes arbitrarily over time is obtained. This
expression takes into account precisely gravitational, Coriolis, centrifugal,
and gravity-gradient forces, which arise during the rotation of the gravity
source at a permanent rate. To achieve this result, we utilized the equations
for the atomic density matrix in the Wigner representation. Starting from the
exact formula, we derived three new terms in the well-known limit of small
rotation angles and short interrogation time, which are attributed to the
rotation and translational motion of the platform.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a protocol to measure state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms using dipole-dipole interactions and optical tweezers, demonstrating spin-motion coupling and various atomic dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the interaction of Rydberg atoms, particularly focusing on their motion and state changes, which has implications for quantum systems and atomic physics research.

Method: The research uses a one-dimensional optical array with optical tweezers, combines readout of atomic states and positions, and employs van der Waals repulsion and macrodimer proximity to study atom interactions.

Result: Experiments show van der Waals repulsion and oscillatory dynamics near macrodimer states. A Stern-Gerlach-like experiment successfully splits the atom wavepacket into distinct trajectories, confirming spin-motion coupling.

Conclusion: This protocol offers a novel approach to study spin-dependent atomic motion and opens possibilities for quantum computing with Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of
Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables
simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a
one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two
atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and
measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing
the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we
attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a
Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair
states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two
macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion
coupling mediated by the interactions.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将微观计算用于宏观HHG分析的有效性，为研究开放壳分子的复杂动力学提供了新方法。边带特性在宏观层面得以确认，为实验提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We extend the existing framework of macroscopic HHG to combine it with
high-accuracy ab initio calculations for molecules as microscopic input. This
approach is applied to HHG spectra exhibiting Mollow sidebands, for open shell
molecules undergoing nonadiabatic dynamics. We demonstrate the details of the
method and analyze how the predicted features in the microscopic HHG response
unambiguously survive macroscopic response calculations, and furthermore they
exhibit a interesting angular pattern in the far-field. We calculate the
macroscopic harmonic spectrum by combining many single-molecule calculations at
different intensities, obtained in one case from time-dependent density
functional theory calculations for N+ 2 , in second case for one electron time
dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a 1D double well model potential. For both
cases one can observe that the resulting macroscopic spectra exhibit Mollow
sidebands of approximately the same intensity as the main harmonics, while
being radiated at wider angles, meaning they could be isolated more easily in
an experiment.

### [20] [Rigorous quantum calculations for atom-molecule chemical reactions in electric fields: from single to multiple partial wave regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08600)
*Timur V. Tscherbul,Roman V. Krems*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Efficient quantum calculations of cross sections for atom-molecule reactions in electric fields are presented, addressing computational challenges through an asymptotic frame transformation. Results show resonance effects for the LiF+H reaction and minimal field effects for F+HD. Basis set convergence is important for interpreting these effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a significant computational challenge in quantum chemical calculations for reactive scattering under external electric fields, specifically for atom-molecule reactions.

Method: They developed an efficient method by expanding the wavefunction in hyperspherical basis functions and accounted for electric field interactions using total angular momentum representation. They addressed computational challenges with an asymptotic frame transformation between hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in an external field.

Result: The method successfully calculates cross sections for two reactions, showing resonance effects in one and minimal field effects in the other. The importance of basis set convergence is highlighted, with reduced-basis results showing significant field effects that disappear with larger basis sets.

Conclusion: The method provides a robust framework for understanding quantum dynamics in electric fields, emphasizing the role of basis set convergence in analyzing external field effects on chemical reactions.

Abstract: We present an efficient method for rigorous quantum calculations of cross
sections for atom-molecule reactive scattering in the presence of a dc electric
field. The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete
set of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the
interactions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted
for in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational
challenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev. Lett.
$\mathbf{115}$, 023201 (2015)] is addressed by an efficient asymptotic frame
transformation between the hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in the
presence of an external field. Using accurate {\it ab initio} potential energy
surfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical
reactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$
$\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field
strength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical
reaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions
between reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the
F + HD $\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for
state-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our
calculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the
proper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics.
While reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant
effects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish
when the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased.

TL;DR: 这篇论文讨论了自旋-半整数系统的SSFP实验中的行为偏差，发现SSFP在存在自旋相互作用时会出现与FT不同的表现，尤其是在1H重 spin decoupling时，可能放大干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSFP是一种常用的核磁共振脉冲序列，但目前的研究主要集中在孤立的自旋-半整数系统上，如水。这篇论文扩展了对更复杂自旋相互作用的分析，特别是在有自旋-自旋耦合的情况下，发现了SSFP实验中的显著偏差。

Method: 实验和理论分析结合的方法，具体包括使用13C NMR SSFP实验记录不同条件下的数据，以及通过理论推导来验证分析结果。

Result: 13C SSFP响应在没有和有1H去耦的情况下，表现出与FT不同的行为；尤其是在大翻转角SSFP脉冲串中，干扰可能放大。

Conclusion: SSFP实验在有自旋-自旋耦合的情况下的行为与FT不同，特别是在有1H去耦的情况下，可能出现较大的干扰，对实验结果的定量分析产生影响。

Abstract: Fourier Transform (FT) has been a mainstay of analytical 13C and 15N NMR. On
the other hand it has been shown that Steady State Free Precession (SSFP)
experiments which depart from this scheme can, under certain conditions, endow
13C and 15N small molecule NMR with comparable sensitivity and resolution. SSFP
is one of the earliest and most widely used NMR pulse sequences, yet its
analyses have focused on isolated spin-half ensembles such as water. The
present study demonstrates that significant deviations from such isolated
spin-half behavior may occur when SSFP is applied in the presence of spin-spin
couplings. Even in the simplest case supporting such couplings, a single 13C J
coupled to a 1H, departures from the isolated spin-half behavior arise in the
13C SSFP response, both in the absence and in the presence of 1H spin
decoupling. In the former case deviations are produced by the differential
relaxation of antiphase two-spin terms generated by the pulse train; in the
latter case, magnified interferences may arise between the SSFP pulses and the
coherent perturbation arising upon 1H decoupling. Although both phenomena are
also known in FT NMR, the spectral distortions that they will originate may be
much larger in the SSFP case, particularly if interpulse delays in large flip
angle SSFP pulse trains resonate with the coupling perturbations. The origins
of these effects are here analyzed for heteronuclear spin-half systems and
corroborated with 13C NMR SSFP experiments recorded under different conditions.
Additional considerations aimed at magnifying or suppressing these effects, as
well as extensions to more complex scenarios, are also briefly discussed.

Abstract: The on-demand manipulation of triplet states in closed-shell single molecules
is still out of reach due to a lack of information about the energy of those
triplet states. Yet, the access to triplet states would open up a route towards
an all-optical single-molecule photonic switch/transistor and, moreover, would
provide a way of performing coherent spin operations from the spin-less ground
state. In this work, we take an important step towards those aims by measuring
the triplet energy from the weak phosphorescence signal of perdeuterated
perylene, embedded as a guest molecule in a dibenzothiophene host matrix, which
well preserves the coherence properties of the perylene guest. We find that
perylene's phosphorescence can be enhanced in this host matrix, when acting as
an intermediary for the generation of triplet excitons. The triplet energy that
we find can be used to significantly narrow down the search for the ultra-weak
spin-forbidden transitions from the ground singlet to the triplet states of a
single molecule.

Abstract: Over the past two decades, epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have
demonstrated very promising properties as sources of single photons and
entangled photons on-demand. Among different growth methods, droplet etching
epitaxy has allowed the growth of almost strain-free QDs, with low and
controllable surface densities, small excitonic fine structure splitting (FSS),
and fast radiative decays. Here, we extend the local droplet etching technique
to In(Ga)As QDs in AlGaAs, thereby increasing the achievable emission
wavelength range beyond that accessible to GaAs/AlGaAs QDs, while benefiting
from the aforementioned advantages of this growth method. We observe QD
densities of $\sim 0.2\ \mu\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, FSS values as small as $3\
\mu\mathrm{eV}$, and short radiative lifetimes of $\sim 300\ \mathrm{ps}$,
while extending the achievable emission range to $\sim 920\ \mathrm{nm}$ at
cryogenic temperatures. We envision these QDs to be particularly suitable for
integrated quantum photonics applications.

TL;DR: Gallium oxide is a top material for photoconductive switches, and this paper shows that vertical structures perform better under certain excitation conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the performance of Ga2O3 PCSSs under different excitation conditions, which is important for high-power applications.

Method: The study compares lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 structures under intrinsic and extrinsic excitation using experiments.

Result: Vertical structures perform better under extrinsic excitation due to uniform electric fields, while lateral structures are better under intrinsic excitation in terms of photocurrent.

Conclusion: Ga2O3 PCSS geometry significantly affects performance and should be optimized based on application needs.

Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with its ultra-wide bandgap (approximately 4.8 eV) and
high breakdown field (approximately 8 MV per cm), is a leading candidate for
photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSSs) in high-power and high-speed
pulsed applications. This work, for the first time, presents a systematic
experimental comparison of lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 PCSS under both
intrinsic (245 nm) and extrinsic (280 nm, 300 nm, and 445 nm) optical
excitation. Under intrinsic excitation, where carrier generation is confined
near the surface due to the shallow absorption depth (approximately between 0.1
and 1 um), the lateral PCSS demonstrated higher photocurrent performance
compared to the vertical structure. In contrast, under extrinsic excitation,
which enables deeper penetration into the bulk, the vertical PCSS exhibited
enhanced switching performance due to a more uniform electric-field
distribution across the device volume. These results highlight the critical
role of device geometry and carrier generation mechanism in optimizing Ga2O3
PCSS performance and provide valuable guidance for developing efficient and
cost-effective high-voltage PCSSs.

Abstract: In a radiation emergency, every second counts, yet the public rarely has
immediate access to dedicated monitoring devices when they are needed most.
Here, the first practical mobile phone-based emergency ionizing radiation
detection method is presented that operates entirely without requiring camera
coverage or additional hardware modifications. Utilizing a multimodal deep
learning approach that integrates sparse radiation-induced signal distributions
with the brightness patterns, the proposed framework effectively isolates
subtle radiation signals from overwhelming visual interference. A hybrid 3D-2D
convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies radiation-induced spots from raw
mobile phone video, while a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) fuses the radiation
signal and brightness maps for the dose rate estimation. The method detects
hazardous dose rates (25-280 mRem/h) rapidly within six seconds (accuracy
86-96%), and low-level radiation (-0.6 mRem/h) with extended measurement
durations achieves 87% accuracy. The developed method greatly enhances mobile
phone radiation detection practicality and shows substantial potential as an
accessible radiation emergency detection tool.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses quantum gravity effects on entangled states, involving particle physics and black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work combines quantum gravity concepts with particle physics and gravitational phenomena to explore entanglement modifications, aiming to bridge high-energy physics with astrophysics.

Method: The first part uses QG-induced decoherence on EPR states, likely involving quantum mechanics and gravity models. The second part involves axion fields and Kerr black holes, using effective field theory and gravitational anomalies to study entanglement production.

Result: Results suggest that QG effects can induce or modify EPR-like entanglement in both particle and gravitational states, hinting at possible observable signatures or implications for quantum information theory.

Conclusion: The research opens new avenues for studying quantum gravity effects on entanglement, potentially leading to experimental tests in near-future physics.

Abstract: Some approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG) entail decoherence of quantum matter
propagating in it, due to an ``environment'' of QG degrees of freedom
inaccessible to low-energy observers. In the first part of this talk, I discuss
potential, and rather unique, effects of QG-induced decoherence on entangled
particle states, specifically an induced modification of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of entangled neutral-meson states in
meson factories ($\omega$-effect). In the second part, I summarise a recent
work in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds
surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to
superradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like
entangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left,
right) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr
geometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type
anomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions.
Depending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous
terms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS
terms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled
squeezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\omega$-effect.

Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance
instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole,
introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When
the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions
among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact
on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted
gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were
proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate
the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on
the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to
a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles
and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of
hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine
transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant
transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings,
especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory,
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and
equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the
mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through
gravitational wave observations.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper focuses on the challenges and methods for handling asynchronous computations in next-generation gravitational wave detectors. The SpECTRE code is highlighted for its use of spectral methods and task-based parallelism to improve efficiency. The paper introduces dynamic apparent horizon tracking with feedback control and applies these methods to both black hole and neutron star simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advances in gravitational wave detection require faster and more accurate simulations, pushing the limits of current computational methods. The paper addresses the complexities of implementing asynchronous parallelism for gravitational wave modeling, which is both computationally demanding and theoretically challenging.

Method: The paper presents a detailed exploration of task-based parallelism and spectral methods in the context of the SpECTRE code. It introduces a feedback control system combined with dynamic apparent horizon tracking, applying these techniques to simulate BBH and BNS mergers, leveraging the asynchronous nature of the code.

Result: The integration of these advanced methods in SpECTRE results in faster and more accurate simulations, effectively utilizing computational resources and demonstrating significant speedup and parallel efficiency.

Conclusion: By employing spectral accuracy and task-based asynchronous strategies, the SpECTRE code successfully enhances the modeling of gravitational waves, making it suitable for the upcoming era of advanced detectors with higher precision and computational demands.

Abstract: In the field of gravitational wave science, next-generation detectors will be
substantially more accurate than the current suite of detectors. Numerical
relativity simulations of binary black hole (BBH) gravitational waveforms must
become faster, more efficient, and more accurate to be used in analyses of
these next-generation detections. One approach, which the \texttt{SpECTRE} code
employs, is using spectral methods for accuracy along with synchronous
task-based parallelism to avoid idle time in simulations and make the most
efficient use of computational resources. When writing an asynchronous
application, algorithms must be redesigned compared to their synchronous
counterparts. To illustrate this process, we present novel methods for
dynamically tracking the apparent horizons in evolutions of BBH mergers using a
feedback control system, all in the context of asynchronous parallelism. We
also briefly detail how these methods can be applied to binary neutron star
simulations performed with asynchronous parallelism.

### [32] [On quantum creation of a toroidal universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08747)
*Alan H. Guth,Alexander Vilenkin*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 分析这篇论文，讨论了量子层面下平imal（即flat）三维空间和3圆环面拓扑下宇宙的创建，考虑了Casimir能量的影响。论文指出这种情况下会产生奇异的瞬时子，这些子表明在无限能量的状态下宇宙才能形成，因此无法解释为从'无'中产生。此外，如果不考虑量子修正，这个空间实际上会导致时间线不完整。论文最终得出结论，无法在半经典量子引力框架下将此量子创造与空间结构进行概率比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在这篇论文中，考虑了量子引力和宇宙拓扑学的结合，试图通过数学模型来说明宇宙的量子创建的可能性。这涉及到从无到有的过程，而这样的过程在物理上可能极其复杂，需要处理无限能量和拓扑结构等问题。因此，这样的研究具有重要的理论意义，试图探讨量子创造的可能性及其限制条件。

Method: 作者通过构建数学模型，假设存在平平坦和3圆环面拓扑的三维空间，并且考虑Casimir效应，来分析量子引力理论中的宇宙 Creation。首先，计算了这些拓扑结构下可能导致的瞬时子的存在，这些子在数学上有奇异性，意味着需要无限的能量来维持。其次，作者忽略了量子修正项，考虑了仅凭半经典近似下的时间线行为，发现其不 Completeness。最后，得出结论认为在这种情况下无法进行合理的宇宙创建概率比较。

Result: 论文的主要结论是：在考虑3圆环面的拓扑和Casimir能量后，所讨论的宇宙起始状态需要无限的能量，因此无法从'无'中量子生成。此外，在半经典近似下，空间的时间线是不完整的。因此，在半经典量子引力框架下，无法对不同拓扑结构（如球体和环面）的宇宙创建概率进行比较。

Conclusion: 作者通过研究量子层面下的三维空间和环面拓扑，得出了在半经典量子引力框架下无法使用这些拓扑结构来对比宇宙的量子创建概率，因为它们均涉及到无限能量的假设，使得比较缺乏意义。此外，得出的结论表明，这个过程可能依赖于 Planck尺度的物理现象，而半经典方法在此情况下并不可行。这种结果限制了我们对于宇宙量子起源理解的深度。

Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and
the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We
show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons
describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that
they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum
corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the
toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic
identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime
is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical
universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude
that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be
described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either
impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see
no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal
universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.

### [33] [Challenging a binary neutron star merger interpretation of GW230529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08750)
*Ivan Markin,Anna Puecher,Mattia Bulla,Tim Dietrich*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper discusses a gravitational wave detection from GW230529_181500. It suggests that the event is most likely a neutron star-black hole merger, with a chance that it could also be two massive neutron stars with spins. The paper simulates these scenarios and estimates electromagnetic counterparts, finding that they're too dim for current surveys but detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory in the early days post-merger.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve our understanding of neutron star-black hole systems and binary neutron star systems by distinguishing their gravitational wave signals, which has implications for astrophysics and cosmology. This study aims to aid in identifying the origin of GW events and the characteristics of their electromagnetic counterparts, which could advance our knowledge of these extreme astrophysical phenomena.

Method: The method involves performing parameter estimation using numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron star-black hole and binary neutron star systems. The simulations are compared to the analysis of real event data to determine the most plausible scenario. Additionally, the paper utilizes the simulation data to estimate electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the systems, considering factors like ejecta and disk wind.

Result: The main result is that GW230529_181500 is more likely a neutron star-black hole merger, but it cannot be completely ruled out as a binary neutron star merger. The electromagnetic signatures are too dim for current surveys but could be detected by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in the days following the merger.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the field by demonstrating how numerical simulations and statistical analysis can enhance the detection and characterization of gravitational wave signals. By distinguishing between competing astrophysical models and estimating electromagnetic counterparts, it aids in identifying the nature of these extreme cosmic events and their electromagnetic signatures, improving our ability to observe and understand them.

Abstract: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one
of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized
mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black
holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object
was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a
neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger.
However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy
between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models,
GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2
\mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the
distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on
simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron
star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent
with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event
data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a
neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star
origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate
the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the
systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys
if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for
additional disk wind ejecta.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many
calculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave
generation to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these
functions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental
frequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the
coupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two
strategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate
high-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first
method maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second
method fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated
coordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to
overfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the
mapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital
functional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,
we propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate
with respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass
quadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth
derivative with a fractional residual $\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.
For orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed
in Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for
computing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These
results offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time
derivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to
applications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling,
where such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave
predictions.

Conclusion: 该研究为Kaluza-Klein引力框架下的黑洞空间时间提供了额外的引力特征，通过数值分析和观测数据验证了非交换贡献和Lorentz破坏现象的影响，进一步确认了该引力理论的可行性，并指出了未来研究的方向，如加强理论与观测数据之间的联系。

Abstract: This work investigates additional gravitational features of a newly proposed
black hole spacetime within Kalb-Ramond gravity, incorporating non-commutative
corrections arising from a gauge-theoretic approach recently introduced in the
literature [arXiv:2507.17390]. Accordingly, null geodesics are solved
numerically to trace photon paths; the photon sphere and shadow are determined.
From Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements of $Sgr A^{*}$, constraints on
the parameters $\Theta$ (which encapsulates the non-commutativity) and $\ell$
(the Lorentz-violating parameter) are established. To examine the stability of
critical orbits and the deflection angle (gravitational lensing) in the weak
field scenario, we compute the Gaussian curvature in order to use the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Moreover, the deflection angle has been calculated as
well in the strong deflection limit. Furthermore, Lensing observables are
estimated using EHT data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87$. Topological features such
as the topological photon sphere are also explored.

*Sergei V. Ketov,Ekaterina O. Pozdeeva,Sergey Yu. Vernov*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper revisits $F(R)$ inflation models using ACT and DESI data, proposes a new slow-roll approximation, modifies the Starobinsky model to meet constraints, and finds that demanding a positive running spectral index narrows viable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper looks at modifying inflationary models to fit new observational data, which is important because old models might not explain the early universe as well as recent measurements suggest.

Method: The study involves analyzing evolution equations, proposing a new slow-roll description, modifying the Starobinsky model, and applying observational constraints from ACT and DESI.

Result: The modified Starobinsky model fits ACT constraints with a higher scalar tilt and positive running index, narrowing viable inflation models.

Conclusion: The new model meets current observational data, showing it's a viable approach for inflationary theory.

Abstract: The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent
observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution
equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll
approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It
is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by
demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of
scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It
is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by
modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a
positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed
slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of
the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which
satisfies all ACT constraints.

Method: 研究使用了经典场论和偏微分方程的推导方法，结合了 accelerator 环境下的不同几何条件。

Result: 推导的微分方程，并在两种加速情形下求解，结果表明电场与导电性无关。

Conclusion: 研究证实Stewart-Tolman和Ehrenfest-Tolman效应在等离子体中的相互作用，导出了静电离层方程，并发现电场独立于介质导电性。这个结果为加速等离子体动力学模型提供了理论依据，并可能适用于高能物理和天体物理等场景。

Abstract: The Stewart-Tolman effect posits that accelerating conductors exhibit both
charge separation and rest-frame electric fields (``inertia of charge''), while
the Ehrenfest-Tolman effect states that acceleration induces temperature
gradients (``inertia of heat''). We study the interplay of these effects in
thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, we derive from first principles a
partial differential equation governing the electrothermal stratification of a
fully ionized plasma in equilibrium under irrotational relativistic
accelerations in curved spacetime. We then solve it in two settings: a plasma
enclosed in a uniformly accelerated box, and a plasma shell suspended above a
black hole horizon. The resulting electric fields are found not to depend on
the electric conductivity of the medium.

Result: 该技术与传统方法效果等同，主要因素是坐标选择和插值方法的优化。

Conclusion: 这项技术的重要性可能被过度估计，其优势由其他因素主导。

Abstract: In this brief note, we demonstrate that the hyperboloidal foliation
technique, applied to the study of black hole quasinormal modes, where the
spatial boundary is shifted from spacelike infinity to the future event horizon
and null infinity, is effectively equivalent to the conventional approach, in
which the asymptotic wave function typically diverges at both ends of spatial
infinity. Specifically, although perhaps counterintuitive, a given
hyperboloidal slicing, corresponding to a particular choice of coordinates,
always uniquely determines a scheme for extracting the wave function, dictated
by the asymptotic behavior of the master equation at the spatial boundary. It
follows that the efficiency and precision observed in evaluating the
quasinormal modes should be attributed primarily to other factors, such as the
use of Chebyshev grids.

Abstract: We consider self-gravitating stationary configurations of a charged massive
complex Proca field, also known as charged Proca stars, in the particular case
of spherical symmetry. We first present a general 3+1 decomposition of the
Einstein--Maxwell--Proca system, starting from the action and field equations.
We then restrict our system to the case of spherical symmetry and, after
imposing a harmonic time dependence ansatz for the Proca field, we construct
families of charged Proca stars for different values of the charge parameter
$q$, and different values of the central Proca scalar potential $\varphi$. In a
similar way to the case of scalar boson stars, one can define a critical charge
$q=q_c$ that corresponds to the value for which the Coulomb repulsion of the
charged Proca field exactly cancels their newtonian gravitational attraction.
We find that supercritical solutions can exist for a limited range of charges
above the critical value $q>q_c$. We also consider the binding energy $E_B$ for
the different families of solutions, and find that gravitationally bound
solutions such that $E_B<0$ can only exist for subcritical charges such that
$q<q_c$, indicating that our supercritical solutions are probably dynamically
unstable against perturbations.

*Bofeng Liu,Xu Mei,Sadman Shafi,Tunan Xia,Iam-Choon Khoo,Zhiwen Liu,Xingjie Ni*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper presents a new optical neural network that uses incoherent light and spatial polarization distribution to achieve low power and high efficiency in machine learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing energy and computational demands of traditional neural networks have started to limit their future progress. Optical neural networks offer potential solutions by leveraging light-based processing, which is faster and more energy-efficient. This paper addresses the challenges associated with these optical networks, particularly the issue of weak optical nonlinearities.

Method: The method involves using incoherent light to drive the optical extreme learner. Input data is encoded in the spatial polarization distribution of an optical cavity, allowing light to pass through it multiple times to achieve nonlinear transformations. This approach minimizes the reliance on intrinsic nonlinear materials and uses a simple trainable readout.

Result: The optical learner demonstrated in the paper outperforms traditional linear digital networks in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, achieving accuracy comparable to fully nonlinear digital models. The approach is compact, energy-efficient, and scalable, making it a promising solution for practical, large-scale optical machine learning platforms.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for the development of energy-efficient and scalable optical neural network systems that can outperform their digital counterparts in various machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized fields from computer vision to
natural language processing, yet their growing energy and computational demands
threaten future progress. Optical neural networks promise greater speed,
bandwidth, and energy efficiency, but suffer from weak optical nonlinearities.
Here, we demonstrate a low-power, incoherent-light-driven optical extreme
learner that leverages 'data nonlinearity' from optical pattern reverberations,
eliminating reliance on intrinsic nonlinear materials. By encoding input data
in the spatial polarization distribution of a tailored optical cavity and
allowing light to pass through it multiple times, we achieve nonlinear
transformations at extremely low optical power. Coupled with a simple trainable
readout, our optical learner consistently outperforms linear digital networks
in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, delivering accuracy
matching fully nonlinear digital models. Our compact, energy-efficient approach
significantly reduces complexity, cost, and energy consumption, paving the way
for practical, scalable all-optical machine learning platforms.

TL;DR: The study investigates Fano resonances in a quantum photonic lattice system with a defect atom, showing how varying its properties controls transmission, acting as an energy valve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research explores particle wave phenomena in lattices, inspired by natural quantum systems and engineered photonic systems, aiming to control energy transmission.

Method: Used atom-like impurity in a photonic waveguide with S and P modes as resonances, measured transmission and fit with theoretical model aimed to control beam transport

Result: Double resonances in S and P states were observed, influenced by the atom and wavelength, validated through experiments and theory. Generated concept of energy valve for beam transmission control.

Conclusion: This system effectively controls beam transport via a single atom defect, offering insights for novel photonics applications.

Abstract: Fano resonances are a fundamental physical phenomenon that occurs when an
open channel couples with a closed one, resulting in a resonant cancellation of
transmission. In this article, we introduce a quantum simulator designed to
observe multi-orbital Fano resonances using a photonic waveguide analog. The
system consists of a homogeneous lattice, which includes a plane wave
generator, and an atom-like impurity that supports first-order (S) and
second-order (P) modes. We derive a two-impurity Fano-Anderson model to
describe this system and fit the experimental results accordingly,
demonstrating a remarkable agreement between our experimental measurements and
theoretical predictions. A comprehensive experimental characterization reveals
clear double resonances for the S and P states, which depend on the properties
of the atom and the excitation wavelength. Our results illustrate how the
transport of a propagating beam on a lattice can be effectively controlled by
simply adjusting the properties of a single external atom-like impurity, which
works as an efficient energy valve.

Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading
solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide
temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging.
While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in
nanodiamonds (NDs) introduces complexities from size, geometry, and surface
effects. NVs in NDs show altered fluorescence properties including longer
lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric
surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced
non-radiative decay, and total internal reflection. Prior models typically
addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching,
without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical
electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous
electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon
sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV
position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations
such as shallow NVs in water-coated NDs appearing brighter than deeper ones in
air and provide a unified framework for realistic emission scenarios. Unlike
previous models, our approach predicts wavelength-dependent escape efficiencies
and position-dependent variations. This integrated model informs the design of
brighter NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of
quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale dielectrics.

Abstract: Squeezed states of light play a key role in quantum-enhanced sensing and
continuous-variable quantum information processing. Realizing integrated
squeezed light sources is crucial for developing compact and scalable photonic
quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate on-chip broadband vacuum
squeezing at telecommunication wavelengths on the thin-film lithium niobate

inverse tapers and an SU-8 polymer waveguide. This configuration achieves a
fiber-to-chip coupling loss of 1.5 dB and a total homodyne detection loss of
3.9 dB, enabling a measured squeezing level of 1.4 dB, which is among the
highest reported on the TFLN platform under a continuous-wave pumping scheme.
Additional measurements in a more efficient PPLN waveguide (without low-loss
couplers) infer an on-chip squeezing level of over 12 dB at a pump power of 62

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper explores using perovskite quantum dots for thermometry and thermal imaging, showing that their photoluminescence can be used to estimate surface temperatures. They used a digital camera sensor array to create a color thermal map, successfully imaging temperature changes on a PCB. Quantum dots were encapsulated in a polymer film to improve stability and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper focuses on using non-blackbody light sources for thermometry, which is an emerging area due to the need for compact, high-precision thermal sensors.

Method: They measured the temperature-dependent photoluminescence of CsPbBr3 quantum dots in the visible spectrum. A Bayer-pattern camera sensor array was used to collect spatially resolved data, enabling temperature mapping.

Result: They demonstrated a method to visualize temperature changes on a PCB's traces with optical resolution (~500 nm) compared to traditional ~10 micrometer resolution. Encapsulation in PMMA protected the quantum dots from degradation.

Conclusion: This approach offers an alternative to conventional thermometry methods by leveraging the unique properties of perovskite quantum dots for high-resolution, compact thermal imaging applications.

Abstract: The temperature-dependent photoluminescence of perovskite quantum dots
(CsPbBr3) in the visible band, is analyzed to evaluate their suitability for
use in thermometry. A differential measurement of the photoluminescence can be
used to estimate the surface temperature. Thermal imaging is demonstrated by
using the Bayer-pattern of a cost-effective consumer-grade digital camera to
determine the spectral shift. The temperature change of traces on a printed
circuit board are visualized as proof of principle. This technique promises a
novel approach for thermal imaging of arbitrary samples with optical resolution
(wavelength of ~ 500 nm), instead of typical black-body wavelengths (~ 10
micrometer). Premature degradation of the quantum dots has been mitigated by
embedding them in a poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) film, which can then be
applied to arbitrary surfaces.

### [47] [Topological Control of Chirality and Spin with Structured Light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08733)
*Light Mkhumbuza,Pedro Ornelas,Angela Dudley,Isaac Nape,Kayn A. Forbes*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper discusses how structured light beams with particular topological properties can control spin angular momentum and optical chirality through spin-orbit interaction, without needing material interfaces. They demonstrate a free-space optical Hall effect using higher-order Poincaré modes and tunable topological charges, which can be used to separate circular polarization states. This challenges the previous belief that such effects require non-paraxial conditions and opens new opportunities for optical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to propose a novel method for achieving spin-orbit effects in free space, which is a significant advancement as traditionally these effects require material interfaces. The potential applications in optical manipulation and information processing make this interesting.

Method: The authors use structured light beams with higher-order Poincaré modes, varying the topological charge, and analyze their effects through paraxial optical models. They link the observed Hall effect to differential Gouy phase shifts and radial beam divergence.

Result: The main result is a free-space paraxial optical Hall effect where modifying the topological charge leads to spatial separation of circular polarizations.

Conclusion: The paper challenges the conventional wisdom about requiring non-paraxial conditions for spin-orbit effects and provides a scalable method for generating optical chirality and SAM through intrinsic beam properties in free space, opening new possibilities in optical technologies.

Abstract: Structured light beams with engineered topological properties offer a
powerful means to control spin angular momentum (SAM) and optical chirality,
key quantities shaped by spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in light. Such effects
are typically regarded as emerging only through light-matter interactions.
Here, we show that higher-order Poincar\'e modes, carrying a tunable
Pancharatnam topological charge $\ell_p$, enable precise control of SOI purely
from the intrinsic topology of the light field, without requiring any material
interface. In doing so, we reveal a free-space paraxial optical Hall effect,
where modulation of $\ell_p$ drives spatial separation of circular polarization
states - a direct signature of SOI in a regime previously thought immune to
such behaviour. Our analysis identifies two propagation-induced topological
mechanisms underlying this effect: differential Gouy phase shifts between
orthogonal components, and radial divergence of the beam envelope. These
results overturn the common view that spin-orbit effects in free space require
non-paraxial conditions, and establish a broadly tunable route to generating
and controlling chirality and SAM without tight focusing. This approach
provides new opportunities for optical manipulation, chiral sensing, and
high-dimensional photonic information processing.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development and characterization of a squeezed light source used in the QUEST experiment, achieving significant squeezing levels with a wide bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to enhance quantum experiments by utilizing squeezed light, which can reduce noise and improve detection sensitivities, which is crucial for quantum technologies like space-time fluctuations exploration.

Method: They used a balanced homodyne detection technique to measure the squeezed light from a Michelson interferometer setup with a power-recycled optical parametric amplifier (OPA). They achieved noise levels up to 6.8 dB and maintained at least 3 dB across the 100 MHz bandwidth.

Result: They observed up to 6.8 dB of squeezing and an inferred squeezing level of 8.6 dB after accounting for dark noise. Their device is the broadest-linewidth OPA suitable for long-term operation.

Conclusion: Their squeezed light source is effective for the Quantum Enhanced Space-Time experiment, demonstrating promising results for future quantum applications in space-time measurements.

Abstract: We report on the characterisation of one of two broadband squeezed light
sources developed for the Quantum Enhanced Space-Time (QUEST) experiment, using
balanced homodyne detection. QUEST consists of a pair of co-located, table-top,
power-recycled Michelson interferometers designed to probe stationary
space-time fluctuations. The interferometers are designed to be shot-noise
limited in the frequency range from 1 to 200 MHz, and squeezed light will be
employed with the goal to reduce the shot noise by 6 dB at frequencies inside
the linewidth of the optical parametric amplifier (OPA). We directly observed
up to 6.8 dB of squeezing and maintained at least 3 dB of squeezing across the
full 100 MHz measurement bandwidth. After accounting for the dark noise
contribution, the inferred squeezing level increased to 8.6 dB. Our squeezed
light source is based on a hemilithic OPA with a 43.6 mm round-trip optical
length and a linewidth of 138 MHz, making it the broadest-linewidth device to
date among those suitable for long-term operation.

TL;DR: The paper presents high-resolution PL spectra measurements of CaWO4:Ho3+ under varying magnetic fields, revealing hyperfine structures and showing high sensitivity to lattice strains. They developed a luminescence thermometer for low temperatures using these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to explore the detailed electronic structure of CaWO4:Ho3+ to enable accurate temperature measurements in low-temperature physics.

Method: High-resolution photoluminescence measurements, hyperfine structure analysis, magnetic field effects, and simulation of spectral behavior under strain using crystal-field parameters.

Result: Detected discrete hyperfine splits in luminescence, determined g-factors, observed sensitivity to small magnetic fields (several tenths of mT), noted higher sensitivity to lattice strain compared to absorption spectra, and successfully simulated the PL spectra.

Conclusion: They successfully developed a luminescence-based temperature sensor for around 20 K, opening new avenues in low-temperature studies of CaWO4:Ho3+ material.

Abstract: We carried out high-resolution (0.02 cm-1) measurements of the
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+, including in magnetic field, and
performed spectra modeling. Well-resolved hyperfine structure was observed in
the luminescence spectra of CaWO4:Ho3+ for the first time. Energies of several
crystal-field levels were specified, g-factors were determined. Variations of a
magnetic field as small as several tenths of mT can be detected from the PL
spectra. We show that the PL spectra are much more sensitive to lattice strains
in CaWO4:Ho3+ than the absorption spectra. The spectra were simulated using
refined crystal-field parameters and taking into account both hyperfine and
deformation interactions. Here, we used the previously obtained distribution
function of random strains induced by point lattice defects in an elastically
anisotropic CaWO4 crystal. A luminescence thermometer for temperatures around
20 K based on CaWO4:Ho3+ is suggested.

*Shun Hashiyada,An'an Wu,Yoshito Y. Tanaka*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that optical chirality can originate from the orbital angular momentum of light, which opens new avenues for understanding multipolar interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper extends traditional understanding of optical chirality, highlighting the role of orbital angular momentum beyond spin.

Method: Experiments using twisted gold nanorod dimers and circularly polarized optical vortices with matching spin and orbital angular momenta were conducted.

Result: Measured chiral dichroism persists when spin optical chirality vanishes, indicating quadrupole-mediated chirality driven by OAM with distinct resonances modulated by OAM sign.

Conclusion: Orbital optical chirality is a distinct phenomenon, and through OAM dissipation, orbital contributions dominate over spin, opening new avenues in light-matter interactions.

Abstract: Chiral light-matter interactions have traditionally been understood in terms
of electric-magnetic dipolar interference driven by light with spin angular
momentum. Here, we show that optical chirality can also originate from the
orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, giving rise to higher-order multipolar
chiral responses. Using a twisted gold nanorod dimer and tightly focused
circularly polarized optical vortex beams carrying spin and orbital angular
momenta of the same sign, we measure spectrally and spatially resolved chiral
dichroism signals that persist even where spin optical chirality vanishes,
revealing a quadrupole-mediated chiral interaction driven by OAM. The spectra
reveal clear quadrupole resonances whose spectral profile is strongly modulated
by the OAM sign, demonstrating an OAM-driven chiral interaction. Crucially, the
signal satisfies optical reciprocity, ruling out artefacts from anisotropy or
misalignment and confirming its nature as a true chiral response. Angular
momentum dissipation analysis further shows that orbital contributions dominate
over spin. These findings establish the existence of a distinct form of optical
chirality, referred to as orbital optical chirality, which opens new avenues
for probing and controlling multipolar chiral light-matter interactions beyond
the dipolar paradigm.

TL;DR: A paper presents a periscope-type optical communication terminal and a ground-based verification approach to ensure sub-second link establishment, showing significant improvements in pointing accuracy and acquisition time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the urgent need for rapid and reliable sub-second link establishment in space optical communication systems, due to increasing satellite density and complex space environments.

Method: The method involves designing a periscope-type terminal, using stellar constellation positions in inertial space as a reference for attitude determination. Error analysis identifies structural and non-structural error sources, leading to an error-compensated evaluation technique for open-loop pointing. Additionally, integrated laboratory tests and field experiments are conducted to validate the approach, focusing on both pointing precision and acquisition time.

Result: The results demonstrate that the terminal achieves high-precision pointing with mean errors reduced from 2070.24 microradians to 120.16 microradians after error correction (94% improvement) and an average acquisition time of 0.908 seconds with efficient sub-second performance.

Conclusion: The proposed terminal and verification method successfully meet the design requirements for sub-second link establishment, providing a cost-effective alternative to complex in-orbit testing.

Abstract: To meet the urgent need for sub-second link establishment in inter-satellite
and satellite-to-ground free space optical communication, this paper presents a
periscope-type optical communication terminal and a ground-based verification
scheme for its pointing accuracy and acquisition performance, thereby avoiding
costly in-orbit tests. This ground-based measurement method takes the positions
of stellar constellations in inertial space as its reference. By establishing a
theoretical attitude determination model for the optical terminal and analyzing
both structural and non-structural error sources that affect its pointing, it
proposes an error-compensated, high-precision evaluation technique for
open-loop pointing. Combined with laboratory component tests, it also derives a
measurement method for acquisition time. Field experiments show that the mean
pointing error is reduced from 2070.24 microrad to 120.16 microrad after error
correction, corresponding to an improvement exceeding 94%. Acquisition tests
report an average equivalent acquisition time of 0.908 s, with every run
completed in under 1 s. These results demonstrate that the developed terminal
achieves high-precision pointing and sub-second acquisition, and they validate
the effectiveness of the proposed ground-based verification method.

Abstract: Topological band theory has expanded into various domains in applied physics,
offering significant potential for future technologies. Recent developments
indicate that unique bulk band topology perceived for electrons can be realized
in a system of light-matter quasiparticles with reduced crystal symmetry
utilizing tunable light-matter interaction. In this work we realize
topologically non-trivial energy band dispersion of exciton-polaritons confined
in two-dimensional anisotropic materials inside an optical microcavity, and
show the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) due to non-Hermitian topology
arising from excitonic dipole oscillators with finite quasiparticle lifetime.
Fourier-plane imaging reveals two pairs of EPs connected by bulk Fermi arcs for
each of the transverse electric and magnetic polarized modes. An anisotropic
Lorentz oscillator model captures the exact band dispersion observed in our
experiment in two-dimensional momentum space. Our findings establish
anisotropic two-dimensional materials as a platform for exploring non-Hermitian
topological physics, with implications for polarization-controlled optical
technologies.

Conclusion: 该方法为生产集成式光栅陀螺仪提供了可行途径，性能可与传统光栅和光纤陀螺仪竞争。

Abstract: Optical gyroscopes based on the Sagnac effect have been widely used for
inertial navigation in aircrafts, submarines, satellites and unmanned robotics.
With the rapid progress in the field of ultrahigh-quality whispering gallery
mode and ring resonators in recent years, these devices offer the promise of a
compact alternative to ring-laser gyroscopes (RLGs) and fiber-optic gyroscopes
(FOGs). Yet, successful commercialization of a microresonator gyroscope has
been hindered by the scaling of the Sagnac effect with resonator area. While
several techniques have been proposed to enhance the Sagnac effect in
microresonators, these enhancements also amplify the thermal noise in the
microresonator. Here, we present a novel approach to measuring the Sagnac
signal in chip-scale devices that overcomes this fundamental noise limitation
to achieve unprecedented performance in a 200 {\mu}m optical resonator - the
smallest reported to date. Our proof-of-concept design shows a 10^4 enhancement
of the Sagnac signal while simultaneously suppressing thermal noise by 27 dB
and environmental contributions to noise by 22 dB. We believe this approach
offers a pathway for integrated photonic gyroscopes with sensitivities that
match or exceed RLGs and FOGs.

Conclusion: 实验成功在三棱柱晶格中探测到了DQCP现象，为理解量子相变提供了新证据，并提出了未来实验中的潜在研究方向。

Abstract: Fluctuations can drive continuous phase transitions between two distinct
ordered phases -- so-called Deconfined Quantum Critical points (DQCPs) -- which
lie beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. Despite several theoretical
predictions over the past decades, experimental evidence of DQCPs remains
elusive. We show that a DQCP can be explored in a system of Rydberg atoms
arranged on a triangular lattice and coupled through van der Waals
interactions. Specifically, we investigate the nature of the phase transition
between two ordered phases at 1/3 and at 2/3 Rydberg excitation density, which
were recently probed experimentally in [P. Scholl et al., Nature 595, 233
(2021)]. Using a field-theoretical analysis, we predict both the critical
exponents for infinitely long cylinders of increasing circumference and the
emergence of a conformal field theory near criticality showing an enlarged U(1)
symmetry -- a signature of DQCPs -- and confirm these predictions numerically.
Finally, we extend these results to ladder geometries and show how the emergent
U(1) symmetry could be probed experimentally using finite tweezer arrays.

*Hao-Yue Qi,Wei Zheng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Summary: The paper introduces a new technique called split spectroscopy to detect entanglement in quantum many-body systems by showing a single peak if and only if the state is triseparable. They demonstrate this using spin models and propose an experimental protocol with Rydberg atoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivations for this paper stem from the challenge of detecting quantum entanglement, particularly in many-particle systems, which is a significant hurdle in quantum information processing and many-body physics.

Method: The paper utilizes split spectroscopy method, which they claim exhibits a single delta-function peak exactly when the analyzed eigenstate is triseparable. They validate this through two spin models undergoing quantum phase transitions and present a protocol using Rydberg atom arrays.

Result: The results reveal that split spectroscopy effectively distinguishes between entangled and non-entangled states with single peaks for triseparable states. Additionally, the spectral entropy proved effective in detecting quantum phase transitions, capturing the scaling of entanglement entropy.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that split spectroscopy is a novel and practical method for detecting entanglement in quantum many-body systems, providing insights into quantum phase transitions through its mathematical relationship with entanglement entropy and offering an implementable experimental protocol using Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is recognized as a fundamental resource in quantum
information processing and is essential for understanding quantum many-body
physics. However, experimentally detecting entanglement, particularly in
many-particle quantum states, remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose
split spectroscopy as an experimentally feasible technique for detecting
entanglement of eigenstates in quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate the
split spectroscopy exhibits a single delta-function peak if and only if the
investigated eigenstate is triseparable. Our framework is illustrated using two
paradigmatic spin models that undergo quantum phase transitions. Furthermore,
we show that the spectral entropy serves as a powerful indicator of quantum
phase transitions and captures the scaling behavior of entanglement. Finally,
we present an experimental protocol using Rydberg atom arrays.

### [58] [Derivation from classical Majorana--Bloch equation to quantum von Neumann equation for any angular momenta in coherent states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08414)
*Lihong V. Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a renaming of the Bloch equation to the Majorana-Bloch equation by highlighting Majorana's earlier work. The authors extend their previous derivation of this relationship to higher spins using coherent states, establishing an invertible mapping between the von Neumann and Majorana-Bloch equations. They use the Ehrenfest theorem to show that the expectation values align with classical equations of motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for proper attribution or renaming in academic contexts is evident, especially when earlier foundational work is overlooked or underappreciated. This paper addresses that by recognizing Majorana's contribution while maintaining Bloch's name, and extends the framework for broader applications in quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors derive the Majorana-Bloch equation from the von Neumann equation and then generalize it to higher spins using the polynomial representation of coherent-state projectors. They establish an invertible mapping and validate it using the Ehrenfest theorem with expectation values.

Result: The paper successfully renames the equation, extends the formalism to higher spins, and demonstrates the validity and applicability of the new framework through theoretical derivations and expectation value analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed Majorana-Bloch equation offers a novel perspective for studying higher spin systems, providing both a renaming recognition of earlier work and a robust mathematical foundation for quantum dynamics in such states.

Abstract: After publishing the derivation from the classical Bloch equation to the
quantum von Neumann equation to the Schr\"odinger--Pauli equation for spin-1/2,
we proposed renaming the Bloch equation to the Majorana--Bloch equation because
Majorana's work predated Bloch's in the presentation of the Bloch equation by
14 years. Here, we generalize our previous derivation to higher spins or
angular momenta in coherent pure states. Using the polynomial representation of
the coherent-state projector, we derive an invertible mapping from the
Majorana--Bloch equation to the von Neumann equation, establishing a one-to-one
correspondence between these two formalisms. Application of the Ehrenfest
theorem also shows that expectation values in these states reproduce the
classical equation of motion.

Abstract: Single neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays offer a promising platform for
high-fidelity quantum computing at local nodes. Nonetheless, creating
entanglement between remote nodes in a distributed quantum network remains
challenging due to inherently weak atom-light coupling. Here, we design a
distributed quantum network architecture in which cold atomic ensembles with
strong atom-light interactions act as quantum antennas, interfacing single-atom
qubits with flying photons to enable high-efficiency atom-photon entanglement
generation -- analogous to the role of antennas in classical communication.
Using realistic experimental parameters, we estimate an efficiency of $\eta
\simeq 0.548$ for generating atom-photon entanglement, a probability of $P_{E}
\simeq 6 \%$ for generating atom-atom entanglement, and a remote entanglement
generation rate of $16.6 $ kHz. This performance not only surpasses that of
state-of-the-art cavity-based or high-numerical-aperture-lens-based
architectures but also offers notable advantages in simplicity, tunability, and
experimental accessibility. Our scheme also integrates a long-lived quantum
memory, providing a storage advantage for quantum repeater design. By
leveraging the complementary strengths of single-atom qubits for local
operations and cold atomic ensembles for networking, this approach paves the
way for scalable distributed quantum computing and sensing.

Abstract: We use the free evolution propagator to determine the quantum probability
representation (i.e., the general expression of the tomogram) of any
one-dimensional system described by a density state. The evolution operator for
the considered quantum system is additionally used to establish the
corresponding time dependent tomogram. Applications are given for a Gaussian
wave packet, the quantum shutter related with the phenomenon of diffraction in
time, the double quantum shutter, and a finite potential. A generalisation to
describe $N$ particle systems is also presented and, in particular, we find the
tomogram associated to the 2 particle case occupying in general non-orthogonal
states. In the latter case, for a bipartite quantum system, the entanglement
properties are established by considering quantum information concepts such as
the linear entropy.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于其他固态平台，提供了构建大规模纠缠态的基础。

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is an essential aspect of quantum systems, needed
to execute quantum algorithms, implement error correction, and achieve
quantum-enhanced sensing. In solid-state quantum registers such
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, entangled states are typically
created using sequential, pairwise gates between the central electron and
individual nuclear qubits. This sequential approach is slow and suffers from
crosstalk errors. Here, we demonstrate a parallelized multi-qubit entangling
gate to generate a four-qubit GHZ state using a room-temperature NV center in
only 14.8 $\mu$s $-$ 10 times faster than using sequences of two-qubit gates.
The entangled states are verified by measuring multiple quantum coherences.
Two-qubit entangling gates have an average fidelity of 0.96(1), and the
four-qubit parallel gate has a fidelity of 0.92(4), whereas the sequential
four-qubit gate fidelity is only 0.69(3). The approach is generalizable to
other solid-state platforms, and it lays the foundation for scalable generation
and control of entanglement in practical devices.

Conclusion: 该方法为实现精确控制提供了理论框架和指导。

Abstract: We address the control of the dynamics of both population and coherence phase
in an open two-level quantum system employing a single external control field.
The system dynamics is described by a Markovian master equation that takes into
account dephasing and thermal noise. The control is engineered by inverting the
underlying equations of motion, which yields an analytical expression for the
control field in terms of user-specified time-dependent functions for the
population and coherence phase. Our approach allows to dictate not only the
initial and final populations and phases, but the full dynamics of these
quantities. The chosen functions for population and phase have to conform to
certain constraints indicated in our analysis. Our methodology also reveals the
possible transitions for given initial conditions and environmental noise
parameters.

Abstract: Reconstructing the density matrix of the quantum state of photons through a
tomographically complete set of measurements, known as quantum state
tomography, is an essential task in nearly all applications of quantum science
and technology, from quantum sensing to quantum communications. Recent advances
in optical metasurfaces enable the design of ultra-thin nanostructured optical
elements performing such state tomography tasks, promising greater simplicity,
miniaturization, and scalability. However, reported metasurfaces on this goal
were limited to a small Hilbert dimension, e.g., polarization qubits or spatial
qudits with only a few states. When scaling up to higher-dimensional qudit
tomography problems, especially those involving spatial qudits, a natural
question arises: whether a metasurface with randomized nanostructures is
sufficient to perform such qudit tomography, achieving optimal conditions. In
this work, we attempt to answer this question through a set of numerical
experiments with random metasurfaces, utilizing large-scale simulations of over
11,000 distinct metasurfaces each exceeding 200 wavelengths in size. We show
that with sufficient redundancy in the number of detectors, random metasurfaces
perform reasonably well in quantum photonic spatial qudit tomography encoded in
Hermite-Gaussian states for up to approximately 10 states. Furthermore, we
discuss additional considerations for optimizing metasurfaces in multi-photon
cases. Our work opens a pathway toward computationally efficient, miniaturized,
and error-tolerant quantum measurement platforms.

Abstract: We study the dynamics on the flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (AFB) lattices
using a digital quantum computer. By utilizing an advanced tensor network
method to compress the quantum circuit, we overcome the intrinsic limitations
of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. This enables
high-fidelity simulations of time evolution over extended timescales and
various interesting dynamical behaviours are observed in our digital quantum
simulation. We start from the quantum simulation of the single-particle quantum
walk on the FB and AFB lattices, which are realized by tuning the magnetic flux
per plaquette to $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\pi$ respectively. With compressed quantum
circuit, we are able to simulate the delocalization in FB lattice and the
Aharonov-Bohm caging in AFB lattice. Next, we integrate FB and ABF lattices
within a one-dimensional lattice structure and study how these lattices can be
utilized to control quantum transport. Moreover, we investigate the
effectiveness of a single ABF lattice in controlling the two particles dynamics
without and with interaction. We find that the hopping amplitude remains an
effective and tunable parameter for controlling particle transport even in the
presence of interactions. Our results show that digital quantum simulations of
flat-band physics are feasible on current digital NISQ devices through circuit
compression. Moreover, this capability enables us to study the potential
applications of flat-band systems in quantum control and emerging quantum

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is the fastest-growing and relatively mature
technology in the field of quantum information, enabling
information-theoretically secure key distribution between two remote users.
Although QKD based on off-the-shelf telecom components has been validated in
both laboratory and field tests, its high cost and large volume remain major
obstacles to large-scale deployment. Photonic integration, featured by its
compact size and low cost, offers an effective approach to addressing the above

local local oscillator continuous-variable (CV) QKD system based on an
integrated silicon photonic transmitter and receiver. By employing a high-speed
silicon photonic integrated in-phase and quadrature modulator, a low-noise and
high bandwidth silicon photonic integrated heterodyne detector, and digital

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endogenous security in wireless communications and the use of CV-QKD with generalized receivers to enhance security and compatibility in realistic channel conditions.

Method: Used CD-Kennedy receiver with EGC and analytically derived SKR and BER for CV-QKD in turbulent channels compared to homodyne receivers.

Result: CD-Kennedy outperforms homodyne receivers in both BER and SKR, with opposite trends as average transmittance increases, and robust SKR performance in turbulence.

Conclusion: CD-Kennedy receiver is effective for CV-QKD in turbulent channels, improving both BER and SKR with optimized settings for separate purposes.

Abstract: Endogenous security in next-generation wireless communication systems
attracts increasing attentions in recent years. A typical solution to
endogenous security problems is the quantum key distribution (QKD), where
unconditional security can be achieved thanks to the inherent properties of
quantum mechanics. Continuous variable-quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) enjoys
high secret key rate (SKR) and good compatibility with existing optical
communication infrastructure. Traditional CV-QKD usually employ coherent
receivers to detect coherent states, whose detection performance is restricted
to the standard quantum limit. In this paper, we employ a generalized Kennedy
receiver called CD-Kennedy receiver to enhance the detection performance of
coherent states in turbulent channels, where equal-gain combining (EGC) method
is used to combine the output of CD-Kennedy receivers. Besides, we derive the
SKR of a post-selection based CV-QKD protocol using both CD-Kennedy receiver
and homodyne receiver with EGC in turbulent channels. We further propose an
equivalent transmittance method to facilitate the calculation of both the
bit-error rate (BER) and SKR. Numerical results show that the CD-Kennedy
receiver can outperform the homodyne receiver in turbulent channels in terms of
both BER and SKR performance. We find that BER and SKR performance advantage of
CD-Kennedy receiver over homodyne receiver demonstrate opposite trends as the
average transmittance increases, which indicates that two separate system
settings should be employed for communication and key distribution purposes.
Besides, we also demonstrate that the SKR performance of a CD-Kennedy receiver
is much robust than that of a homodyne receiver in turbulent channels.

Abstract: Quantum computing and machine learning are state-of-the-art technologies
which have been investigated intensively in both academia and industry. The
hybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to
solve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as
combinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of
next-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a
black-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing
(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization
Machine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled
from a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).
According to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on
exploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced
performance of exploration and exploitation which we call
exploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests
to compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA
certainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms
FMA in speed and accuracy. In addition, the performance of SFMA can be further
improved by sequentially using two subsampling datasets with different sizes
such that the size of the latter dataset is substantially smaller than the
former. Such a substantial reduction not only enhances the exploration
performance of SFMA but also enables us to run it with correspondingly low
computational cost even for a large-scale problem. These results indicate the
effectiveness of SFMA in a certain class of black-box optimization problems of
significant size: the potential scalability of SFMA in solving large-scale
problems with correspondingly low computational cost.

trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery
of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score
matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the
reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz
recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow
reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our
framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse
Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery
channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches
to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information
science.

Abstract: The advantage of attosecond measurements is the possibility of time-resolving
ultrafast quantum phenomena of electron dynamics. Many such measurements are of
interferometric nature, and therefore give access to the phase. Likewise, weak
measurements are intrinsically interferometric and specifically take advantage
of interfering probability amplitudes, therefore encoding the phase information
of the process. In this work, we show that attosecond interferometry
experiments can be seen as a weak measurement, which unveils how this notion is
connected to strong field physics and attosecond science. In particular, we
show how the electron trajectory picks up a new phase, which occurs due to the
weak measurement of the process. This phase can show significant contributions
in the presence of spectral features of the measured system. Furthermore,
extending this approach to include non-classical driving fields shows that the
generated harmonics exhibit non-trivial features in their quantum state and
photon statistics. This opens the path towards investigations of attosecond
quantum interferometry experiments.

Result: 在有限量子资源下，EPSR显著提高了导数估计的精度。

Conclusion: EPSR是一种更有效、更通用的参数偏移规则，特别适用于处理复杂参数化量子电路。

Abstract: Parameter shift rules (PSRs) are useful methods for computing arbitrary-order
derivatives of the cost function in parameterized quantum circuits. The basic
idea of PSRs is to evaluate the cost function at different parameter shifts,
then use specific coefficients to combine them linearly to obtain the exact
derivatives. In this work, we propose an extended parameter shift rule (EPSR)
which generalizes a broad range of existing PSRs and has the following two
advantages. First, EPSR offers an infinite number of possible parameter shifts,
allowing the selection of the optimal parameter shifts to minimize the final
derivative variance and thereby obtaining the more accurate derivative
estimates with limited quantum resources. Second, EPSR extends the scope of the
PSRs in the sense that EPSR can handle arbitrary Hermitian operator $H$ in gate
$U(x) = \exp (iHx)$ in the parameterized quantum circuits, while existing PSRs
are valid only for simple Hermitian generators $H$ such as simple Pauli words.
Additionally, we show that the widely used ``general PSR'', introduced by
Wierichs et al. (2022), is a special case of our EPSR, and we prove that it
yields globally optimal shifts for minimizing the derivative variance under the
weighted-shot scheme. Finally, through numerical simulations, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of EPSR and show that the usage of the optimal parameter
shifts indeed leads to more accurate derivative estimates.

Abstract: In this study, the energy spectrum and thermal equilibrium states of the
finite-size Dicke-Stark model were numerically obtained within the extended
coherent state space by solving the dressed master equation for strongly
coupled light-atom systems. The critical point of the superradiant phase
transition in the infinite-size Dicke-Stark model was analytically derived
using the mean-field approach and confirmed with numerical calculation. Under
thermal equilibrium conditions, analyses of the negativity, zero-time-delay
two-photon correlation function, and atom-spin squeezing parameters in the
finite-size Dicke-Stark model reveal that as the coupling strength increases,
the light field undergoes a transition from photon bunching to anti-bunching
and then back to bunching. The Stark field can modulate both the maximum and
minimum values of the two-photon correlation function and their corresponding
coupling strengths. At low temperatures, the system exhibits entanglement and
spin squeezing. As temperature rises, entanglement gradually diminishes, while
strong coupling facilitates the preservation of entanglement in the system
state. Atom-spin squeezing spin squeezing is highly sensitive to temperature
and vanishes rapidly with increasing temperature. This work contributes to the
fundamental understanding of quantum phenomena in Dicke-Stark systems.

Motivation: Achieving quantum advantage in the NISQ era is crucial, and this paper addresses challenges in demonstrating it by developing efficient quantum solvers.

Method: Proposed Rsra algorithm reduces qubits and time complexity, enhanced QAOA and QAA solvers implemented on a superconducting processor.

Result: Enhanced solvers outperform classical methods, providing empirical quantum speedup for NISQ problems.

Conclusion: This work moves towards practical quantum computing applications in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage remains a key milestone in the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era. Without rigorous complexity proofs, scaling
advantage-where quantum resource requirements grow more slowly than their
classical counterparts-serves as the primary indicator. However, direct
applications of quantum optimization algorithms to classically intractable
problems have yet to demonstrate this advantage. To address this challenge, we
develop enhanced quantum solvers for the NP-complete one-in-three Boolean
satisfiability problem. We propose a restricting space reduction algorithm
(RSRA) that achieves optimal search space dimensionality, thereby reducing both
qubits and time complexity for various quantum solvers. Extensive numerical
investigations on problem instances with up to 65 variables demonstrate that
our enhanced quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum
adiabatic algorithm (QAA)-based solvers outperform state-of-the-art classical
solvers, with the QAA-based solver providing a lower bound for our method while
exhibiting scaling advantage. Furthermore, we experimentally implement our
enhanced solvers on a superconducting quantum processor with 13 qubits,
confirming the predicted performance improvements. Collectively, our results
provide empirical evidence of quantum speedup for an NP-complete problem.

Motivation: 随着量子计算的发展，量子变分算法在优化问题中展现出巨大潜力，但其中的 barren plateau 现象一直是挑战。研究 BP 有助于改进算法性能。

Result: 三种 BP 类型的识别，以及通过优化提高 QEA 的效率。

Conclusion: BP 分析指出了改进方向，遗传优化有助于缓解这些问题。

Abstract: We investigate the barren plateau (BP) phenomenon in variational quantum
algorithms using a statistical approach. Using Gaussian function models, we
identify three distinct types of BPs. The first type, which we called
localized-dip BPs, occurs in landscapes that are mostly flat but contain a dip
point where the gradient is large in a small region around the minimum. The
second type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the
localized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called
everywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with
almost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.
After illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend
the analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two
types of ans\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz.
For both ans\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs. Using our
statistical approach, we searched for localized-dip and localized-gorge BPs but
found no evidence of such features in the examples studied, suggesting that
everywhere-flat BPs dominate in these ans\"atze. Our method effectively probes
landscape features by capturing the gradient scaling across parameter space,
making it a useful tool for diagnosing BPs in variational algorithms. To
mitigate BPs in the VQE, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the
random gates generated in the ans\"atze, thereby reshaping the cost function
landscape to enhance the optimization efficiency. A comparison with an
unoptimized ansatz shows how the ansatz design can improve the scalability and
reliability of variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides constitute a
paradigmatic quantum-optical platform for exploring collective phenomena in
open quantum many-body systems. For appropriately spaced emitters, they realize
the Dicke model, whose characteristic permutation symmetry allows for efficient
exact solutions featuring superradiance. When the emitters are arbitrarily
spaced, however, this symmetry is lost and general analytical solutions are no
longer available. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical method to study
the dynamics of such systems by extending the time-dependent neural quantum
state (t-NQS) framework to open quantum systems. We benchmark our approach
across a range of waveguide QED settings and compare its performance with
tensor-network calculations. Our results demonstrate that the t-NQS approach is
competitive with other numerical methods and highlight the potential of t-NQSs
for studying open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium.

Abstract: In the framework of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), a measurement in one
basis gives \emph{no information} about the outcomes of measurements in another
basis. Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes
to be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution
$q=(q_0,\cdots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is
preserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any
preparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is
chosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect
to the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of
this, we define the notion of \emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such
that within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of
the other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to
each other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual
equi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading
for $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\le\mu \le 1/2$ where
$\mu=\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements
in MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective
measurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty
inequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated
entanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed
from MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same
number of bases, for certain values of the index $\mu$, employing a larger set
of MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic
states of a $3\times 3$ system.

Motivation: The Petz recovery map is a key protocol in quantum information theory aiming to recover information lost due to noise. Implementing it experimentally with current quantum platforms is crucial for demonstrating its feasibility and relevance for error correction.

Method: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processors were used, employing the DQC algorithm. They operated on two single-qubit channels: phase damping and amplitude damping.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 展示了数值模拟中通过有限维截断Fock空间进行广义压缩的奇怪行为：即使状态空间的维度很大，结果也取决于截断维数的奇偶性。这个问题让结果是否物理上可接受产生了疑问。我们表明，截断方案对应两个不同的well-defined的、不同单位ary演化，这些演化由生成器（Hamiltonian）位于无限维Fock空间的不同子集上。这实际上是由于广义压缩Hamiltonian在有限激发态上没有被良好定义的自共轭，而有多个自共轭扩展。此外，我们展示了偶奇截断尺寸的压缩算子的光谱，使得我们了解了这两种不同自共轭扩展的性质。为了使压缩算子适配物理系统，必须通过其他项对其进行正则化，这些项取决于实验的实现细节。添加了Kerr相互作用项作为H中的项以后，仿真结果不再依赖截断尺寸的奇偶性，并且稳态H是自共轭的，这样就可从物理上解释了。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  This paper explored the unexpected behavior in numerical simulations of generalized squeezing with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space. The key findings revealed that the simulation results depend on the parity of the truncation dimension, which raises concerns about their physical significance. Furthermore, it was found that the behavior is tied to the self-adjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian, suggesting that the role of additional physical terms, such as Kerr interactions, plays a crucial role in achieving physically meaningful results. This paper is interesting because it bridges numerical methods with theoretical physics, particularly in the context of infinite-dimensional spaces and their finite approximations., 

Method:  The paper uses numerical simulations of the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian with finite-dimensional Fock space truncations. It compares the effects of even and odd truncations and analyzes the Hamiltonian's self-adjoint extensions. Additionally, it investigates the impact of adding a Kerr interaction term on convergence and physical interpretability. The approach combines theoretical analysis with numerical experiments, focusing on operator extensions and Hamiltonian regularization for physical relevance., 

Result:  The results revealed that the numerical simulations are sensitive to the parity of the truncation dimension, with even and odd truncations leading to distinct unitary evolutions. The paper demonstrates that the generalized squeezing Hamiltonian has multiple self-adjoint extensions, each corresponding to different physical evolutions. By adding a Kerr interaction term, the Hamiltonian becomes self-adjoint, leading to simulation results that are independent of truncation parity and physically meaningful., 

Conclusion: This paper provides insights into how numerical methods for simulating infinite-dimensional quantum systems can lead to parity-dependent results. By considering self-adjoint extensions and incorporating physically relevant terms, such as the Kerr interaction, the simulations can be made robust and physically meaningful. This work underscores the importance of understanding the mathematical structure of Hamiltonians in finite-dimensional approximations to ensure physical correctness in numerical studies. 

Abstract: We show unexpected behaviour in simulations of generalized squeezing
performed with finite-dimensional truncations of the Fock space: even for
extremely large dimension of the state space, the results depend on whether the
truncation dimension is even or odd. This situation raises the question whether
the simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact,
the two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary
evolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the
infinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the
generalized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite
excitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we
present results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to
even and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different
self-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To
make the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize
it by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental
implementation. We show that the addition of a Kerr interaction term in the
Hamiltonian leads to uniquely converging simulations, with no dependence on the
parity of the truncation size, and demonstrate that the Kerr term indeed
renders the Hamiltonian self-adjoint and thus physically interpretable.

*Philipp Stammer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by analyzing a driven cavity in an unstructured environment with Markovian dynamics. It connects HHG with open systems and driven-dissipative systems, showing emission characteristics are isomorphic to high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. The quantum regression theorem is used to derive the upper bound of radiated power due to emitter fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is focused on high harmonic generation (HHG), a fundamental quantum optical phenomenon. The authors aim to extend existing quantum optical models by incorporating quantum stochastic analysis, particularly in an open system environment. The motivation likely stems from the desire to better understand the dynamics of HHG in realistic scenarios where the system interacts with an environment, leading to noise and dissipation. This could have implications for various applications such as vacuumuum laser, ultrafast imaging, and quantum information processing.

Method: The method involves modeling the interaction between a driven cavity field and an unstructured environment using quantum stochastic analysis. The authors solve the quantum Langevin equation under Markovian assumptions, which simplifies the environment's memory effects. They use the quantum regression theorem to analyze the dynamics of the system. Additionally, they derive an upper bound for the radiated power by considering the contributions from the emitter fluctuations, which likely involves calculating noise sources and their effects on the radiated fields.

Result: The key results showed that the emission characteristics of the driven cavity in an unstructured environment are isomorphic to both high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This duality provides new insights into the emission mechanisms, suggesting that the driven cavity acts as an efficient emitter in these processes. The use of the Markovian approximation allowed the authors to establish a theoretical framework connecting HHG with open systems. Furthermore, the upper bound on radiated power offers a quantitative limit on the efficiency of the emission process, highlighting the role of emitter fluctuations in noise and dissipation. By linking HHG with driven-dissipative systems, the paper opens up new avenues for studying and controlling these processes in practical applications.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges high harmonic generation with open quantum systems theory, specifically through the analysis of a driven cavity coupled to an unstructured environment. By using quantum stochastic methods and the quantum regression theorem, the authors demonstrate a isomorphism between the emission processes and high harmonic generation, as well as a non-linear antenna. This connection not only deepens the theoretical understanding of HHG but also provides a framework for analyzing driven-dissipative systems, which is crucial for advancing quantum optics and related technologies. The derived upper bound on radiated power adds a practical element, quantifying the maximum efficiency achievable in such systems.

Abstract: This work extends quantum optical models of high harmonic generation by
considering a quantum stochastic analysis of the field modes coupled to an
environment. In particular, we study the open system dynamics by solving the
quantum Langevin equation for a non-linear driven cavity coupled to the
environment. For an unstructured environment without memory, we show that the
emission characteristics of the intense driven cavity is isomorphic to the
process of high harmonic generation and a non-linear antenna. This is achieved
by using the quantum regression theorem for the Markovian dynamics, and further
allows to obtain the upper bound of the radiated power due to the emitter
fluctuations. This opens the path to connect current quantum optical approaches
of HHG with open system descriptions and towards driven-dissipative systems in
the non-linear regime.

Motivation: The authors investigate whether quantum game theory can be practically implemented on current quantum hardware, addressing the significant challenges like noise and limited qubit connections.

Method: The authors use IBM's ibm sherbrooke processor and the EWL framework. They test four quantum strategies across 31 entanglement values, using 2048 shots. They developed a Guided Circuit Mapping (GCM) method to mitigate noise by dynamically selecting qubits and optimizing routing.

Result: The study shows up to 108% payoff improvement over classical equilibrium but notes hardware-induced deviations, with experimental results within 3.5%-12% relative error.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that quantum advantages in strategic coordination are achievable under realistic NISQ conditions, offering a pathway for practical applications.

Abstract: Implementing quantum game theory on real hardware is challenging due to
noise, decoherence, and limited qubit connectivity, yet such demonstrations are
essential to validate theoretical predictions. We present one of the first full
experimental realizations of the Battle of the Sexes game under the
Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) framework on IBM Quantum's ibm sherbrooke
superconducting processor. Four quantum strategies (I, H, $R(\pi/4)$, $R(\pi)$)
were evaluated across 31 entanglement values $\gamma \in [0, \pi]$ using 2048
shots per configuration, enabling a direct comparison between analytical
predictions and hardware execution. To mitigate noise and variability, we
introduce a Guided Circuit Mapping (GCM) method that dynamically selects qubit
pairs and optimizes routing based on real-time topology and calibration data.
The analytical model forecasts up to $108\%$ payoff improvement over the
classical equilibrium, and despite hardware-induced deviations, experimental
results with GCM preserve the expected payoff trends within $3.5\%$-$12\%$
relative error. These findings show that quantum advantages in strategic
coordination can persist under realistic NISQ conditions, providing a pathway
toward practical applications of quantum game theory in multi-agent, economic,
and distributed decision-making systems.

Abstract: The creation of large-scale, high-fidelity quantum computers is not only a
fundamental scientific endeavour in itself, but also provides increasingly
robust proofs of quantum computational advantage (QCA) in the presence of
unavoidable noise and the dynamic competition with classical algorithm
improvements. To overcome the biggest challenge of photon-based QCA

the matrix product state (MPS) method, which was recently proposed to utilise
photon loss to reduce the classical simulation complexity of the GBS. Using the

using a quantum computer and examine how the simulation results compare with
the theoretical predictions. The experiment involves both protective and

collapse, the former combines weak interactions with a protective mechanism
thereby preserving the photon wave function coherence until its final
detection. The simulation gives insights as to how efficient quantum computers
can be in simulating actual physical systems as the amount of computation
increases.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of
conserved, non-commuting charges, and a fundamental goal is to determine the
minimum energy of the system subject to constraints on the charges. Recently,
[Liu et al., arXiv:2505.04514] proposed first- and second-order classical and
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for solving a dual chemical potential
maximization problem, and they proved that these algorithms converge to global
optima by means of gradient-ascent approaches. In this paper, we benchmark
these algorithms on several problems of interest in thermodynamics, including
one- and two-dimensional quantum Heisenberg models with nearest and
next-to-nearest neighbor interactions and with the charges set to the total
$x$, $y$, and $z$ magnetizations. We also offer an alternative compelling
interpretation of these algorithms as methods for designing ground and thermal
states of controllable Hamiltonians, with potential applications in molecular
and material design. Furthermore, we introduce stabilizer thermodynamic systems
as thermodynamic systems based on stabilizer codes, with the Hamiltonian
constructed from a given code's stabilizer operators and the charges
constructed from the code's logical operators. We benchmark the aforementioned
algorithms on several examples of stabilizer thermodynamic systems, including
those constructed from the one-to-three-qubit repetition code, the perfect
one-to-five-qubit code, and the two-to-four-qubit error-detecting code.
Finally, we observe that the aforementioned hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, when applied to stabilizer thermodynamic systems, can serve as
alternative methods for encoding qubits into stabilizer codes at a fixed
temperature, and we provide an effective method for warm-starting these
encoding algorithms whenever a single qubit is encoded into multiple physical
qubits.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development of optical control techniques for Er³⁺ ions, enabling qubit storage and advanced quantum network applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance quantum networking by developing methods to address and control individual spins in solid-state systems, which are challenging due to spatial separation and interactions.

Method: The study uses Er³⁺ ions, characterized by their narrow optical linewidth, to achieve frequency-domain control. They demonstrate two-qubit gates, quantum non-demolition measurements, and electron-nuclear gates, showing scalable techniques for quantum nodes.

Result: Successfully implemented coherent optical and spin control on interacting Er³⁺ ions, demonstrated two-qubit gates, and effective qubit storage using nuclear spins, implying potential scalability for quantum networks.

Conclusion: These techniques pave the way for multiplexed quantum network nodes, enhancing quantum communication and processing capabilities.

Abstract: Optically addressed atomic defects in the solid-state are widely used as
single-photon sources and memories for quantum network applications. The
solid-state environment allows for a high density of electron and nuclear spins
with the potential to form registers for coherent information processing.
However, it is challenging to reliably address individual spins at nanometer
separations where interactions are large. Rare-earth ions offer a unique
solution, as their narrow homogeneous optical linewidth allows frequency-domain
resolution of a large number of emitters without regard to their spatial
separation. In this work, we realize coherent optical and spin control of a
pair of interacting Er$^{3+}$ ions, together with a nearby nuclear spin
ancilla. We demonstrate two-qubit electron-electron gates and use them to
perform repeated quantum non-demolition measurements on one of the Er$^{3+}$
ions. We also demonstrate electron-nuclear gates to allow coherent storage and
retrieval of qubit information in a nuclear spin, and show that the nuclear
spin coherence survives readout of the electron spin. These techniques can be
readily scaled to larger numbers of electron and nuclear spins, paving the way
for massively multiplexed quantum network nodes.

Abstract: Quantum resources are certain features of the quantum world that provide
advantages in certain information-theoretic, thermodynamic, or any other useful
operational tasks that are outside the realm of what classical theories can
achieve. Quantum resource theories provide us with an elegant framework for
studying these resources quantitatively and rigorously. While numerous
state-based quantum resource theories have already been investigated, and to
some extent, measurement-based resource theories have also been explored,
instrument-based resource theories remain largely unexplored, with only a few
notable exceptions. As quantum instruments are devices that provide both the
classical outcomes of induced measurements and the post-measurement quantum
states, they are quite important, especially for scenarios where multiple
parties sequentially act on a quantum system. In this work, we study several
instrument-based resource theories, namely (1) the resource theory of
information preservability, (2) the resource theory of (strong) entanglement
preservability, (3) the resource theory of (strong) incompatibility
preservability, (4) the resource theory of traditional incompatibility, and (5)
the resource theory of parallel incompatibility. Furthermore, we outline the
hierarchies of these instrument-based resources and provide measures to
quantify them. In short, we provide a detailed framework for several
instrument-based quantum resource theories.

Conclusion: 该文通过详细比较两种方法，解决了操作员带来的新矛盾，并为理解dS环路效应和相互作用项的修正提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically
understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy
with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops
that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In
contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that
the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent,
particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these
issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral
representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We
review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS
correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex
operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel
complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between
different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal
series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer
new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why
renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET
is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.

### [90] [Holographic Correlators from Thermal Bootstrap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08373)
*Ilija Burić,Ivan Gusev,Andrei Parnachev*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method to compute double-trace thermal coefficients more efficiently by using Euclidean periodicity and Padé-Borel resummation, and these coefficients are highly accurate compared to solving PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to simplify the computation of holographic thermal correlators, especially the challenging double-trace contributions, which are currently difficult to compute accurately.

Method: The method involves applying the Euclidean periodicity condition (KMS condition) to the holographic correlator and using Padé-Borel resummation to improve the series convergence.

Result: The method leads to fast-converging series with highly accurate numerical results that match solutions from partial differential equation methods.

Conclusion: This approach provides an efficient and reliable alternative for computing double-trace coefficients in holographic thermal correlators, improving on existing techniques that struggle with accuracy.

Abstract: Holographic thermal two-point functions can be analyzed using the operator
product expansion which contains contributions from both multi-stress-tensor
and double-trace operators. The former can be computed by analyzing the bulk
equation of motion in a near-boundary expansion, but the latter has remained
elusive-in practice, one resorts to solving a partial differential equation
with limited accuracy. We show that imposing the Euclidean periodicity
condition on the holographic correlator (also known as the KMS condition or
thermal bootstrap), followed by Pad\'e-Borel resummation, provides an efficient
method for computing double-trace thermal coefficients. The resulting series
converges rapidly and yields numerical values in excellent agreement with those
obtained from solving the partial differential equation.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of planons, particles whose mobility is restricted to a
plane, through the classification of coadjoint orbits and unitary irreducible
representations of the centrally extended planon group. Planons are closely
related to Galilei/Bargmann symmetries and, remarkably, the often-ignored
massless coadjoint orbits of the Galilei group play a central r\^ole in their
description. We thereby provide a nontrivial physical interpretation of these
orbits. We further construct classical and quantum dipoles as bound states of
monopoles, where the restricted planar motion arises from a novel mixed
Carroll-Galilei symmetry. We also argue that the simplest and already
experimentally realised systems with Carroll symmetry are in crystals.

*V. Niarchos,C. Papageorgakis,A. Stratoudakis,M. Woolley*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method for solving bootstrap equations in CFTs, applying it to finite-temperature theories on a specific space. It avoids common issues with positivity and truncations, instead using functions to model infinite operators numerically without needing too much data. The method relies on the KMS condition, thermal dispersion relations, and neural networks to model spin effects. It's tested on free fields and used to analyze thermal data in holographic CFTs. The method shows results comparable to known thermal correlators and suggests its potential for future applications in more complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conformal field theories are important in theoretical physics, especially at finite temperatures. The paper addresses the challenge of Bootstrap equations, which are crucial for understanding CFTs, by introducing a novel approach. This could lead to better understanding of thermal CFTs and their applications in String Theory or Holography.

Method: The new method avoids positivity constraints and truncation errors by modeling infinite operators with functions, using the KMS condition, thermal dispersion, and neural networks to model spin-dependent tails. It combines numerical bootstrap with these tools to capture operator contributions effectively.

Result: The method successfully models finite-temperature theories and tested well on free fields, helping analyze double-twist thermal data in holographic CFTs with results matching known Thermal Correlators.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising framework for resolving Bootstrap equations in CFTs, particularly at finite temperatures, using neural networks and thermal data, enabling accurate computations with less input data than traditional methods.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method to bootstrap crossing equations in Conformal
Field Theory and apply it to finite temperature theories on $S^1\times
\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. The proposed approach does not rely on positivity
constraints and does not employ uncontrolled truncation schemes. Instead, we
capture the contribution of an infinite number of operators in conformal block
expansions using suitable functions, which are bootstrapped (numerically)
together with a finite number of exposed CFT data. Our approach at finite
temperature employs three key ingredients: $(i)$ the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger
(KMS) condition, $(ii)$ thermal dispersion relations and $(iii)$ Neural
Networks that model spin-dependent tail functions within the conformal block
expansions. We test the efficiency of the new method in the case of Generalized
Free Fields and use it to perform a preliminary bootstrap analysis of
double-twist thermal data in holographic CFTs.

*Yoshiki Fukusumi,Shinichiro Yahagi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for extending conformal field theories by realizing simple current extensions. It systematically constructs fusion rings for bulk and chiral theories, and obtains modular partition functions with specific symmetries. The bulk fusion rings are crucial for conformal bootstrap, while the chiral rings provide data for topological quantum field theories. The paper also extends this method to more complex systems, using folding tricks for domain walls and massless flows. It opens new research directions by connecting algebraic methods with conformal field theory and topological orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of conformal field theories (CFTs) and their extensions is a cornerstone in modern theoretical physics, particularly in string theory and critical phenomena. Understanding how to extend a CFT using simple currents opens new possibilities for constructing more realistic models and exploring their properties. This paper likely provides a systematic approach that could unify various extensions and enhance the mathematical tools available to researchers in this field.

Method: The paper likely introduces a method involving abstract algebra, specifically group theory and fusion rings, to systematically extend CFTs. By constructing $Z_N$ symmetry extended fusion rings and modular partition functions, the authors probably leverage algebraic structures to maintain consistency and compute physical observables. The mention of nonanomalous subgroups suggests they address anomalies that can arise in these extensions, possibly by restricting to subgroups where anomalies cancel out.

Result: The key results include the construction of equipped fusion rings and partition functions, which serve as algebraic data structures for understanding the extended CFTs. The bulk and chiral rings provide different aspects: the bulk ring is essential for conformal bootstrap methods, which aim to determine CFTs by their algebraic properties, while the chiral ring is more relevant for topological quantum field theories, which are intrinsically linked to the boundary conditions of these extended systems. Additionally, the paper likely extends this method to multicomponent systems, broadening its applicability beyond simple cases. The use of folding tricks in obtaining partition functions for domain walls and massless flows indicates successful techniques for handling transitions between different phases or structures within the same theory.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive framework for extending conformal field theories using algebraic methods, likely offering a systematic approach to constructing extensions with specific symmetries and modular properties. It paves the way for new classification programs in CFTs and their applications in topological quantum field theories and condensed matter physics. The introduction of systematic algebraic tools could significantly enhance future research in these areas, providing a robust foundation for both theoretical explorations and potential practical applications in related fields.

Abstract: We introduce a general method for realizing simple current extensions of the
conformal field theories. We systematically obtain the $Z_{N}$ symmetry
extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular
partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The bulk
(or nonchiral) fusion ring provides fundamental algebraic data for conformal
bootstrap, and the chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the graded
symmetry topological field theories. The latter also provides algebraic data of
smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended
models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a
new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick to the resultant
coupled theories, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped
domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group
structures. This work opens new research directions in studying the
classification of conformal field theories and the corresponding topological
quantum field theories (or topological orders) by establishing the traditional
methods in abstract algebra and modular form.

Abstract: The uniqueness and rigidity of black holes remain central themes in
gravitational research. In this work, we investigate the construction of all
extremal black hole solutions to the Einstein equation for a given near-horizon
geometry, employing the homotopy algebraic perspective, a powerful and
increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory.
Utilising Gau{\ss}ian null coordinates, we recast the deformation problem as an
analysis of the homotopy Maurer-Cartan equation associated with an
$L_\infty$-algebra. Through homological perturbation theory, we systematically
solve this equation order by order in directions transverse to the near-horizon
geometry. As a concrete application of this formalism, we examine the
deformations of the extremal Kerr horizon. Notably, this homotopy-theoretic
approach enables us to characterise the moduli space of deformations by
studying only the lowest-order solutions, offering a systematic way to
understand the landscape of extremal black hole geometries.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent Ge hole spin qubit experiments, we construct and
study a two-leg spin ladder from a quantum dot array with spin-orbit couplings
(SOCs), aiming to uncover the many-body phase diagrams and provide concrete
guidance for the Ge hole spin qubit experiments. The spin ladder is described
by an unprecedented, complex spin Hamiltonian, which contains antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), and anisotropic exchange
interactions. We analyze the spin ladder Hamiltonian in two complementary
situations, the strong rung coupling limit and the weak rung coupling limit. In
the strong rung coupling limit, we systematically construct effective spin-1/2
chain models, connecting the well-studied one-dimensional spin models and
providing a recipe for Hamiltonian engineering. It is worth emphasizing that
effective DM interactions can be completely turned off while the microscopic DM
interactions are generically inevitable. Moreover, the staggered DM
interactions, which are not possible in the microscopic spin model, can also be
realized in the effective spin-1/2 model. In the weak rung coupling limit, we
employ Abelian bosonization and Luther-Emery fermionization, uncovering a
multitude of phases. Several commensurate-incommensurate transitions are driven
by both the longitudinal magnetic field and the DM interactions in the legs
(chains). Remarkably, the low-energy phase diagrams show strong dependence in
the DM interaction, providing a concrete way to identify the strength of SOC in
the experiments. Our work bridges quantum many-body theory and spin qubit
device physics, establishing spin ladders made of spin-orbit-coupled quantum
dots as a promising platform for engineering exotic spin models, constructing
quantum many-body states, and enabling programmable quantum computations.

### [97] [Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08376)
*Qi Zhang,Wen-Tao Xu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the phase transition between the toric code and double semion phases, suggesting it's a continuous XY-type transition mediated by a Z4 quantum double model. They use Wilson loop indicators to confirm deconfined Z4 anyons during the phase transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing issue of whether a direct continuous transition exists between these topological phases, which hasn't been resolved by previous studies. The authors propose that by considering a Z4 quantum double model, they can better understand the transition mechanism.

Method: The method involves introducing a perturbed Z4 quantum double model to study the transition. They map the transition to a two-coupled quantum Ising model and utilize condensation order parameters and Wilson loop area law coefficients to analyze the behavior of Z4 anyons.

Result: Through their analysis, they confirm the existence of a continuous (2+1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases and demonstrate that Z4 anyons deconfine during this transition, bridging the gap between Z2 topological orders.

Conclusion: This work provides a new theoretical framework for understanding topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation, particularly useful for exploring transitions between distinct Z2 topological orders.

Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly
understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and
double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological
orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them
can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a
directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem.
Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct
anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We
confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC
and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly,
using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the
Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from
the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition
between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path
toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions
beyond anyon condensation.

### [98] [Nagaoka Instability and Quantum Phase Transition via Kinetic Frustration Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08410)
*Prakash Sharma,Yang Peng,Donna N. Sheng,Hitesh J. Changlani,Yao Wang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the ferromagnetic instability in the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) model using a combination of theoretical approaches and numerical simulations. They find that frustration caused by the hopping parameter t’ leads to the formation of different magnetic states, including spin-polarons and spiral spin-density waves, especially at low but finite hole densities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems under varying lattice geometries is crucial for explaining phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity. This paper contributes by studying the effects of kinetic frustration, which is a key factor in determining the magnetic properties of such systems.

Method: The authors employ a theoretical approach using an analytic method, DMRG simulations, and a variational analysis. The DMRG is applied to large systems to study phase transitions and identify different magnetic phases.

Result: Analytically, they predict the critical value of t’/t for instability and use DMRG to confirm the transition from NT ferromagnet to spiral spin-density wave and then to antiferromagnet. The study shows the robustness of these transitions at low hole densities, making the phases observable in real experiments with cold atoms and moiré lattices.

Conclusion: Their findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the NT instability under kinetic frustration and demonstrate the feasibility of observing these magnetic phases in experimental systems using strong interactions and tunable geometry.

Abstract: We investigate the Nagaoka-Thouless (NT) ferromagnetic instability in the
strongly interacting $t$-$t'$ Hubbard model by continuously breaking
particle-hole symmetry on a tunable square-triangular lattice geometry. We use
an analytic approach to show that the fully spin-polarized state becomes
unstable to a metastable spin-polaron when the kinetic frustration $t'/t$
exceeds a critical, dimension-dependent value. Large-scale density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal a quantum phase transition from
the NT ferromagnet to a spiral spin-density wave, which evolves continuously
into the Haerter-Shastry antiferromagnet in the large-frustration limit.
Remarkably, this transition remains robust at low but finite hole density,
making it accessible in cold-atom and moir\'e Hubbard platforms under strong
interactions. A variational analysis further captures the instability mechanism
at finite density via frustration-induced magnon band deformation.

Abstract: We design a lattice model of non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions
with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model
realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) which has been
argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac
spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets. At finite flavor chemical
potential, corresponding to a Zeeman field perturbing the Dirac spin liquid, we
find a ''chiral flux'' phase which is characterized by the generation of a
finite mean emergent gauge flux and, accordingly, the formation of relativistic
Landau levels for the Dirac fermions. In this state, the U(1)$_m$ magnetic
symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to a gapless free photon mode which,
due to spin-flux-attachment, is observable in the longitudinal spin structure
factor. We numerically compute longitudinal and transverse spin structure
factors which match our continuum and lattice mean-field theory predictions.
Further, sufficiently strong fluctuations of the emergent gauge field give rise
to an antiferromagnetically ordered state with gapped Dirac fermions coexisting
with a deconfined gauge field. We also find an interesting intermediate phase
where the chiral flux phase and the antiferromagnetic phase coexist. We argue
that our results pave the way to testable predictions for magnetized Dirac spin
liquids in frustrated quantum antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Correlated kagome metals host unique electronic states that enable exotic
quantum phenomena. In the recently emerged CsCr6Sb6, these manifest through
Kondo behavior from localized Cr-3d electrons and unprecedented band flattening
near the Fermi level. Yet the intricate interplay among Kondo screening,
magnetic frustration, and electronic correlations remains poorly understood-a
fundamental gap we address through multifaceted experimental and theoretical
approaches. Our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal
electronic correlation-renormalized flat bands and muon spin relaxation study
detect short-range magnetic order at TN ~ 80 K. Complementing these findings,
density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations identify
a coherent-incoherent crossover at TN, with a remarkable restoration of
coherence accompanying local moment suppression-an anomalous hallmark of Kondo
behavior. Intriguingly, despite strong interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling,
the system evades long-range magnetic order due to competing magnetic
configurations separated by sub-meV energy differences. These insights
establish CsCr6Sb6 as a prototypical platform for investigating dynamical Kondo
screening in correlated flat-band systems, opening new avenues to study flat
band physics and frustrated magnetism in correlated kagome lattices.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses topological quasiparticles in half-Heusler materials, focusing on hole carrier formation through correlated electrons in YPtBi and GdPtBi using GW and DFT methods, revealing temperature effects on chemical potential and band structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of hole carriers in topological materials is crucial for quantum device applications, prompting this study using advanced quantum methods to understand their formation and behavior.

Method: The research employs ab initio GW theory combined with DFT to investigate the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi, analyzing the effects of correlated 4d and 4f electrons on band structure and hole carrier formation.

Result: The study finds that in YPtBi, Y-4d electrons create topological bands with Fermi level at high temps, and correlations at low temps cause hole pockets. GdPtBi shows Hubbard-like bands from 4f electrons with pronounced hole bands due to hybridization and Lifshitz transitions at low temps.

Conclusion: Integration of correlated fermions in topological semimetals modulates band topology, providing a pathway to control hole bands for quantum device applications.

Abstract: Topological quasiparticles, arising when the chemical potential is near the
band crossing, are pivotal for the development of next-generation quantum
devices. They are expected to exist in half-Heusler correlated topological
semimetals. However, the emergence of hole carriers, which alter the chemical
potential away from the quadratic-band-touching points is not yet understood.
Here, we investigated the electronic structure of YPtBi and GdPtBi through ab
initio many-body perturbation GW theory combined with dynamical mean-field
theory and revealed that the correlation effects of 4$d$ or 4$f$ electrons can
lead to the formation of hole carriers. In YPtBi, the weakly correlated Y-4$d$
electrons constitute the topological bands, and the quadratic-band-touching
point is at the Fermi level at high temperatures. At low temperatures, enhanced
correlations of Y-4$d$ renormalize the topological bands, leading to the
formation of hole pocket. In GdPtBi, the strongly correlated Gd-4$f$ electrons
form the Hubbard-like bands originate from self-energy effects associated with
a topological singularity. These local bands encompass itinerant 4$f$ bands,
which hybridize with topological bands to induce pronounced hole bands. This
concerted effect reduces the hole doping, bringing the chemical potential
closer to the quadratic-band-touching points as the temperature is lowered. The
temperature-induced Lifshitz transition should be responsible for the large
hole bands observed in both topological semimetals in angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements at low temperatures. Our findings
indicate that the integration of correlated fermions within a topological
framework can modulate the energy landscape of topological bands.

Abstract: We herein report the successful intercalation of water molecules into the
layered honeycomb lattice of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, a Kitaev-candidate compound,
to obtain the hydrated phase Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$$\cdot$$y$H$_2$O ($y \sim$
2.4). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis,
differential scanning calorimetry, and Rietveld refinements indicate that
crystalline water resides between the cobalt-based honeycomb layers. This
insertion of neutral molecules significantly alters the crystal structure,
increasing the interlayer spacing and modifying the local bonding environment.
Magnetization measurements reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_N \sim
17.2$ K, accompanied by a discernible weak ferromagnetic component. The
application of moderate magnetic fields induces a spin-flop reorientation at
$\mu_0H \sim 5.7$ T. The $\lambda$-type anomaly and long-range order persist up
to 9 T, showing the reconfiguration of the ground state as opposed to its
suppression. Heat-capacity analysis reveals the full $2R\ln2$ magnetic entropy
expected for two $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ moments per formula unit, confirming the
pseudospin description. These findings demonstrate that water intercalation is
a robust strategy for tuning the magnetic properties of honeycomb lattice
materials. Overall, this study highlights neutral-molecule insertion as a
promising route toward the discovery and engineering of quantum magnets based
on layered transition metal oxides.

Abstract: Unlike conventional magnetic states, which lack degeneracy, the spiral spin
liquid (SSL) fluctuates among degenerate spiral configurations, with
ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal
space. At low temperatures, the field-induced crossover from the polarized
ferromagnetic state to the SSL results in a large entropy increase and
decalescence, indicating its potential for magnetic cooling. However, magnetic
cooling using a SSL has yet to be reported. Here, we investigate the
magnetocaloric effect and cooling performance of single-crystal GdZnPO, a
spin-7/2 honeycomb-lattice SSL candidate, under a magnetic field $H$ $<$
$H_\mathrm{c}$ ($\mu_0H_\mathrm{c}$ $\sim$ 12 T) applied perpendicular to the
honeycomb plane and below the crossover temperature ($\sim$2 K). For $H$ $\geq$
$H_\mathrm{c}$, GdZnPO enters a polarized non-degenerate ferromagnetic state.
Our results demonstrate that GdZnPO exhibits a giant low-temperature
magnetocaloric effect near $H_\mathrm{c}$, surpassing other magnetocaloric
materials. This giant magnetocaloric effect is well-explained by the frustrated
honeycomb spin model of GdZnPO, suggesting the stability of the SSL below
$H_\mathrm{c}$ down to very low temperatures. Additionally, its magnetic
cooling performance remains robust up to at least 4.5 K, making GdZnPO a
promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration down to $\sim$36 mK through
cycling the applied magnetic field within a narrow range.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of magnons in thermal conductivity, identifying itinerant antiferromagnetic BaMn2Bi2 as a key material, using Boltzmann transport formalism to analyze contributions from electrons, phonons, and magnons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of magnons in thermal transport is crucial for the development of materials that can enhance heat dissipation in electronics and thermoelectric devices.

Method: The authors use the Boltzmann transport formalism to analyze thermal conductivity contributions from electrons, phonons, and magnons in itinerant AFM BaMn2Bi2.

Result: The study reveals the direct and indirect contributions of electrons, phonons, and magnons to thermal conductivity, as well as their interactions. The magneto-thermal, magneto-electrical, and magneto-Seebeck effects are analyzed, providing unique insights into magnon involvement in thermal phenomena.

Conclusion: The research establishes BaMn2Bi2 as a promising material for thermoelectric applications, highlighting the importance of considering magnon contributions alongside electrons and phonons in thermal transport analysis.

Abstract: Thermal transport, generally mediated by the direct microscopic exchange of
kinetic energy via lattice phonons, can also be modified by contributions from
additional quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons. However, a
comprehensive understanding of the magnon influence has yet to be realized and
remains an active research area. The most significant roadblock has been a lack
of available materials in which these three quasiparticles can be clearly
identified and quantitatively examined in order to provide an intrinsic
understanding, not only of their independent contributions to thermal
conductivity but also of the cross-correlated interactions among them.
Itinerant antiferromagnetic (AFM) BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ with PT symmetry exhibits
Anderson metal-insulator localization, which can be tuned into the metallic
regime via an applied magnetic field due to its unique electron-magnon
interactions. We identify itinerant AFM BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$ as an ideal material
for scientific investigations into how these quasiparticles participate in
thermal conductivity. Here, we present the direct contribution of electrons,
phonons, and magnons to thermal conductivity, as well as their interspecies
interactions, supported by detailed analyses conducted in the framework of the
Boltzmann transport formalism. The comparison of the magneto-thermal
conductivity and magneto-electrical conductivity, as well as the
magneto-Seebeck effect of itinerant antiferromagnetic BaMn$_{2}$Bi$_{2}$, gives
unique insight into how magnons participate in longitudinal thermal-associated
phenomena.
