Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the\nbubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black\nhole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble\nsurrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the\ntwo constituents.", "AI": {"tldr": " paper presents a solution for multiple Kerr black holes in expanding bubble. Study their properties and equilibrium. Realistic for parallel galaxies. Publishable for general relativity.", "motivation": "Investigating black hole configurations in cosmological settings could provide insights into galaxy evolution and large-scale structure.", "method": "Inverse scattering technique used to build solution for collinear black holes in expanding bubble. Analytical methods to study thermodynamics and equilibrium configurations.", "result": "Solution exists with multiple Kerr black holes. Black holes maintain realistic properties. Binary system achieves equilibrium when surrounded by expanding bubble.", "conclusion": " offers analytical model for multiple black holes in expanding universe, useful for theoretical studies, publication in GR journal. Could explain galaxy structures and gravitational waves."}}
