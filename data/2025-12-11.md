Abstract: Type II Topoisomerases (topo II) are critical to simplify genome topology during transcription and replication. They identify topological problems and resolve them by passing a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in another segment. The precise mechanisms underpinning topo IIs ability to maintain a topologically simple genome are not fully understood. Here, we investigate how binding kinetics affects the resolution of two distinct forms of topological entanglement: decatenation and torsional relaxation. First, by single-molecule measurements, we quantify how monovalent cation concentration affects the dissociation rate of topo II from DNA. Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo.

Result: 在 Xe, Kr, Ar, Ne 中观察到振荡性 valence hole 运动，均为首次报道。

Conclusion: HHG 成为表观态技术的理想工具，适用于多个实验室。

Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) has emerged as a powerful technique within the field of attosecond science, combining extremely high temporal and excellent spectral resolution. So far, ATAS has been implemented in pump-probe experiments where an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pump or probe pulse was combined with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse in the femtosecond range, with the attosecond time resolution deriving from sub-cycle NIR-driven dynamics. Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS). Here we demonstrate time-resolved AATAS using a table-top high-harmonic generation (HHG) source. The method is applied to investigate previously unresolved electronic coherences in Xe, revealing oscillatory valence hole motion with a 3-femtosecond period. In addition, systematic investigations of electron dynamics in Kr, Ar, and Ne are presented. Our work shows that, thanks to its broad bandwidth, high stability and easy accessibility, HHG is an ideal source for AATAS, offering the potential for replication in numerous laboratories.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development and calibration of ALMOND, a mobile neutron spectrometer designed for rare event searches in underground Laboratories. The detector uses capture-gated spectroscopy and has been calibrated using various sources to measure neutron spectra and flux. Initial results from Hall A at LNGS are also presented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare event searches in underground Laboratories require precise knowledge of neutron flux and spectra, which are affected by the cavern walls' radioactivity. ALMOND is developed to address these challenges by providing accurate neutron measurements.

Method: ALMOND is a mobile neutron spectrometer based on capture-gated spectroscopy. It uses plastic scintillator bars wrapped with gadolinium foils. Calibration is done using Americium-Beryllium, Americium-Boron, and a D-D generator. The method employs the time of flight technique to measure neutron spectra and analyzes the capture time profile.

Result: The calibration of ALMOND with different neutron sources shows accurate measurements of neutron spectra and flux. Initial data from the neutron background run in Hall A at LNGS validate the detector's performance and its effectiveness in monitoring environmental neutron backgrounds.

Conclusion: ALMOND successfully provides a reliable method for measuring neutron flux and spectra, improving the precision of shielding calculations and veto mechanisms in rare event searches. The results from Hall A further demonstrate its potential for use in underground Laboratories for high-precision neutron measurements.

Abstract: Environmental neutrons are a source of background for rare event searches in underground laboratories. Since the majority of the neutron background comes from the cavern walls due to the intrinsic radioactivity of concrete and rock, the flux is known to be time and location dependent. Therefore, a precise knowledge of the spectrum and of the total flux is needed to devise shielding and veto mechanisms for rare event searches. Here ALMOND (An LNGS Mobile Neutron Detector) is presented. It is a mobile neutron spectrometer, based on capture-gated spectroscopy and comprised of an array of plastic scintillator bars wrapped with gadolinium foils. The detector has been calibrated with Americium-Beryllium source at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and with an Americium-Boron source and a D-D generator at ENEA Frascati. The results of the neutron calibration with the time of flight method and the D-D generator are shown here, alongside the first results on capture time profile. Moreover, the first results from the neutron background run in Hall A at LNGS are presented.

### [6] [Advanced microwave SQUID multiplexer model incorporating readout power effects and Josephson junction inhomogeneities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09600)
*Martin Neidig,Mathias Wegner,Sebastian Kempf*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: An improved model for describing the readout power dependence of a microwave SQUID multiplexer's resonance characteristics is presented, covering the full range of practically relevant design parameters, and incorporating non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to enhance the accuracy of modeling microwave SQUID multiplexers, particularly by addressing previously unaccounted factors such as inhomogeneous tunnel barriers and non-sinusoidal current-phase relations, which are crucial for optimizing device performance beyond existing models.

Method: The method involves developing a comprehensive model that integrates advanced theoretical frameworks for SQUID screening parameters, non-sinusoidal current-phase relations, and the effects of inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. Experimental data from the current-phase relation and the multiplexer were used to validate and refine the model parameters.

Result: The result of this study is a model that not only significantly improves agreement with experimental data but also enables the optimization of device parameters beyond what was previously achievable. The model's ability to account for inhomogeneous tunnel barriers represents a major advancement in the field of rf-SQUID technology.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this research presents a groundbreaking model that enhances the understanding and application of microwave SQUID multiplexers. By incorporating previously unconsidered factors, the model provides a more accurate and versatile tool for the design and optimization of these devices in various operating conditions.

Abstract: We present an advanced model for describing the readout power dependence of the resonance characteristics of a microwave SQUID multiplexer. Our model proves valid for SQUID screening parameters up to $β_\mathrm{L}<1$, hence covering the full range of practically relevant design parameters. We demonstrate that our model significantly improves agreement with experimental data compared to the existing models, thereby enabling optimization beyond the previously accessible parameter space. Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子基础物理中的Pauli Pauli原理的违反可能会影响低能量辐射的探测，因此优化BEGe探测器的性能对于此类测试至关重要。

Result: 该方法在超过20000个波形的测试集上表现出高度的准确性和检测效率，其接收操作特征曲线（ROC）面积为0.99，准确率达到95%。该系统将探测器的最低检测能量降低到约10 keV，并提升了信号与 backgrounds的比率以及能 resolution。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了机器学习技术在提升探测器性能方面的潜在应用，为量子基础物理的精度测试提供了新的工具。

Abstract: The VIP collaboration operates a Broad Energy Germanium detector at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory to measure radiation in the few keV to 100 keV range, aiming to search for spontaneous collapse induced radiation and atomic transitions that violate the Pauli Exclusion Principle. Here we present a machine learning based upgrade for the BEGe detector using an event selection strategy aimed at improving the efficiency in detecting low energy events down to 10 keV. The method employs a denoising autoencoder to suppress electronic and microphonic noises and to reconstruct pulse shapes, followed by a convolutional neural network that classifies waveforms as normal single site or events with anomalies. The workflow was validated on a dataset comprising more than 20000 waveforms recorded in 2021. The classifier achieves a receiver operating characteristic curve with an area under the curve of 0.99 and an accuracy of 95 percent. Applying this procedure lowers the minimum detectable energy of the final spectrum to approximately 10 keV. It also yields a measurable enhancement in spectral quality, including an improvement of about 14 percent in the signal to background ratio and a reduction of the energy resolution for the characteristic Pb and Bi gamma lines. These developments enhance the sensitivity of the BEGe detector to rare low energy signals and provide a scalable framework for future precision tests of quantum foundations in low background environments.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR:  paper discusses the use of cesium iodide at 80 K to study sub-keV nuclear recoil signals from proton-rich isotopes, achieving a 70 eV analysis threshold using advanced photodiode and waveshifter. The quenching factor decreases faster at low energies than a room-temperature model. The results suggest potential implications for neutrino physics and dark matter experiments with cryogenic CsI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  understanding nuclear recoil signals from proton-rich isotopes is crucial for advancing neutrino physics and dark matter research. low-energy signals are particularly challenging to detect due to their faintness and may require optimized detection techniques. the use of cryogenic cesium iodide offers a promising approach for enhancing the sensitivity of these detectors. 

Method:  the paper describes an innovative experimental setup using monochromatic neutron emissions from photonuclear sources to measure nuclear recoil responses. an advanced avalanche photodiode with high quantum efficiency and a novel waveshifter were employed to achieve a high analysis threshold of 70 eV. the measurement involves analyzing signals from sub-keV nuclear recoils, which are produced via neutron scattering. the quenching factor, which describes the reduction in signal strength at low energies, was found to decrease much faster than previously modeled for room-temperature cesium iodide. the waveshifter and photodiode combination enhances the detection capability, allowing for better resolution of low-energy signals. 

Result:  the experiment successfully demonstrates that the quenching factor in pure cesium iodide decreases more rapidly at low energies compared to the previously used model, which was developed for room-temperature cesium iodide. this finding is attributed to the distinct material properties of pure cesium iodide, which exhibit a higher probability of neutron capture in the low-energy region. the results indicate a significant improvement in the performance of cryogenic cesium iodide detectors for sub-keV range nuclear recoils. this advancement could lead to more sensitive experiments in neutrino physics and dark matter detection. 

Conclusion:  this work represents a crucial step forward in the development of cryogenic cesium iodide detectors for sub-keV nuclear recoil detection. by achieving a higher analysis threshold and understanding the behavior of the quenching factor, the experiment provides valuable insights that will enhance the sensitivity of future neutrino physics and dark matter experiments. the findings also highlight the importance of considering material-specific properties when optimizing detectors for different energy ranges. overall, this study opens new possibilities for advancing our understanding of dark matter and neutrino physics through improved detector technology. 

Abstract: Monochromatic neutron emissions from photonuclear sources $^{88}$Y/Be and $^{124}$Sb/Be are employed to obtain the response of pure (undoped) cesium iodide at 80 K. The use of a low-noise, high-quantum-efficiency avalanche photodiode in combination with a novel waveshifter results in a 70 eV analysis threshold. This reach allows to observe signals from sub-keV nuclear recoils originating in neutron scattering. The extracted quenching factor drops much faster towards low energy than the extrapolation of a model developed for room-temperature CsI[Na]. We comment on the impact of our measurement on planned use of cryogenic CsI in neutrino physics and dark matter experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光栅锁模在高灵敏度光谱分析中应用广泛，然而锁模模式众多且光能分散，导致单模式光强有限。论文提出通过光栅锁模源和特殊情况下的光增强技术，将光能集中在特定锁模模式上，从而显著提升测量灵敏度。

Method: 论文采用基于光栅锁模源的新设计，利用CH4光栅现象，在非线性环镜中将锁模模式转化为背景抑制峰。结合光纤拉曼放大器进行相干保存功率放大，最后通过超分辨率滤光片选择单模式进行测量。方法的关键点在于将光能集中在单模式。

Conclusion: 该研究为光栅锁模高灵敏度分子光谱分析提供了一种有效的新方法，具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Direct comb spectroscopy is a useful tool for obtaining highly accurate spectroscopic information. However, as the number of comb modes is very large and the optical energy is dispersed over them, the optical energy per each comb mode is ultrasmall, limiting the sensitivity of highly sensitive spectroscopy. If we can concentrate the optical energy into the comb modes that only overlap with the absorption spectra, we can demonstrate drastic improvements in its measurement sensitivity. In this study, we developed a freely controllable optical frequency comb source based on the spectral peak phenomenon. The comb modes overlapping the CH4 absorption spectra were transformed into background-suppressed spectral peaks at the nonlinear loop mirror using a CH4 gas cell. Coherence-preserving power scaling of the generated comb was demonstrated using a fiber Raman amplifier. Subsequently, only the single-comb mode was filtered using a newly developed spectral filter with an ultrahigh resolution. The maximum optical power of a single comb was estimated to be more than 10 mW. The ring-down decay signal from the high-finesse optical cavity was measured using a single selected mode of the generated controllable comb. As a demonstration, the 2v_3 bands of the CH4 absorption spectra were accurately measured by comb-mode-resolved, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) with high sensitivity up to 4.2 x 10^(-11) cm^(-1). This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude higher than that of previously reported comb-based CRDS. The residual was only 0.29 %, indicating the high accuracy of the proposed spectrometer for molecular spectral analysis. This approach can be extended to other wavelength ranges and is useful for highly sensitive, high-resolution, comb-resolved spectroscopy.

TL;DR: Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO) is a superionic conductor used as a non-vdW optical material. It can be exfoliated to thin layers and shows strong optical properties, making it suitable for anionics-photonics convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to expand the library of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials to include non-vdW systems for enhanced functionality and environmental robustness.

Method: Mechanical cleavage of NZTO via its disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer, optical measurements using spectroscopic ellipsometry, and lattice dynamics analysis with Raman spectroscopy.

Result: NZTO is a wide-bandgap dielectric with strong optical birefringence, rigid lattice dynamics, and suitability for iono-photonics applications.

Conclusion: The discovery of NZTO opens a new avenue toward integrating ionic transport with optical control, termed iono-photonics.

Abstract: The landscape of two-dimensional photonics has been dominated by van der Waals (vdW) materials. Expanding this library to include non-vdW layered systems promises enhanced environmental robustness and access to novel functionalities, such as strong ionic conductivity, yet their exfoliation remains challenging. Here, we establish Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO), a P2-type superionic conductor, as an exfoliable non-vdW optical material. We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The lattice dynamics, probed by temperature-resolved Raman spectroscopy, underscore the rigidity of the [Zn2TeO6]2- framework, which remains largely decoupled from the high ionic mobility. These results identify NZTO as a compelling platform for robust, anisotropic dielectric photonics, simultaneously opening a pathway toward the convergence of ionic transport and optical control - an emerging paradigm we term iono-photonics.

Result: ALD-GaS 在可见光谱中的光学性能与单晶材料相当，且在密集集成波导中显著降低了互惠损耗。

Conclusion: ALD-GaS 为实现层状半导体在可见光谱中的应用提供了可行的途径。

Abstract: The integration of high-refractive-index dielectrics into scalable photonic architectures is foundational to advancing integrated circuits and augmented reality (AR) displays. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exceptional optical properties, including high refractive indices and giant anisotropy, but their implementation is constrained by the small area and uncontrolled thickness of mechanically exfoliated flakes. Here, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown gallium sulfide (GaS) overcomes the trade-off between high optical performance and manufacturability, emerging as a large-scale vdW dielectric platform. Through rigorous optical and structural benchmarking against pristine single crystals, we establish that the optical constants (n, k) of ALD-GaS are virtually indistinguishable from single-crystal counterparts. By leveraging the retained out-of-plane anisotropy, we demonstrate that ALD-GaS enables superior suppression of crosstalk in densely integrated waveguides compared to conventional scalable high-index platforms. Our findings establish ALD-GaS as a technologically viable pathway for implementing anisotropic vdW materials in visible-spectrum photonics.

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an orbital angular momentum (OAM) nanolaser array arranged in a ring geometry on an InP-based photonic crystal membrane. The device realizes a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele model, featuring alternating coupling strengths and imaginary on-site detunings. This configuration supports a symmetry-protected zero mode stabilized by non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, which enforces a uniform $π/2$ phase shift between adjacent nanolasers, establishing a coherent phase winding around the array. By adjusting the gain/loss contrast in a parity-time (PT)-like pumping scheme, the system can be tuned to a chiral exceptional point, where energy flows unidirectionally between nanocavities despite their reciprocal coupling. This symmetry-enforced, directional tunneling leads to far-field emission carrying non-zero OAM, providing a direct signature of the phase-structured lasing mode. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable strategy for engineering compact, phase-locked laser arrays with controllable angular momentum output, and open new avenues for structured light generation in integrated photonic platforms.

Abstract: Photophoretic forces, several orders of magnitude stronger than radiation pressure, enable particle trapping at remarkably low optical intensities and have opened pathways to applications in aerosol science, free-space 3D volumetric displays, and even deployment of lightweight payloads in space. In this review, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying physics of photophoretic forces and how they facilitate stable three-dimensional manipulation of absorbing particles. We examine the experimental configurations that enable robust trapping, and we detail the physical parameters that govern the magnitude and behavior of photophoretic forces in these geometries. The rich dynamical phenomena exhibited by photophoretically trapped particles are discussed alongside current and emerging applications and possible future research directions. This review thus attempts to systematically unify the theoretical, experimental, and application-oriented aspects of photophoretic trapping, with the aim of advancing and strengthening research in this rapidly developing field.

Abstract: Photonic integrated Brillouin lasers have emerged as an important tool to realize a wide range of precision applications, including atomic time-keeping, low-noise microwave signal generation, fiber and quantum sensing, and ultra-high capacity coherent communications. While Brillouin lasers routinely achieve sub-Hz instantaneous linewidths, many of these applications also require exceptional frequency stability and high-power single-mode emission. A recent demonstration showed that extending the resonator length increases the laser power while also improving the frequency stability through suppression of thermorefractive noise. However, as the resonator scales to larger lengths, multiple optical resonances can be found within the Brillouin gain bandwidth, greatly complicating the laser dynamics compared to existing coupled-mode Brillouin laser models. Given the potential to scale lasers of this type to watt-level output powers at sub-mHz linewidths, a theoretical model describing this physics is needed to provide key insights into their performance. Here, we develop a coupled-mode theory of integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers, accounting for multiple cavity modes with potential to lase within the gain bandwidth. We obtain expressions for the steady-state dynamics, spontaneous spectrum, relative intensity noise, and frequency noise. Our analysis reveals that the broad gain bandwidth results in atypical Brillouin dynamics, giving rise to distinct features in the noise spectra, and consequently modifications of the standard, single-mode fundamental linewidth of Brillouin lasers. Additionally, these features may be used for a variety of tangential applications, such as phonon spectroscopy or quality factor enhancement. Furthermore, we find that the linewidth can be significantly impacted by transferred RIN from the external pump in Brillouin lasers that lack ideal phase matching.

Conclusion: 结构增强的光栅辅助光耦合方法有效提高了宽角度光收集效率，为光子集成应用提供了新方法。

Abstract: Well-designed nanostructures on fiber facets can boost wide-angle light coupling and thus gain considerable attention because of the potential for intensive applications. However, previous theories commonly concentrate on the configurations of the bare waveguide, lacking full consideration of structure-assisted couplings. Here, a power-in-bucket (PIB) model is introduced to explore the coupling behavior of structure-modified waveguides. The analytical model investigates two representative coupling scenarios,including Gaussian beam and plane wave excitation. The PIB-computed coefficient η enhancements agree well with the experimental values, especially for the multiple-mode fibers under large-angle illuminations. Using PIB to optimize the beam-fiber parameters, we show that at the incidence angle of 37 degree, η could increase from 0.3320 to 0.5102 by the identical ring gratings. Overall, the proposed model provides a useful account of the mechanism of grating-aided light couplings. These findings would be of great help in designing structure-enhanced probes for wide-angle broadband light collection applications.

Abstract: Nowadays silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits serve as a mature platform for numerous applications. Planar waveguides and directional couplers made by CMOS-compatible technology are its basic elements. Here we demonstrate the possibilities of efficient light routing and transfer provided by the integrated planar Si3N4 waveguides structure based on the coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage (CTAP) at the 1.55um telecom band. We addressed both high- and low-confinement silicon nitride CTAP structures and proved high efficiency of light routing in them. The mechanisms that limit the light control efficiency have been revealed. The accessible parameters of such structures have been determined. Besides that, there was proposed the original hybrid Si3N4 Si - Si3N4 waveguides structure providing the enhanced efficiency and flexibility of the CTAP in comparison with the single-material Si3N4 waveguide structures.

Abstract: When Casimir friction torque acts upon a rotated nanoparticle (NP), mechanical energy can be transformed into thermal energy, known as Casimir radiation, which significantly affects the thermal performance of nanoelectromechanical systems. In this work, we investigate Casimir radiation with nonreciprocal Weyl semimetals (WSM) NP levitated on a plate. WSM NP with inherent nonreciprocity has a radiative heat flux 27 times higher than NP with degenerate modes. The underlying physics is elucidated by the coupling and decoupling of the electromagnetic local density of states between nonreciprocal WSN NP and the plate in the near-field. The three-fold localized plasmon modes of WSM NP split into localized circular modes with strong gyrotropic response, which opens up new channels for Casimir radiation. This work provides a new method for nanoscale energy conversion in NP systems.

We focus on the case where the distance between the condensates is so long that their interaction through the evanescent tails is negligible. By numerical simulation we show that the four-wave mixing of the polaritons with the coherent drive produces the free propagating polaritons that can mediate the inter-condensate interaction resulting in the phase-locking of the condensates.

Conclusion: 放弃窄频和非聚焦近似后，光漩涡的横截动量守恒，这为光子ics和光通信提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) has been a topic of active debate in recent years. Previous studies, relying on narrowband and paraxial approximations, resulted in unprecedented conclusions. Some researchers have proposed that electromagnetic waves require a modified definition of OAM to ensure conservation. In this work, we demonstrate that the transverse OAM of STOVs is highly sensitive to these commonly adopted approximations. Using the standard definition of OAM for electromagnetic waves, we demonstrate that the total transverse OAM is conserved during propagation once the narrowband and paraxial assumptions are removed.

Result: The results show that our devices exhibit a 2.38-fold enhancement in the photo-to-dark current ratio compared to weak-coupling counterparts, with applications in exciton diffusion lengths extending from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers.

Conclusion: Our work opens a new pathway for designing ultrasensitive and efficient optoelectronic devices leveraging polaritons and high-index materials.

Abstract: Exciton-polaritons (EPs) arising from strong light-matter coupling offer new pathways for controlling optoelectronic properties. While typically requiring closed optical cavities for strong coupling, we demonstrate that 2D metal-organic chalcogenolates (MOCs), mithrene (AgSePh), with a high refractive index (~2.5) and strong excitons enable self-hybridized polaritons photodetectors (PDs) without top mirrors, simplifying device architecture. Through thickness-tuned multimode polariton engineering, we achieve photodetection of sub-bandgap photons via lower polariton states, validated through reflectance, photoluminescence (PL), and photocurrent spectroscopy with quantitative theoretical agreement. Trap-assisted two-photon absorption enables sustained strong coupling even under sub-bandgap excitation. The polariton dispersion yields ultrafast group velocities (~65 μm/ps), extending exciton diffusion lengths from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. Strong-coupling devices demonstrate a 2.38-fold enhancement in photo-to-dark current ratio compared to weak-coupling counterparts, establishing a practical route to polariton-enhanced photodetection and light harvesting.

Conclusion: CDIP为静态和多光谱显微成像提供了统一框架，扩大了其应用范围，尤其是在光栅、电镜和X射线成像中。

Abstract: CDI is a lensless imaging technique that enables atomic-resolution imaging of non-crystalline specimens and their dynamics. However, its broader implementation has been hindered by the instability and ill-posedness of its reconstruction process, known as phase retrieval, which relies heavily on handcrafted, object-specific constraints. To overcome the key limitations, we propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework that eliminates the need for such constraints by combining untrained coordinate-based neural fields for static and dynamic reconstructions and a physics-consistent forward model. We evaluate CDIP on simulated and experimental datasets that involve both static samples and dynamic processes, demonstrating that it substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability. These results highlight a paradigm shift in both static and time-resolved CDI reconstruction, providing a broadly applicable framework for coherent imaging modalities such as ptychography and holography, across X-ray, electron, and optical probes.

Abstract: Using light to manipulate small particles is a tool with many practical applications throughout biophysics and nanotechnology. These tools have seen a significant increase in performance by utilizing shaped wavefronts, most commonly created with spatial light modulators. Wavefront shaping has also enabled the manipulation of seemingly arbitrary objects, which was impossible with conventional beams. In contrast, we show here the existence of a wide variety of objects that cannot be manipulated as desired, even with the optimal wavefront shaping protocol. The counterintuitive shapes of these objects are found using inverse design. Specifically, we show that the maximal pulling force is reduced by up to three orders of magnitude, and the maximal trapping stiffness is reduced by up to nearly two orders of magnitude. Our findings could prove useful in the development of micromachines that require a predictable mechanical reaction to an arbitrary wave.

Result: The lasers exhibit cavity finesse of 46 dB for single-ring and >46 nm tuning range with 52.6 dB SMSR for dual-ring. They support continuous operation at 80°C and high data rates of 32 Gbps without isolators.

Conclusion: DPG-enabled QD lasers provide an efficient, scalable solution for tunable, feedback-agnostic photonic systems.

Abstract: Single-mode operation is essential for integrated semiconductor lasers, yet most solutions rely on regrowth, etched gratings, or other complex fabrication steps that limit scalability. We show that quantum-dot (QD) lasers can achieve stable single-mode lasing through a simple cavity design using dynamic population gratings (DPGs). Owing to the low lateral carrier diffusion of QDs, a strong standing-wave-induced carrier grating forms in a reverse-biased saturable absorber and provides self-aligned, mode-selective feedback not attainable in quantum-well devices. A single-ring laser achieves 46 dB side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR), while a dual-ring Vernier laser delivers ($>$ 46 nm) tuning range and up to 52.6 dB SMSR, with continuous-wave operation up to $80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The laser remains single-mode under $-10.6$ dB external optical feedback and supports isolator-free data transmission at 32 Gbps. These results establish DPG-enabled QD lasers as a simple and scalable route to tunable, feedback-resilient on-chip light sources for communication, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic systems.

Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of a globally coupled network of heterogeneous FitzHugh Nagumo (FHN) oscillators under stochastic influences, with particular emphasis on the emergence of extreme events (EE). While previous studies explored FHN networks subjected to homogeneous noise, revealing behaviors such as noise-induced synchronization, stochastic resonance, and coherence resonance, the impact of noise heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Moreover, the emergence of EE under heterogeneous stochastic excitation has largely been overlooked. To address these gaps, we capture the natural variability in neuronal responses to external stimuli by introducing nonidentical noise sources, thereby reflecting diversity across the network. Our results reveal that EE can arise both globally, where large excursions occur collectively across the entire network, and partially, where only a subset of oscillators exhibits extreme activity depending on the interplay between noise intensity and coupling strength. We further identify three distinct classes of EE that enrich the system's dynamical repertoire and propose a quantitative metric capable of distinguishing between global and local occurrences. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even under heterogeneous noise inputs, noise can synchronize EE across the network, underscoring the robustness of collective dynamics in stochastic regimes. Furthermore, causal interaction analysis between oscillator pairs provides mechanistic insights into the initiation and propagation of EE. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of both partially and globally synchronized EE triggered solely by noise in a network of coupled oscillators. These findings enhance our understanding of noise-driven collective behavior in complex systems and provide new insights into neuronal dynamics under random influences.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了 CESNs 在复杂多变量时间序列预测中的适应性和优越性，扩展了埃ơ回 repo 网络的适用场景。

Abstract: Many natural and physical processes can be understood by analyzing multiple system variables evolving, forming a multivariate time series. Predicting such time series is challenging due to the inherent noise and interdependencies among variables. Echo state networks (ESNs), a class of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, offer an efficient alternative to conventional recurrent neural networks by training only the output weights while keeping the reservoir dynamics fixed, reducing computational complexity. We propose a clustered ESNs (CESNs) that enhances the ability to model and predict multivariate time series by organizing the reservoir nodes into clusters, each corresponding to a distinct input variable. Input signals are directly mapped to their associated clusters, and intra-cluster connections remain dense while inter-cluster connections are sparse, mimicking the modular architecture of biological neural networks. This architecture improves information processing by limiting cross-variable interference and enhances computational efficiency through independent cluster-wise training via ridge regression. We further explore different reservoir topologies, including ring, Erdős-Rényi (ER), and scale-free (SF) networks, to evaluate their impact predictive performance. Our algorithm works well across diverse real-world datasets such as the stock market, solar wind, and chaotic Rössler system, demonstrating that CESNs consistently outperform conventional ESNs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness to noise, particularly when using ER and SF topologies. These findings highlight the adaptability of CESNs for complex, multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate thermodynamic properties in a quasi-one-dimensional single-component dipolar Fermi gas at finite temperatures. The self-bound fermionic droplet can be achieved by exchange correlations with the long-range dipole-dipole interactions under the quasi-one-dimensional confinement, where the interaction can be tuned by tilting the dipoles along the system coordinate. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show how the liquid-gas phase transition occurs in this system, and elucidate the finite-temperature phase structure consisting of the gas phase, liquid phase, their coexistence, and the spinodal phase. We also discuss its similarity with the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter through the comparison with phenomenological models. Our results would be useful for an interdisciplinary understanding of self-bound fermionic matter as well as an analog quantum simulation of nuclear systems.

Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of ultracold two-component Fermi gases in the presence of a transverse harmonic potential, focusing on the strongly interacting regime in which pairs of fermions form tightly bound molecules. Using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate the equation of state and density profiles for the full fermionic system, which allows us to address the importance of finite-range corrections arising from the internal fermionic structure of the composite bosons. We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions. We also develop an analytical theory for the transverse density profile, capturing its broadening with increasing interaction strength. This work provides a benchmark for an effective bosonic description of strongly bound fermionic dimers and offers new insights into the three- to two-dimensional crossover.

Motivation: Understanding the Kondo effect and its relationship to superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics is a key goal in condensed matter physics. This research aims to bridge these phenomena using quantum simulation platforms.

Method: The authors use a theoretical framework based on the Hubbard model and analyze the system’s phase diagram using the Doniach model, considering factors like interlayer Kondo coupling to interpolate between different physical regimes.

Result: Significant results include the identification of the Doniach phase diagram and the demonstration of tunable parameters enabling a bridge between Kondo lattice physics and cuprate superconductivity.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues for studying unconventional phases of matter experimentally, particularly through ultracold atom systems, by connecting heavy-fermion physics with high-temperature superconductivity.

Abstract: The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, emerges from the antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and conduction fermions, leading to a correlated many-body singlet state. Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.

Abstract: In this paper, a method for deriving master equation is developed for a generic small quantum system, which is locally coupled to an environment as a many-body quantum chaotic system that satisfies the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz, resorting to neither the Born approximation nor the Markov approximation. The total system undergoes Schrödinger evolution, under an initial condition in which the environmental branches possess no correlation with the interaction Hamiltonian. Derivation of the master equation is based on piecewise usage of a second-order expansion of a formal expression, which is derived for the evolution of the environmental branches. Approximations used in the derivation are mainly based on dynamic properties of the environment.

*Gerard Anglès Munné,Paweł Cieśliński,Jan Wójcik,Wiesław Laskowski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Non-classical quantum correlations underpin quantum mechanics and modern technologies. While bipartite Bell inequalities are monogamous, multipartite systems exhibit polygamy. This paper generalizes previous results to reveal that single N-qubit states can violate all combinations of Bell inequalities simultaneously. Symmetry properties of the MABK inequalities are key to constructing such violations. Comparisons with GHZ states show that polygamy offers advantages, with implications for scalable certification of non-classicality. Additional findings include the phenomenon of hyper-polygamy across subsystem sizes, emphasizing the abundance of nonlocality in multi-partite states and their potential applications in quantum technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the monogamy and polygamy of Bell nonlocality is crucial for exploring the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics and its applications in quantum technologies. This paper builds on previous results and investigates the behavior of nonlocality in multi-partite systems, which has important implications for quantum communication, cryptography, and computing.

Method: To analyze the polygamy of Bell nonlocality in multipartite systems, this paper employs the MABK inequalities and their symmetrized versions. The authors derive exact analytical results by leveraging the symmetry properties of these inequalities.

Result: The study demonstrates that multipartite quantum systems exhibit stronger nonlocality than previously thought. Specifically, single N-qubit states can violate all combinations of Bell inequalities simultaneously, and the phenomenon of hyper-polygamy is observed.

Conclusion: The findings of this paper suggest that multipartite systems offer a fundamentally different and richer structure of nonlocality compared to the bipartite case. This insight is essential for advancing our understanding of quantum nonlocality and optimizing its use in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Non-classical quantum correlations underpin both the foundations of quantum mechanics and modern quantum technologies. Among them, Bell nonlocality is a central example. For bipartite Bell inequalities, nonlocal correlations obey strict monogamy: a violation of one inequality precludes violations of other inequalities on the overlapping subsystems. In the multipartite setting, however, Bell nonlocality becomes inherently polygamous. This was previously shown for subsystems obtained by removing a single particle from an $N$-partite system. Here, we generalize this result to arbitrary $(N-k)$-partite subsystems with $k>0$. We demonstrate that a single $N$-qubit state can violate all $\binom{N}{k}$ relevant Bell inequalities simultaneously. We further construct an $N$-qubit Bell inequality, obtained by symmetrizing the $(N-k)$-qubit ones, that is maximally violated by states exhibiting this generalized polygamy. We compare these violations with those achievable by GHZ states and show that polygamy offers an advantage in multipartite scenarios, providing new insights into scalable certification of non-classicality in quantum devices. Our analysis relies on symmetry properties of the MABK inequalities. Finally, we show that this behavior can occur across multiple subsystem sizes, a phenomenon we call hyper-polygamy. These structures reveal the remarkable abundance of nonlocality present in multipartite quantum states and offer perspectives for their applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center can serve as a magnetic sensor for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. Benefiting from its atomic size, the diamond chip can integrate a tremendous amount of NV centers to improve the magnetic-field sensitivity. However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensor's inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the target's inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of roughly 30000 NV centers. Our method shows the ability to not only acquire unambiguous EPR spectra of free radicals, but also monitor their spectroscopic dynamics in real time.

Abstract: The dynamics of long-range quantum Ising models represents a current frontier in experimental physics, notably in trapped ions or Rydberg atomic systems. However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems.

Abstract: When an ensemble of quantum emitters interacts with a common radiation field, their emission becomes collective, giving rise to superradiant and subradiant states, characterized by broadened and narrowed linewidths. In this work, we propose to harness subradiant states for quantum metrology; such states naturally arise in subwavelength-spaced atomic arrays in free space and in small ensembles of emitters coupled to one-dimensional waveguides. We demonstrate that their collective optical response yields sharp, narrow features in the transmittance spectrum, which can be used to enhance sensitivity to external perturbations. This improved sensitivity can be applied to atomic clock operation, spatially resolved imaging of emitter positions, and enables precise detection of both global and spatially varying detunings (such as those induced by electromagnetic fields or gravitational gradients).

Conclusion: 成功的动态生成量子自旋液态需在特定条件下进行，为研究这类独特态提供了新路径和实验指针. 能够通过动态调整实现大尺寸的自旋液态，展示了未来研究的潜力.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are elusive long-range entangled states. Motivated by experiments in Rydberg quantum simulators, recent excitement has centered on the possibility of dynamically preparing a state with quantum spin liquid correlation even when the ground state phase diagram does not exhibit such a topological phase. Understanding the microscopic nature of such quantum spin "lake" states and their relationship to equilibrium spin liquid order remains an essential question. Here, we extend the use of approximately symmetric neural quantum states for real-time evolution and directly simulate the dynamical preparation in systems of up to $N=384$ atoms. We analyze a variety of spin liquid diagnostics as a function of the preparation protocol and optimize the extent of the quantum spin lake thus obtained. In the optimal case, the prepared state shows spin-liquid properties extending over half the system size, with a topological entanglement entropy plateauing close to $γ= \ln 2$. We extract two physical length scales $λ$ and $ξ$ which constrain the extent of the quantum spin lake $\ell$ from above and below.

Abstract: We investigate theoretically the ability of an optical centrifuge - a laser pulse whose linear polarization is rotating at an accelerated rate, to control molecular rotation in the regime when the rigid-rotor approximation breaks down due to coupling between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Our analysis demonstrates that the centrifuge field enables controlled excitation of high rotational states while maintaining relatively low spread along the vibrational coordinate. We contrast this to the rotational excitation by a linearly polarized Gaussian pulse of equal spectral width and pulse energy which, although comparable to the centrifuge-induced rotation, is unavoidably accompanied by a substantial broadening of the vibrational wavepacket.

Abstract: We study the quantum-mechanical bootstrap as it applies to the bound states of several central potentials in three dimensions. As part of this effort, we show how the bootstrap approach may be applied to ``non-algebraic'' potentials, such as the Yukawa potential (which asymptotically decays as an exponential) and a Gaussian potential. We additionally review the bootstrap of the Coulomb potential, demonstrate a high-precision bootstrap of the Cornell potential, and study conformal quantum mechanics. These results further recommend the bootstrap as a numerical method for high-precision calculations of ground-state physics, where applicable: for example, we are able to determine the critical coupling in the Cornell potential to better than one part in $10^7$, the most precise determination to date. Lower bounds on energies are also of high precision, occasionally one part in greater than $10^8$. Finally, we discuss the circumstances under which we are able to obtain meaningful upper bounds on ground-state energies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of existing methods for controlling spin interactions in quantum systems, particularly for improving metrological sensitivity.

Method: Dressed-state qubit encoding under a magnetic field perpendicular to the crystal lattice was used to directly tune the interaction strength in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers.

Result: This method achieved a 3.2× enhancement of the dimensionless coherence parameter JT₂ and a 2.6× increase in AC magnetometry sensitivity (8.3 dB) compared to state-of-the-art Floquet engineering.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate a promising new approach for Hamiltonian engineering in interacting higher-spin systems with potential applications in quantum metrology.

Abstract: In quantum science applications, ranging from many-body physics to quantum metrology, dipolar interactions in spin ensembles are controlled via Floquet engineering. However, this technique typically reduces the interaction strength between spins, and effectively weakens the coupling to a target sensing field, limiting the metrological sensitivity. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a method for direct tuning of the native interaction in an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Our approach utilizes dressed-state qubit encoding under a magnetic field perpendicular to the crystal lattice orientation. This method leads to a $3.2\times$ enhancement of the dimensionless coherence parameter $JT_2$ compared to state-of-the-art Floquet engineering, and a $2.6\times$ ($8.3~$dB) enhanced sensitivity in AC magnetometry. Utilizing the extended coherence we experimentally probe spin transport at intermediate to late times. Our results provide a powerful Hamiltonian engineering tool for future studies with NV ensembles and other interacting higher-spin ($S>\frac{1}{2}$) systems.

Abstract: Building on the recent proposal that a single ``bona fide'' clock suffices to define spacetime's metric, we introduce an Entangled Clock protocol based on singlet-state correlations. Invoking Zeilinger's Foundational Principle, we argue that while the local flow of time, operationally defined as a sequence of detector ``ticks,'' is irreducibly random (one bit per elementary system), the synchronized flow between spatially separated observers depends on their measurement geometry. Comparing the quantum prediction for the coincidence rate with Peres' classical ``bomb fragment'' model, we find that at obtuse relative angles the entangled clock exhibits a 13 percent higher synchronized tick rate than this linear classical benchmark. This ``temporal acceleration'' is linked to contextuality: following Peres, ``unperformed experiments have no results,'' and quantum systems are not constrained to maintain consistency with all counterfactual measurement settings. We stress, however, that for any single measurement angle a suitably tailored classical model can reproduce the quantum rate. The genuinely nonclassical character of the entangled clock emerges only when correlations at several angles are considered simultaneously and are shown to violate Bell-type inequalities. In this sense, the violation of Bell-type bounds serves as a certification that the shared time standard is genuinely quantum.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.

Abstract: Analyzing routes of transport for open quantum systems with non-equilibrium initial conditions is extremely challenging. The state-to-state approach [A. Bose, and P.L. Walters, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 15, 4828-4836] has proven to be a useful method for understanding transport mechanisms in quantum systems interacting with dissipative thermal baths, and has been recently extended to non-Hermitian systems to account for empirical loss. These non-Hermitian descriptions are, however, not capable of describing empirical processes of more general nature, including but not limited to a variety of pumping processes. We extend the state-to-state analysis to account for Lindbladian descriptions of generic dissipative, pumping and decohering processes acting on a system which is exchanging energy with a thermal bath. This Lindblad state-to-state method can elucidate routes of transport in systems coupled to a bath and additionally acted upon by Lindblad jump operators. The method is demonstrated using examples of excitonic aggregates subject to incoherent pumping and draining processes. Using this new state-to-state formalism, we demonstrate the establishment of steady-state excitonic currents across molecular aggregates, yielding a different first-principles approach to quantifying the same.

Abstract: In two previous papers the author described ``Islands of Instability" that may appear in wavefunction models with nonlinear evolution (of a type proposed originally in the context of the Measurement Problem). Such ``IsoI" represent a new scenario for Hamiltonian systems implying so-called ``chaos". Criteria was derived for, and shown to be fulfilled in, some finite-dimensional (multi-qubit) models, and generalized in the second paper to continuum models. But the only example produced of the latter was a model whose linear Schrodinger equation was exactly-solvable. As exact solutions of many-body problems are rare, here I show that the instability criteria can be verified by plugging test-functions into certain computable expressions, bypassing the solvability blockade. The method can accommodate realistic inter-molecular potentials and so may be relevant to instabilities in fluids and gasses.

<details>

Motivation: Sensors are crucial for varied applications, so enhancing their performance using quantum resources is vital.

Method: Compared three quantum architectures (QRCs, QPerc, QNNs) under a standard sensing sequence.

Result: QNNs can boost sensitivity and shorten needed squeezing times, especially with feedback mechanisms.

Conclusion: Quantum neural networks offer a promising approach for advancing quantum metrology through enhanced squeezing-based sensors.

Abstract: Spin squeezing is a powerful resource for quantum metrology, and recent hardware platforms based on interacting qubits provide multiple possible architectures to generate and reverse squeezing during a sensing protocol. In this work, we compare the sensing performance of three such architectures: quantum reservoir computers (QRCs), quantum perceptrons, and multi-layer quantum neural networks (QNNs), when used as squeezing-based field sensors. For all models, we consider a standard metrological sequence consisting of coherent-spin preparation, one-axis-twisting dynamics, field encoding via a weak rotation, time-reversal, and collective readout. We show that a single quantum perceptron generates the same optimal sensitivity as a QRC, but in the perturbative regime it benefits from accelerated squeezing due to steering by the output qubit. Stacking perceptrons into a QNN further amplifies this effect: in a 2-layer QNN with N_in input and N_out output qubits, the optimal squeezing time is reduced by a factor of N_out, while the achievable phase sensitivity remains Heisenberg-limited, Delta phi ~ 1/(N_in + N_out). Moreover, if the layers are used sequentially, first using the outputs to squeeze the inputs and then the inputs to squeeze the outputs, the two contributions to the response add constructively. This yields a sqrt(2) enhancement in sensitivity over a QRC when N_in = N_out and requires shorter total squeezing time. Generalizing to L layers, we show that the metrological gain scales as sqrt(L) while the required squeezing time decreases as 1/N_l, where N_l is the number of qubits per layer. Our results demonstrate that the structure of quantum neural networks can be exploited not only for computation, but also to engineer faster and more sensitive squeezing-based quantum sensors.

Motivation: 加速量子系统中的量子相干性是一个关乎量子计算与量子信息的重要课题，特别是在涉及Unruh效应的情况下，理解量子相干性如何衰减与环境场的质量参数的关系具有理论与实用意义。

Result: 发现探测器在与费米场耦合时比与标量场耦合时更敏锐地响应，且当探测器的能级间距与场的粒子静质量问题相当时，探测器的量子相干性随加速经历的累积效应而迅速衰减，此时通过对质量的增加能够有效延缓量子相干性退化。上述结论为加速量子系统中保护量子相干性提供了理论依据与潜在应用方向。

Conclusion: 针对匀加速情况下量子系统中的量子相干性，若探测器与费米场耦合而非标量场，并且适当调节相对论问题的质量，这一协议可以在实际应用中有效保护量子系统的量子相干性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the interaction between a uniformly accelerated single qubit and a fermionic spinor field. Here we consider both the massless and the massive fermionic spinor fields. The qubit-field interaction occurs over a finite time and was evolved via perturbation theory. This approach yields the transition probability rates, from which we subsequently evaluate the quantum coherence of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector initially prepared in a qubit state. Our findings reveal that the UDW detector responds more when coupled with the fermionic field, and consequently, quantum coherence (for the fermionic case) degrades much more rapidly when compared to the case of the qubit linearly coupled with the scalar field. Moreover, the analysis suggests that particle mass plays a protective role against Unruh-induced decoherence as the rest mass energy becomes comparable to the detector's energy-level spacing, the detector's excitation probability and response decreases, which leads to the mitigation of quantum coherence degradation in accelerated quantum systems.

Abstract: Stabilizer-based simulation of quantum error-correcting codes typically relies on the Pauli-twirling approximation (PTA) to render non-Clifford noise classically tractable, but PTA can distort the behavior of physically relevant channels such as thermal relaxation. Physically accurate noise simulation is needed to train decoders and understand the noise suppression capabilities of quantum error correction codes. In this work, we develop an exact and stabilizer-compatible model of qubit thermal relaxation noise and show that the combined amplitude damping and dephasing channel admits a fully positive probability decomposition into Clifford operations and reset whenever $T_2 \leqslant T_1$. For $T_2 > T_1$, the resulting decomposition is negative, but allows a smaller sampling overhead versus independent channels. We further introduce an approximated error channel with reset that removes the negativity of the decomposition while achieving higher channel fidelity to the true thermal relaxation than PTA, and extend our construction to finite temperature relaxation. We apply the exact combined model to investigate large surface codes and bivariate bicycle codes on superconducting platforms with realistic thermal relaxation error. The differing logical performances across code states further indicate that noise-model-informed decoders will be essential for accurately capturing thermal-noise structure in future fault-tolerant architectures.

Abstract: We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We examine a mechanism of spontaneous decoherence in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order spectral deformation $H^{1+iβ}$ of a positive Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{iβ} = e^{iβ\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates showing that oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $O(1/|β|)$. The Born rule and the Hilbert-space inner product remain unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical.
  The physical motivation for the deformation arises from clock imperfections, renormalization-group and effective-action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical quantum-gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{iβ}$. Examples including FRW minisuperspace, quartic potentials, curved-background Hamiltonians, and a Schwarzschild interior-type model illustrate how the mechanism yields explicit decoherence rates. The parameter $β$ may be experimentally constrained through precision coherence measurements in low-noise quantum platforms. The mechanism contrasts with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Diosi-Penrose gravitational collapse, and real-order fractional dynamics in that it acts purely through deterministic spectral phases of a single Hamiltonian. The analysis positions the framework as a compact and testable phenomenological representation of logarithmic spectral corrections appearing in quantum-gravity-motivated effective theories.

Abstract: We theoretically propose an experimentally viable scheme to explore the transfer of nonclassical correlations from a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to a pair of impurities immersed in it. Operating at ultra-low temperature, density fluctuations of the dipolar BEC emulate a vacuum field with Lorentz-violating dispersion, while the two impurities function as Unruh-DeWitt detectors for the BEC quasiparticles. We study the harvesting of entanglement from the quantum vacuum of this analogue Lorentz-violating quantum field by spatially separated Unruh-DeWitt detectors. Our analysis reveals key parameter dependencies that optimize the harvesting of entanglement. In particular, unlike the Lorentz-invariant case, smoother detector switchings does not enhance the entanglement harvesting efficiency from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum. Moreover, the strength of the Lorentz-invariant violation can shift the optimal energy structure of the detectors for harvesting entanglement from the Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum-a clear deviation from the Lorentz-invariant scenario. As a fundamental quantum mechanical setup, our quantum fluid platform provides an experimentally realizable testbed for examining the entanglement harvesting protocol from an effective Lorentz-violating quantum field vacuum using a pair of impurity probers, which may also has potential implications for exploring the Lorentz-invariant violation in quantum field theory.

Abstract: The Mpemba effect (MpE), where a far-from-equilibrium state of a system relaxes faster compared to a state closer to it, is a well-known counterintuitive phenomenon in classical and quantum systems. Various system-specific theories have been proposed to explain this anomalous behavior in driven systems, though the fundamental mechanism of MpE in undriven systems, where MpE was first observed, remains unresolved. This paper provides a generic model of MpE for a quantum system following Markovian relaxation dynamics, regardless of system structure or environment. The key lies in the overlap of initial states with the fast relaxation mode; here, the constituents create a fast decay mode via interaction through the shared environment to show MpE, indicating MpE happens due to the collective behavior of the system. I also show that a system with anisotropic relaxation naturally exhibits MpE, even without a shared environment among the particles.

Abstract: Three-body interactions are fundamental for realizing novel quantum phenomena beyond pairwise physics, yet their implementation -- particularly among distinct quantum systems -- remains challenging. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enrich quantum physics by extending conventional phase diagrams, enabling novel topological phenomena, and realizing exceptional points with potential applications in quantum sensing. Here, we present an experimental photonic platform capable of simulating a non-unitary quantum walk generated by a peculiar type of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, largely unexplored in the literature. The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena.

Abstract: When light propagates through complex media, its output spatial distribution is highly sensitive to its wavelength. This fundamentally limits the bandwidth of applications ranging from imaging to communication. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that the spatial correlations of hyper-entangled photon pairs, simultaneously entangled spatially and spectrally, remain stable across a broad bandwidth: The chromatic modal dispersion experienced by one photon is canceled to first order by its spectrally anti-correlated twin, defining a "two-photon bandwidth" that can far exceed its classical counterpart. We illustrate this modal dispersion cancellation in multimode fibers, thin diffusers and blazed gratings, and demonstrate its utility for broadband wavefront shaping of quantum states. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of quantum light in complex media with applications in quantum imaging, communication, and sensing.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) and parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are key building blocks for near-term quantum machine learning. However, their scalability is constrained by excessive parameters, barren plateaus, and hardware limitations. We propose LiePrune, the first mathematically grounded one-shot structured pruning framework for QNNs that leverages Lie group structure and quantum geometric information. Each gate is jointly represented in a Lie group--Lie algebra dual space and a quantum geometric feature space, enabling principled redundancy detection and aggressive compression.

Abstract: We investigate massless representations related to the extension of Poincarè group constructed in [1]. These representations differ from Wigner's ones of standard Poincarè group because the stabilizer of lightlike orbits has extra degrees of freedom. The unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of massless particles in this extension must decompose as a direct sum of a massless forward (positive zeroth component momentum) and massless backward (negative zeroth component momentum) Wigner's representations linked by internal two valued degree of freedom. We prove that these representations are unitarily equivalent to entangled states of two qubits. This provides a geometric origin of quantum entanglement for photons in the framework of quantum field theory: photons appear as superpositions of backward and forward propagating electromagnetic waves depending on a two valued parameter and this dependency gives rise to correlations between the values of local observables identical to those experienced with an entangled state of two qubits. Finally we describe an experiment capable of distinguishing the two different values of the parameter that links backward and forward massless representations providing experimental falsification of the theory.

Abstract: Uncertainty relations are fundamental to quantum mechanics, encoding limits on the simultaneous measurement of conjugate observables. Violations of joint uncertainty bounds can certify entanglement -- a resource critical for quantum information protocols and increasingly relevant in strong-field physics. Here, we investigate the pairwise time-delay and frequency-bandwidth uncertainties for arbitrary multimode quantum states of light, deriving a general lower bound for their joint product. We find that the nonclassical correction scales inversely with the average photon number, a behavior rooted in the so-called ``monogamy of entanglement''. These results clarify the intensity scaling of quantum advantages in nonclassical light states and highlight the interplay between entanglement and photon statistics.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems can have higher orders than the system's degrees of freedom due to non-Markovian effects, allowing observation of arbitrarily high-order exceptional points by choosing appropriate observation times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems is crucial for various fields, including optics, quantum mechanics, and condensed matter physics. The ability to control and observe these points opens new possibilities for applications in quantum information and laser technology.

Method: The authors analyzed the dynamics of a system with non-Markovian effects, demonstrating that the system's behavior can be divided into intervals where it follows a product of an exponential and a polynomial function of increasing order. They showed that by selecting specific observation times, one can observe exceptional points of any order.

Result: Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the authors demonstrated that non-Markovian effects allow non-Hermitian systems to exhibit exceptional points of higher orders than their degrees of freedom. They also provided a method to observe such points by choosing appropriate observation times.

Conclusion: This finding challenges the conventional belief that the maximal order of exceptional points is limited by the system's degrees of freedom and provides a new framework for studying and controlling exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Exceptional points are singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in which several eigenvectors are linearly dependent and their eigenvalues are equal to each other. Usually it is assumed that the order of the exceptional point is limited by the number of degrees of freedom of a non-Hermitian system. In this letter, we refute this common opinion and show that non-Markovian effects can lead to dynamics characteristic of systems with exceptional points of higher orders than the number of degrees of freedom in the system. This takes place when the energy returns from reservoir to the system such that the dynamics of the system are divided into intervals in which it describes by the product of the exponential and a polynomial function of ever-increasing order. We demonstrate that by choosing the observation time, it is possible to observe exceptional points of arbitrary high orders.

Abstract: Quantum circuit design is a key bottleneck for practical quantum machine learning on complex, real-world data. We present an automated framework that discovers and refines variational quantum circuits (VQCs) using graph-based Bayesian optimization with a graph neural network (GNN) surrogate. Circuits are represented as graphs and mutated and selected via an expected improvement acquisition function informed by surrogate uncertainty with Monte Carlo dropout. Candidate circuits are evaluated with a hybrid quantum-classical variational classifier on the next generation firewall telemetry and network internet of things (NF-ToN-IoT-V2) cybersecurity dataset, after feature selection and scaling for quantum embedding. We benchmark our pipeline against an MLP-based surrogate, random search, and greedy GNN selection. The GNN-guided optimizer consistently finds circuits with lower complexity and competitive or superior classification accuracy compared to all baselines. Robustness is assessed via a noise study across standard quantum noise channels, including amplitude damping, phase damping, thermal relaxation, depolarizing, and readout bit flip noise. The implementation is fully reproducible, with time benchmarking and export of best found circuits, providing a scalable and interpretable route to automated quantum circuit discovery.

TL;DR: We introduce QGFA, a quantum algorithm for solving SPD linear systems based on gradient flow, which outperforms QMIA when initialized with suitable states, achieving faster convergence and lower relative errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the limitations of existing quantum linear solvers like QMIA, particularly their sensitivity to the condition number, as well as the need for more efficient classical solvers like the conjugate gradient method.

Method: The method involves proposing QGFA, which solves SPD linear systems by leveraging the gradient-flow process of the quadratic energy functional. This is achieved through the variational formulation and time-evolution dynamics, building upon the principles of the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods.

Result: Through application to displacement-based FEM for 2D linear elastic problems, QGFA demonstrates accurate convergence with moderate QSP phase factors. When compared to QMIA, QGFA exhibits superior performance in terms of relative errors and convergence speed.

Conclusion: QGFA represents a significant advancement in quantum linear solvers, offering a physically interpretable bridge between classical iterative methods and quantum computation. Its success opens avenues for future developments in Quantum CAE, including nonlinear and multiphysics simulations.

Abstract: In this study, we propose the Quantum Gradient Flow Algorithm (QGFA), a novel quantum algorithm for solving symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear systems based on the variational formulation and time-evolution dynamics. Conventional quantum linear solvers, such as the quantum matrix inverse algorithm (QMIA), focus on approximating the matrix inverse through quantum signal processing (QSP). However, QMIA suffers from a crucial drawback: its computational efficiency deteriorates as the condition number increases. In contrast, classical SPD linear solvers, such as the steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods, are known for their fast convergence, which stems from the variational optimization principle of SPD systems. Inspired by this, we develop QGFA, which obtains the solution vector through the gradient-flow process of the corresponding quadratic energy functional. To validate the proposed method, we apply QGFA to the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) for two-dimensional linear elastic problems under plane stress conditions. The algorithm demonstrates accurate convergence toward classical FEM solutions even with a moderate number of QSP phase factors. Compared with QMIA, QGFA achieves lower relative errors and faster convergence when initialized with suitable initial states, demonstrating its potential as an efficient preconditioned quantum linear solver. The proposed framework provides a physically interpretable connection between classical iterative solvers and quantum computational paradigms. These findings suggest that QGFA can serve as a foundation for future developments in Quantum Computer-Aided Engineering (Quantum CAE), including nonlinear and multiphysics simulations.

Abstract: Distributed, large-scale quantum computing will need architectures that combine matter-based qubits with photonic links, but today's software stacks target either gate-based chips or linear-optical devices in isolation. We introduce Optyx, an open-source Python framework offering a unified language to program, simulate, and prototype hybrid, networked systems: users create experiments that mix qubit registers, discrete-variable photonic modes, lossy channels, heralded measurements, and real-time feedback; Optyx compiles them via ZX/ZW calculus into optimised tensor-network forms, and executes with state-of-the-art contraction schedulers based on Quimb and Cotengra. Benchmarking on exact multi-photon circuit simulations shows that, versus permanent-based methods, tensor network contraction can deliver speedups of orders of magnitude for low-depth circuits and entangled photon sources, and natively supports loss and distinguishability -- establishing it as both a high-performance simulator and a rapid-prototyping environment for next-generation photonic-network experiments.

This approach is validated through a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating its practicality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entangled states are crucial for many quantum technologies, but verifying them can be challenging when resources are limited. This work addresses the need for efficient and practical methods to confirm entanglement under resource constraints.

Method: The authors introduce a framework that uses a limited number of observables to construct entanglement witnesses. They formulate an optimization approach, specifically a semidefinite program, to find the most effective witnesses for revealing entanglement in the given measurement constraints.

Result: The approach is demonstrated experimentally using photon-polarization qubits, where entanglement is certified using only a fraction of the full measurement data. This shows that incomplete measurement settings can be highly effective for entanglement verification in realistic scenarios.

Conclusion: This framework offers a novel and practical solution for verifying entangled states when full measurement data is not available, highlighting the potential of incomplete measurement settings in quantum technologies.

Abstract: In this work, we present a practical and efficient framework for verifying entangled states when only a tomographically incomplete measurement setting is available-specifically, when access to observables is severely limited. We show how the experimental estimation of a small number of observables can be directly exploited to construct a large family of entanglement witnesses, enabling the efficient identification of entangled states. Moreover, we introduce an optimization approach, formulated as a semidefinite program, that systematically searches for those witnesses best suited to reveal entanglement under the given measurement constraints. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach in a proof-of-principle experiment with photon-polarization qubits, where entanglement is certified using only a fraction of the full measurement data. These results reveal the maximal usefulness of incomplete measurement settings for entanglement verification in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: We study the possibility of detection of ``spin-boson'' entanglement by qubit only measurements. Such entanglement is impossible to detect by previously proposed schemes that involve a fixed system-environment interaction, because of inherent symmetries within the coupling and the initial state of the environment. We take advantage of the possibility of tuning of qubit-environment coupling, that is available in some qubit realizations. As an example we study a superconducting transmon qubit interacting with a microwave cavity, which is one of such systems and is, furthermore, essential in the context of quantum information processing. We propose suitable Hamiltonian parameters for the preparation and measurement phases of the detection scheme that allow for an experimental test, and verify that the reported signal is nonnegligibly large still at finite temperatures.

Motivation: To ensure secure quantum communication by detecting eavesdropping reliably.

Method: Performs a quantum key distribution protocol using the 5-qubit error correction code.

Result: The protocol detects eavesdropping patterns by converting eavesdropping into detectable multi-qubit errors.

Conclusion: Proposed protocol increases security against information theoretical attacks.

Abstract: I propose a new quantum key distribution protocol that uses the five qubit error correction code to detect the presence of eavesdropper reliably. The protocol turns any information theoretical attacks into a classical guess about the pattern. The logical qubit is encoded with a specific pattern into a block of five physical qubits. The security of the protocol relies on the correct pattern choice of Alice and Bob. Decoding with any wrong pattern choice increases multi qubit error rate and the 5 qubit code transforms an eavesdropper's logical disturbance into a signature that is detectable and distinguishable from natural channel noise up to a certain distance.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum secret sharing (DI-QSS) is a cryptographic protocol that overcomes the security limitations posed by untrusted quantum devices. We propose a DI-QSS protocol based on the multipartite pseudo-telepathy parity game, which achieves device-independence with simultaneous key generation without requiring dedicated test rounds, unlike CHSH-based schemes [Zhang et al., Phys. Rev. A, 2024]. Notably, the proposed scheme allows simultaneous device-independence verification and key-generation phases, achieving optimal performance for a seven-qubit GHZ state configuration. Further, we analyse the security of our protocol against collective attack and establish reduced resource requirement for the same length of the raw key compared to the previous protocol. Finally, we show that our protocol remains robust even in a noisy environment.

Abstract: Photon subtraction and addition are essential non-Gaussian processes in quantum optics, where conventional methods using linear optics and number-resolving detection often suffer from low success probability. Here, we introduce the concept of \textit{dynamic stimulated emission}, whereby a quantum emitter undergoes stimulated emission with a time-dependent coupling. We show that, for both two- and three-level emitters, this process can be used to deterministically add or subtract a photon to a single propagating optical mode. We provide semi-analytic solutions to this problem for Fock states, enabling deterministic and unconditional single-photon subtraction and addition with fidelity ${\cal F}>0.996$. Our semi-analytic solutions are provided for both dynamically coupled two-level systems and for three-level systems whose dynamical coupling is controlled by a coherent laser drive. Moving beyond individual Fock states, we further showcase the ability to subtract and add single photons to photon-number superposition states. We show that Schrödinger cat states can be prepared from squeezed vacuum input via cascaded subtraction or cascaded addition. Finally, we show that our photon-addition process can be used to add a photon to any squeezed and displaced state with high success probability and fidelity ${\cal F}>0.99$, thereby potentially converting quantum emitters from single-photon sources to sources of single-photon-added Gaussian states without the need for inline squeezing. Our protocols provide a path towards integrating quantum emitters to construct efficient sources of single-mode non-Gaussian light beyond single photons.

Abstract: The fundamental question of when a static or dynamic system should be deemed intrinsically quantum remains a challenge to address in absolute terms. A rigorous criterion, however, can be established by focusing on the measurable or reconstructible features of the system. This determination transcends mere issues of a system's classical simulability or computational complexity. Instead, the critical requirement lies in the certification (ideally, in real-time) of the emergence and persistence of genuine quantum features, principally entanglement and quantum superposition. Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements (QNDM) serve as the appropriate instrument for this certification, both from a theoretical and experimental standpoint. In this review paper, we demonstrate, with accessible clarity, how the implementation of QNDM can be directly linked to a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism in finite-dimensional systems, establishing a conceptual parallel with Leggett-Garg inequalities. Using concrete examples that detail the detection of negative terms in the quasi-probability density function resulting from QNDM, we introduce the core concepts for certifying genuinely quantum features. As specific examples, we discuss an application where the quantum-to-classical transition due to the interaction with an environment can be tracked by QNDM. Moreover, we argue about the robustness of QNDM protocols in the presence of noise sources and their advantages with respect to the Leggett-Garg inequalities. Because of its straightforward implementation, the QNDM approach can be of direct relevance to both the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, where a controlled generation and certification of genuinely quantum resources is a central concern.

Abstract: We study the problem of certifying local Hamiltonians from real-time access to their dynamics. Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. We introduce the first intolerant Hamiltonian certification protocol that achieves optimal performance for all constant-locality Hamiltonians. For general $n$-qubit, $k$-local, traceless Hamiltonians, our procedure uses $O(c^k/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time for a universal constant $c$, and succeeds with high probability. In particular, for $O(1)$-local Hamiltonians, the total evolution time becomes $Θ(1/\varepsilon)$, matching the known $Ω(1/\varepsilon)$ lower bounds and achieving the gold-standard Heisenberg-limit scaling. Prior certification methods either relied on implementing inverse evolution of $H$, required controlled access to $e^{-itH}$, or achieved near-optimal guarantees only in restricted settings such as the Ising case ($k=2$). In contrast, our algorithm requires neither inverse evolution nor controlled operations: it uses only forward real-time dynamics and achieves optimal intolerant certification for all constant-locality Hamiltonians.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces Pinball, a low-power, high-accuracy cryogenic error correction predecoder for quantum computers, achieving significant energy and performance improvements over existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum computers, particularly those using cryogenic systems, presents significant challenges in terms of scalability, power consumption, and maintaining qubit integrity. This paper addresses the need for an improved predecoder design that can handle real-world quantum noise more effectively while minimizing power and area usage.

Method: The authors developed Pinball, a cryogenic CMOS predecoder tailored for quantum error correction. They employed circuit-level noise modeling, rigorous error rate analysis, and co-design techniques with advanced semiconductor technology to optimize the device's performance. The design accounts for various sources of error, including propagation through quantum error correction circuits, and integrates voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing to enhance efficiency.

Result: Pinball achieves dramatic improvements in error correction performance. Compared to the state-of-the-art room-temperature predecoder, Pinball reduces logical error rates (LER) by 32.58x and 5x, respectively. It also reduces syndrome bandwidth by a factor of 3780.72x. Additionally, by leveraging 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, Pinball consumes under 0.56 mW under peak power and achieves 67.4x total energy savings when combined with voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing. Under a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, Pinball supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21, demonstrating significant scalability.

Conclusion: This paper presents Pinball, a groundbreaking approach to cryogenic error correction in quantum computing. By integrating advanced design methodologies, state-of-the-art semiconductor technology, and innovative power management strategies, Pinball represents a major leap forward in achieving both high error correction performance and low power consumption in large-scale quantum systems.

Abstract: Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.
  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm for computing the Ollivier Ricci curvature, a discrete analogue of the Ricci curvature defined via optimal transport on graphs and general metric spaces. This curvature has seen applications ranging from signaling fragility in financial networks to serving as basic quantities in combinatorial quantum gravity. For inputs given as a point cloud with pairwise distances, we show that our algorithm can achieve an exponential speedup over the best-known classical methods for two particular classes of problem.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了Transformer模型在量子计算中的潜力，并提供了一种高效的解决方案。这为我们理解不同领域之间的技术转移提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Transformers have gained popularity in machine learning due to their application in the field of natural language processing. They manipulate and process text efficiently, capturing long-range dependencies among data and performing the next word prediction. On the other hand, gate-based quantum computing is based on controlling the register of qubits in the quantum hardware by applying a sequence of gates, a process which can be interpreted as a low level text programming language. We develop a transformer model capable of transpiling quantum circuits from the qasm standard to other sets of gates native suited for a specific target quantum hardware, in our case the set for the trapped-ion quantum computers of IonQ. The feasibility of a translation up to five qubits is demonstrated with a percentage of correctly transpiled target circuits equal or superior to 99.98%. Regardless the depth of the register and the number of gates applied, we prove that the complexity of the transformer model scales, in the worst case scenario, with a polynomial trend by increasing the depth of the register and the length of the circuit, allowing models with a higher number of parameters to be efficiently trained on HPC infrastructures.

Conclusion: 量子计算的TRNG具备潜力，建议在实际应用中优先使用Odra 5。

Abstract: Random number generation is fundamental for many modern applications including cryptography, simulations and machine learning. Traditional pseudo-random numbers may offer statistical unpredictability, but are ultimately deterministic. On the other hand, True Random Number Generation (TRNG) offers true randomness. One way of obtaining such randomness are quantum systems, including quantum computers. As such the use of quantum computers for TRNG has received considerable attention in recent years. However, existing studies almost exclusively consider IBM quantum computers, often stop at using simulations and usually test only a handful of different TRNG quantum circuits. In this paper, we address those issues by presenting a study of TRNG circuits on Odra 5 a real-life quantum computer installed at Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It is also the first study to utilize the IQM superconducting architecture. Since Odra 5 is available on-premises it allows for much more comprehensive study of various TRNG circuits. In particular, we consider 5 types of TRNG circuits with 105 circuit subvariants in total. Each circuit is used to generate 1 million bits. We then perform an analysis of the quality of the obtained random sequences using the NIST SP 800-22 and NIST SP 800-90B test suites. We also provide a comprehensive review of existing literature on quantum computer-based TRNGs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is typically viewed as a suite of practical techniques for today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, with limited relevance once fault-tolerant quantum computers become available. In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even more efficient manner than it does on current devices. We introduce a framework for logical-level QEM that leverages soft information naturally produced by QEC decoders, requiring no additional data, hardware modifications, or runtime overhead beyond what QEC protocols already provide. Within this framework, we develop and analyze three logical-level QEM techniques: post-selection and runtime abort policies, probabilistic error cancellation, and zero-noise extrapolation. Our techniques reduce logical error rates by more than 100x while discarding fewer than 0.1% of shots; they also provide in situ characterization of logical channels for QEM protocols. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our approach using a surface-code architecture and two state-of-the-art decoders based on tensor-network contraction and minimum-weight perfect matching. We evaluate logical-level QEM on random Clifford circuits and molecular simulation algorithms and find that, compared to previous approaches relying on QEC only or QEC combined with QEM, we can achieve up to 87.4% spacetime overhead savings. Our results demonstrate that logical-level QEM with QEC decoder soft information can reliably improve logical performance, underscoring the efficiency and usefulness of QEM techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computers.

*Francisco M. Fernández*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Two quantum mechanical models with elliptical symmetry are analyzed. One non-Hermitian model maintains a two-fold degeneracy in its energy levels, while a Hermitian model does not exhibit this degeneracy, with energy levels splitting at higher orders of perturbation theory. Both models adhere to the same point-group symmetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research delves into the quantum mechanical properties of elliptical paths, comparing non-Hermitian and Hermitian operators while respecting symmetry groups.

Method: The analysis involves deriving Hamiltonian operators for both models and examining their energy level degeneracy and symmetry properties.

Result: The non-Hermitian model preserves two-fold degeneracy, while the Hermitian model does not exhibit this feature, with energy levels splitting progressively with perturbation order.

Conclusion: This study highlights the impact of operator Hermiticity and symmetry on energy level degeneracy in quantum systems.

Abstract: We analyze two simple models derived from a quantum-mechanical particle on an elliptical path. The first Hamiltonian operator is non-Hermitian but isomorphic to an Hermitian operator. It appears to exhibit the same two-fold degeneracy as the particle on a circular path. More precisely, $E_n=n^2E_1,\ n=1,2,\ldots$ (in addition to an exact eigenvalue $E_0=0$). The second Hamiltonian operator is Hermitian and does not exhibit such degeneracy. In this case the nth excited energy level splits at the nth order of perturbation theory. Both models can be described in terms of the same point-group symmetry.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a simple variational framework for planar elastica that enables distributed energies, such as gravitational loading or magnetic body torques, to be incorporated in a modular and unified manner. The formulation is based on expressing all load induced contributions directly at the level of the energy functional, which avoids the force balance constructions used in classical treatments such as Wang (1986) and makes the inclusion of additional physical effects straightforward. The resulting planar energy functional yields compact governing equations in which the contributions of individual load types remain clearly separated. We demonstrate that the framework reproduces the classical heavy elastica equations exactly and naturally accommodates magnetic energy terms commonly used in hard magnetic rod models. Although mathematically elementary, the formulation provides a clean and extensible structure for describing planar rod deformations under general distributed loads.

TL;DR: A lightweight convolutional neural network for real-time betatron tune measurement with uncertainty quantification in compact proton synchrotrons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate beam control in compact proton-therapy synchrotrons requires precise measurement of betatron tune, but low SNR makes conventional methods unreliable. This work addresses this challenge with a novel neural network approach.

Method: The model uses an attention-based pooling mechanism and a dual-branch architecture to predict betatron tune and its uncertainty. It employs a Laplace negative log-likelihood loss function and integrates uncertainty-aware Kalman filtering for robust performance.

Result: Experiments show the model outperforms traditional methods across SNR levels, with effective suppression of transient outliers using Kalman filtering. Preliminary validation on real beam data demonstrates stable operation without retraining.

Conclusion: This approach offers a practical solution for real-time betatron tune monitoring in compact accelerators with low computational overhead.

Abstract: Betatron tune measurement is essential for beam control in compact proton-therapy synchrotrons, yet conventional peak-detection techniques are not robust under the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions typical of these machines. This work presents a lightweight convolutional neural network that performs real-time tune extraction from Schottky spectra with sub-millisecond inference latency and calibrated uncertainty estimates. The model uses attention-based pooling for reliable peak localization and a dual-branch architecture that jointly predicts the tune and its associated uncertainty. Trained with a Laplace negative log-likelihood loss, it produces uncertainty estimates whose magnitude tracks the instantaneous prediction error, which enables uncertainty-aware Kalman filtering for temporal smoothing. Experiments on a large synthetic dataset spanning SNR levels from 0 to $-20$\,dB demonstrate substantial performance gains over traditional peak-detection baselines, while the Kalman filter further suppresses transient outliers in time-series operation. Preliminary validation on operational beam data confirms stable tune tracking without retraining. With only about $2.0\times 10^{4}$ trainable parameters and real-time inference on commodity GPU hardware, the proposed diagnostic offers a practical solution for rapid and accurate betatron tune monitoring in compact medical synchrotrons and similar accelerators.

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR:  particle accelerator control systems need better computational infrastructure due to complexity and scale. FaaS helps with event-driven execution, scaling, and resource efficiency. This paper evaluates FaaS in such contexts and finds mixed reliability depending on implementation. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to evaluate the applicability of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) frameworks in modern particle accelerator control systems. The motivation stems from the increasing complexity and scale of such systems, which require efficient and scalable computational infrastructure. FaaS offers a promising solution with its event-driven execution and automatic scaling capabilities, making it suitable for handling the dynamic and triggered nature of accelerator operations. The paper seeks to provide insights into the performance and reliability of FaaS in this context, which is crucial for the effective operation of these systems. 

Method: The paper evaluates prominent open-source FaaS platforms by analyzing their performance in executing functional logic, triggers, and diagnostics. The evaluation metrics include cold-start latency, scalability, performance, and integration with other tools like Kafka. Workloads are designed to simulate real-world control tasks and are benchmarked under various conditions. Self-hosted FaaS platforms are compared for their control over execution environments and integration with legacy systems. The methodology also considers the pairing of FaaS with message queues for real-time guarantees. The paper concludes based on the evaluation metrics and lessons learned from these experiments. 

Result: The evaluation reveals both strengths and weaknesses of FaaS platforms in the context of particle accelerator control systems. Self-hosted FaaS platforms demonstrate excellent control over execution environments and integration with legacy systems, making them suitable for environments where such control is crucial. They also support real-time guarantees when paired with appropriate message queues. However, cold-start latency is a significant issue, and scalability remains a challenge under high invocation loads and varying network conditions. Additionally, the integration with Kafka and other tools may introduce performance overheads, affecting overall efficiency. These findings highlight the potential of FaaS but also point out areas needing optimization for better performance and scalability in large-scale, complex systems. 

Conclusion: In conclusion, while FaaS frameworks show promise for executing functional logic, triggers, and diagnostics in particle accelerator control systems, their reliability and ease of use depend on proper deployment and network conditions. Self-hosted FaaS platforms offer the flexibility and integration needed for legacy systems but face limitations in scalability and cold-start latency. The pairing of FaaS with resource-efficient message queues, like Kafka, is essential for achieving real-time guarantees. The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding the specific requirements of the control systems when implementing FaaS frameworks to ensure optimal performance and reliability. The findings provide a foundation for future research and development in FaaS for particle accelerator applications, highlighting areas such as further optimization of cold-start mechanisms and scalability improvements through network-aware deployment strategies. 

Abstract: As particle accelerator control systems evolve in complexity and scale, the need for responsive, scalable, and cost-effective computational infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) offers an alternative to traditional monolithic architecture by enabling event-driven execution, automatic scaling, and fine-grained resource utilization. This paper explores the applicability and performance of FaaS frameworks in the context of a modern particle accelerator control system, with the objective of evaluating their suitability for short lived and triggered workloads. In this paper, we evaluate prominent open-source FaaS platforms in executing functional logic, triggers, and diagnostics routines. Evaluation metrics consist of cold-start latency, scalability, performance, integration with other open-source tools like Kafka. Experimental workloads were designed to simulate real-world control tasks when implemented as stateless FaaS functions. These workloads were benchmarked under various invocation loads and network conditions. Self-hosted FaaS platforms, when deployed within accelerator networks, offer greater control over execution environment, better integration with legacy systems, and support for real-time guarantees when paired with message queues. Based on lessons learned and evaluation metrics, this paper describes reliability of the FaaS framework for the Accelerator Control Systems (ACS).

TL;DR: The study reports a new method to synthesize CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids using solvent-directed laser ablation, which exhibits high efficiency in visible light photocatalysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photovoltaic applications using van der Waals crystals are limited by their absorption properties, and this paper addresses this by engineering their optoelectronic properties using a novel synthesis method.

Method: The researchers employed a solvothermal laser ablation technique to synthesize the nanocolloids, using water and isopropanol as solvents.

Result: The CdPS3 layer can be reduced to CdS quantum dots and defect sites, enhancing the material's ability to absorb visible light. This leads to efficient photocatalysis of methylene blue with a 90% light-induced degradation within 30 minutes.

Conclusion: Solvent-directed laser ablation is an effective method for defect engineering of ternary van der Waals materials, with potential applications in highly efficient photocatalysts.

Abstract: The limited visible-light absorption of wide-bandgap van der Waals crystals fundamentally restricts their utility in solar energy conversion. Here, we report a surfactant-free, solvent-directed laser synthesis strategy to engineer the phase and optoelectronic properties of Cadmium Phosphorus Trisulfide (CdPS3). By exploiting the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate a tunable transition from the stoichiometric ternary phase to a highly active binary-rich heterostructure. While ablation in water preserves the monoclinic CdPS3 lattice, the reducing environment of isopropanol triggers the formation of CdS quantum dots and metallic cadmium defect sites. This solvent-induced phase engineering transforms the ultraviolet-active host into a robust visible-light photocatalyst. The resulting hybrid CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids exhibit superior charge separation efficiency, driven by Schottky-like metal-semiconductor junctions, achieving ~ 90% degradation of Methylene Blue under 532 nm irradiation within 30 minutes. This work establishes fs-PLAL as a scalable defect-engineering tool for complex ternary layered materials, offering a new design of high-performance metal-thiophosphate-based photocatalysts.

Abstract: The coherent interaction between magnons and phonons in the low-GHz regime represents an unexplored frontier in hybrid magnonics, critical for quantum information processing and microwave-to-acoustic transduction. While previous studies have focused on higher frequencies (>5 GHz), we demonstrate magnon-phonon coupling near 2 GHz using spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waveguides integrated with yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films of varying thicknesses. SSPP waveguides provide strong slow-wave enhancement, enabling efficient magnon readout in this challenging regime. Systematic measurements reveal the dependence of coupling strength on YIG thickness and phonon wavelength matching, achieving cooperativity C = 1 for a 3 $μ$m film at 2 GHz. Angle-dependent studies uncover coupling to both transverse and longitudinal phonon modes. Further investigation shows that thicker films exhibit rich multimode dynamics between high-order magnons and HBAR phonons. These results establish a robust low-GHz magnomechanical platform, opening pathways for multimode quantum transduction and hardware-efficient quantum technologies.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an ARIMA-based model to predict pressure in distribution networks, improving pressure management in urban water systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Water utilities are increasingly concerned about pressure management in distribution networks, as pressure variations can be due to normal losses or anomalies, affecting system efficiency and reliability.

Method: The study uses the Box-Jenkins methodology to develop an ARIMA-based predictive model, validated with real data from Noja, Spain.

Result: The model accurately forecasts pressure, enabling detection of anomalies and improving network management.

Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential of advanced modeling techniques in optimizing water distribution networks, providing valuable insights for urban water systems to enhance reliability, efficiency, and sustainability.

Abstract: Water utilities are increasingly concerned about losses, leaks, and illegal connections in their distribution networks. Pressure control is typically managed through pressure reducing valves with electrically controlled actuators based on predefined tables according to the pressure at the critical point control. This openloop control method lacks direct feedback between the PRV and CPC, making it challenging to distinguish whether pressure variations originate from normal head losses or abnormal network conditions. Unlike traditional applications of ARIMA focused on water demand forecasting, this study explores its novel use in pressure management within distribution networks, aiming to predict P3 pressure based on head losses across a defined hydraulic sector. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the Box-Jenkins methodology and its variations is implemented to analyse time series data. An action path is established to determine the optimal model ARIMA, ARMA, ARMAX, etc. which is subsequently validated using real operational data from Noja, a coastal town in northern Spain characterized by significant seasonal population fluctuations. By accurately forecasting CPC pressure, this system enhances the detection of anomalous patterns, enabling more efficient network pressure management. The study demonstrates the potential of advanced modelling techniques in optimizing water distribution networks, providing valuable insights to improve system efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in urban environments.

### [94] [Comparison of time-resolved photoluminescence and deep-level transient spectroscopy defect evaluations in an InAs nBn detector subjected to in-situ and ex-situ 63 MeV proton irradiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09837)

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the generation and recombination dynamics of an InAs nBn photodetector under proton irradiation using DTS and PTL measurements. In-situ and ex-situ irradiation, followed by temperature-dependent PTL and DTS, revealed distinct depths for the generation and recombination defects. The in-situ irradiation showed a faster recombination due to faster annealing, while the ex-situ irradiation revealed slightly slower recombination with both generation and recombination occurring near 275 meV. The analysis suggests additional recombination occurs via a defect below 100 meV, which likely contributes to the overall recombination process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photodetectors are vital in various fields such as quantum computing, optical sensing, and photovoltaics. Understanding their recombination mechanisms is crucial for improving their efficiency and stability, especially under radiation exposure. This paper focuses on InAs nBn photodetectors under 63 MeV proton irradiation.

Method: The study employs DTS and PTL measurements to analyze the generation and recombination dynamics of carriers in the photodetector. Two methods of irradiation—insitu (conducting the irradiation at the device's operating temperature) and ex-situ (irradiating at room temperature and measuring the device at a higher temperature)—are used to assess the impact of temperature on carrier dynamics and defect formation.

Result: The findings show that in-situ irradiation leads to a faster recombination rate compared to ex-situ irradiation, attributed to the faster annealing of proton-induced defects at the operation temperature. The defects responsible for generation and recombination are both present and nearby in energy, with the recombination defects likely below 100 meV. The analysis further provides an estimate of the recombination cross-section for these defects, which is critical for modeling and optimizing the photodetector's performance under irradiation.

Conclusion: This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the generation and recombination mechanisms in InAs nBn photodetectors under proton irradiation. The results highlight the importance of considering temperature-dependent effects on carrier dynamics and defect formation, providing valuable insights for optimizing photodetector reliability and performance under radiation exposure.

Abstract: Deep-level transient spectroscopy and temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence experiments are performed on identical InAs nBn photodetector structures as a function of in-situ and ex-situ 63 MeV proton irradiation to assess their generation and recombination dynamics. Pre-irradiation, the n-type InAs absorbing region exhibits a steadily increasing minority carrier lifetime with increasing temperature, providing evidence that excited minority carriers may be recombining via shallow defect levels. From deep-level transient spectroscopy, two features are found between 10 K and 275 K: a low temperature broad shoulder, which suggests emission from multiple shallow electron defect levels with energies < 29 meV, and a high temperature minimum occurring at approximately 230 K with an activation energy of 539 meV, which suggests a defect in the barrier layer in the device. Two similar nBn detectors are then subjected to 63 MeV proton irradiation in step doses and measured between steps. One experiment is performed in-situ with an nBn held at approximately 10 K during dosing, and the other experiment is performed ex-situ with a similar nBn held at room temperature for dosing. The ex-situ dosing results in an evaluation of the defect introduction rate that is 3-4x lower than in-situ due to partial annealing of the proton-induced displacement damage at room temperature. The results for these two experiments are then compared with the dose-dependent recombination rate analysis, resulting in an estimated recombination defect cross-section of 1.6x10^(-14) cm^2 for the shallow shoulder defect.

Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.

Abstract: A microscopically resolved picture of energy flow in atom-diatom collisions is essential for understanding the non-equilibrium chemistry in rarefied and hypersonic gas flow. Here, a comprehensive ensemble of quasi-classical trajectories on global, reactive, and ``vetted'' potential energy surfaces are employed to construct state-resolved probability maps and to determine the dependence of the outcomes on the initial ro-vibrational states $(v,j)$. The full range of processes, including elastic, inelastic, atom exchange, reactive, and atomization are quantified, revealing distinct structure reactivity relationships. For the [OOO] system consistent trends are obtained from two high-quality potential energy surfaces, despite their different electronic structure and representation techniques. The resulting state-space description provides a comprehensive picture of energy redistribution in high-energy atom-diatom collisions, forming a basis for improved modeling of non-equilibrium chemistry in hypersonic and rarefied environments.

Abstract: The functional properties of photoactive proteins are governed by the interplay between bright and dark excited states. While the bright states are well-studied, the dark states, which are fundamental to photostability and light harvesting, are notoriously difficult to characterize. Here, we report the direct observation and full characterization of an optically dark, low-lying singlet excited state in the isolated anion of the meta green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore. Using a combination of ultrafast time-resolved action-absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy, we have captured the formation of this state in 100 fs and measured its remarkably long lifetime of 94 ps. We unambiguously assign its charge-transfer character and reveal the precise trapping mechanism through high-level ab initio calculations. Our findings uncover a photoprotective mechanism in biomolecular anions where ultrafast internal conversion quenches electron emission, stabilizing long-lived electronic excitation even when the energy exceeds the electron detachment threshold.

Abstract: We propose a real-time time-dependent ab__initio approach within a configuration-interaction-singles ansatz to decompose the high-harmonic generation (HHG) signal of molecules in terms of individual molecular-orbital (MO) contributions. Calculations have been performed by propagating the time-dependent Schr{ö}dinger equation with complex energies, in order to account for ionization of the system, and by using tailored Gaussian basis sets for high-energy and continuum states. We have studied the strong-field electron dynamics and the HHG spectra in aligned CO2 and H2O molecules. Contribution from MOs in the strong-field dynamics depends on the interplay between the MO ionization energy and the coupling between the MO and the laser-pulse symmetries. Such contributions characterize different portions of the HHG spectrum, indicating that the orbital decomposition encodes nontrivial information on the modulation of the strong-field dynamics. Our results correctly reproduce the MO contributions to HHG for CO2 as described in the literature experimental and theoretical data and lead to an original analysis of the role of the highest occupied molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2 of H2O according to the polarization direction of the laser pulse.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive.

Abstract: We construct the metric-affine analogue of the quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. We begin with a general metric-affine scalar-tensor action that is linear in curvature and contains all operators that are at most quadratic in the covariant second derivatives of the scalar field, ensuring that the connection enters only through curvature and through these second derivatives. Solving the connection equation by performing a full decomposition of the distortion tensor gives a closed-form effective metric theory. Imposing the standard metric DHOST degeneracy conditions then selects a Palatini Class Ia branch that is fully determined by two free functions in the original action. Analyzing the tensor sector shows that requiring gravitational waves to propagate at the speed of light further restricts the theory to a one-function family. These results provide a detailed and self-contained characterization of the quadratic metric-affine Class Ia sector within this operator basis and identify the theoretical conditions implied by gravitational wave observations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Possible measures for Quantum Gravity are considered. Choices that are invariant under diffeomorphisms are analyzed, but the possibility of employing non invariant measures is also taken into account. The last possibility may be accepted if the anomaly in the measure is compensated by counter term redefinitions of the model under analysis. Particular attention is paid to some concrete examples of non covariant looking measures, which may be useful for generalizing the Veltmann identities when quantizing around curved space times. The results are specified for the Stelle gravity model [1]-[2], which is known to be renormalizable in flat space, although not known to be so in curved ones.

Abstract: Direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) are an important component of the massive black hole population of the early universe, and their formation and early mergers will be prominent in the data stream of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, the population and binary properties of these early black holes are poorly understood, with masses, mass ratios, spins, and orbital eccentricities strongly dependent on the details of their formation, and the properties of the remaining exterior material (baryonic and non-baryonic), which may be substantial to the point of merger.
  We report on initial work to simulate the formation, collapse, and/or merger of such DCBH regions in order to extract the resulting gravitational-wave signals.

*Tianyuan Cai,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR:  Massless Majorana spinors can be explicitly solved if at least one of the complex constants ε₁ or ε₂ is zero, but they don't exist otherwise; photons can't exist either due to specific spacetime dependencies. In Schwarzschild spacetime, there's a high probability these spinors move far away as time goes on.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The original paper explores the nonexistence and behavior of certain spinors in quantum gravity, contributing to our understanding of these complex particles and spacetime. Its findings are significant theoretically.

Method:  The study uses a combination of separation of variables in the Dirac equation, analysis of photon orbits in spacetime, and examining the decay of spinor solutions. It also involves exploring symmetry and self-adjointness in Hamiltonian systems.

Result:  Nonexistence is proven for certain spinors in Kerr and Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes, explicit solutions are found in simpler Schwarzschild cases, and long-term behavior of spinors is studied in Schwarzschild spacetime. These results deepen our knowledge of spinor solutions in curved spacetimes and their physical implications.

Conclusion:  The paper contributes theoretical results on spinor existence and behavior, showing that some Majorana spinors can't exist due to spacetime dependencies, while others can only exist in highly symmetric cases. The nonexistence of certain spinors in Schwarzschild spacetime and their rarity as time progresses adds depth to our understanding of their physical behavior.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that massive Majorana spinors \eqref{1.2} do not exist if they are $t$-dependent or $φ$-dependent in Kerr, or Kerr-(A)dS spacetimes. For massless Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime, the Dirac equation can be separated into radial and angular equations, parameterized by two complex constants $ε_1$, $ε_2$. If at least one of $ε_1$, $ε_2$ is zero, massless Majorana spinors can be solved explicitly. If $ε_1$, $ε_2$ are nonzero, we prove the nonexistence of massless time-periodic Majorana spinors in the non-extreme Kerr spacetime which are $L^p$ outside the event horizon for $ 0<p\le\frac{6}{|ε_1|+|ε_2| +2}$. We then provide the Hamiltonian formulation for massless Majorana spinors and prove that the self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian leads to the angular momentum $a=0$ and spacetime reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime, moreover, the massless Majorana spinor must be $φ$-independent. Finally, we show that, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, for initial data with $L^2$ decay at infinity, the probability of the massless Majorana spinors to be in any compact region of space tends to zero as time tends to infinity.

Abstract: Analytical studies of light bending in a dispersive medium near compact objects, e.g., black holes or neutron stars, are most challenged by a suitable definition of the medium. The most realistic model would be a hot magnetized plasma. In such a medium, however, an analytical description of light rays is very difficult. Therefore, usually an isotropic dispersive medium is assumed in analytical calculations. While it is possible to formulate equations for a general refractive index, which some studies do, most attention in the literature is given to the particular case of a cold, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma. Whereas this model covers many astrophysically relevant situations, there are indications that in some cases the plasma temperature is so high that the approximation of a cold plasma is no longer valid. For this reason, we consider in this paper a warm, non-magnetized electron-ion plasma, where the temperature is not set equal to zero but assumed to be small enough, such that relevant equations can be linearized with respect to it. After discussing the general equations for light rays in such a medium on a general-relativistic spacetime, we specify to the axially symmetric and stationary case which includes the spherically symmetric and static case. In particular, we calculate the influence of a warm plasma on the bending angle. In the spherically symmetric and static case, we also calculate the shadow in a warm plasma. We illustrate the general results with a static (respectively corotating) and an infalling warm plasma on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes.

Conclusion: 这些结果表明该方法在研究非黎曼几何下的引力理论中具有广泛的应用前景，为理解上述不同理论的内在联系和特性提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: We develop a unified algebraic and effective field theory (EFT) formulation for non--Riemannian extensions of General Relativity with an independent connection. For metric--affine $f(R,Q)$ gravity we show that the connection equations admit an exact matrix solution, whose square--root structure generates a convergent binomial/Neumann expansion in powers of the stress tensor $T_{μν}$. For the Eddington--inspired Born--Infeld (EiBI) theory we show that the connection can be solved algebraically as well, and that its determinantal field equations produce a parallel Neumann expansion with coefficients fixed by the underlying determinant operator. This allows us to rewrite the Einstein--like equations in the auxiliary metric as an effective Einstein equation for $g_{μν}$ with a local algebraic correction $(ΔT)_{μν}$ that follows from a dual EFT built from the invariants $\{T,\,T^2,\,T_{μν}T^{μν},\ldots\}$, organised by a characteristic density scale. We prove a convergence criterion based on the spectral radius of $\hat T^μ_ν$ and interpret EiBI gravity as a determinantal resummation of the same $T$--tower. Extending the framework to symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, we identify the EFT coefficients in terms of $f_Q$ and $f_{QQ}$ and present a background matching for $f(Q)=Q+αQ^2$. The resulting dual EFT provides a common algebraic language for metric--affine, Born--Infeld and non--metricity gravities.

Motivation: 研究I-Love-Q关系在不同转速下的适用性，尤其是当M0未知或不可观测时的解决方案。

Method: 比较了两种方法：直接利用M0并行，和引入δM改进。

Result: M0并行仅适用于小的旋转参数χ_S，而δM方法在所有χ_S适用。

Conclusion: 应优先使用δM方法来更准确地确定I-Love-Q关系。

Abstract: In relativistic Astrophysics the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to approximately EoS-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment through some quantities that are normalised by the mass $M_0$ of the background configuration of the perturbative scheme. Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $χ_S<0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$δM$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons.

Abstract: In this study, we uncover the accretion dynamics and oscillatory behavior around rotating black holes within the EEH nonlinear electrodynamic framework by analyzing both the motion of test particles and numerically solving the general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. Using EEH geometry, we compute the structure of circular motion, the effective potential and force, and we evaluate the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies together with the Lense-Thirring and periastron precession rates. Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations.

Abstract: We consider static charged fluid spheres with a cosmological constant. We assume a polytropic equation of state, $p \propto ρ^Γ$, and a power law charge distribution, $q\propto r^n$. Using this, we convert the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation into a differential equation for the mass profile. By solving this equation numerically, we analyse both physical and geometric properties of these charged fluid spheres for different values of $n$ and $Γ$. By imposing subluminal sound speeds and energy conditions, we restrict ourselves to configurations that are physically acceptable. Then, within these physical models, we study internal trapping of circular geodesics and find the trapping regions in the $n$-$Γ$ parameter space. Going beyond the traditionally studied case of null geodesics, we consider orbits of charged and/or massive particles. We show that for neutral null particles (and only for them), their trapping depends purely on the properties of the space-time. In the other three cases, properties such as the particle's own charge and/or energy also play a role. In general, we find that trapping of all types of particles is allowed for a broad range of $n$ and $Γ$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researchers are trying to understand how non-asymptotically flat geometries affect black hole photonics and the images they produce.

Method:  Simulate light trajectories and reconstruct optical appearances for modified black holes and ultra-compact objects in anti-de Sitter space-time.

Result:  Changes in the viewable region of black holes can serve as a test for alternative models to the Kerr paradigm. Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black holes and black strings exhibit distinct departures from the canonical Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, influenced by their different space-time geometries.

Conclusion:  This research offers a potential method for distinguishing different classes of black holes and other compact objects based on their images observed from a distance, particularly for future VLBI observations.

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging of the central objects in the M87 and Milky Way galaxies provide compelling evidence that these objects are consistent with (Kerr) black holes. In view of these observations and the future expectations of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) on which the EHT observations are based, an intensive research work has been carried out in the literature to simulating light trajectories and reconstructing the corresponding optical appearance for a wide array of modified black holes and ultra-compact objects. The corresponding images are directly affected not only by the background space-time geometry but also by the physics of the accretion disk, whose combination yields a characteristic fingerprint. In this paper, we consider such a fingerprint for objects which are not asymptotically flat but instead approach a Anti-de Sitter space-time. This assumption significantly influences light trajectories and, consequently, the corresponding images of the objects as seen by an observer at some distance, which can be used in future VLBI observations for testing alternatives of this kind to the Kerr paradigm. We illustrate our considerations with the examples of a Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole and a black string, discussing their most notable departures from canonical, asymptotically-flat black hole space-times.

Abstract: Using the odd and even ``basis vectors'', which are the superposition of odd and even products of $γ^a$'s, to describe the internal spaces of the second quantised fermion and boson fields, respectively, offers in even-dimensional spaces, like it is $d=(13+1)$, the unique description of all the properties of the observed fermion fields (quarks and leptons and antiquarks and antileptons appearing in families) and boson fields (gravitons, photons, weak bosons, gluons and scalars) in a unique way, providing that all the fields have non zero momenta only in $d =(3+1)$ of the ordinary space-time, bosons have the space index $α$ (which is for tensors and vectors $μ=(0,1,2,3)$ and for scalars $σ\ge 5$). In any even-dimensional space, there is the same number of internal states of fermions appearing in families and their Hermitian conjugate partners as it is of the two orthogonal groups of boson fields having the Hermitian conjugate partners within the same group. A simple action for massless fermion and boson fields describes all the fields uniquely. The paper overviews the theory, presents new achievements and discusses the open problems of this theory.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the phase space of the soft sector of asymptotically flat gravity in four spacetime dimensions can be identified with that of a spherically symmetric finite casual diamond in Minkowski spacetime. The leading soft graviton mode is identified with the radial fluctuation of the causal diamond size, while the Goldstone mode involves both the radial fluctuation and its symplectic partner. This allows us to relate the radial fluctuations of the causal diamond with the asymptotic transverse fluctuations parametrized by the soft modes.

### [113] [Asymptotic Behavior of Diagram Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09042)
*Luen Clingerman,Matthew D. Schwartz*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the asymptotic behavior of perturbative expansions in quantum field theory (QFT), focusing on factorial growth in the number of Feynman diagrams. It reviews the Hopf algebra approach and shows how analytic QFT techniques can yield similar results. The authors present a method to extract asymptotic behavior and generalize the analysis of Hopf series to other diagram classes. They also address whether these classes correspond to new types of asymptotic growth beyond instantons and renormalons, concluding that these classes are incomplete calculations of renormalons if all diagrams were included. The paper concludes that while the Hopf algebra approach is useful for certain insights, analytic QFT techniques remain essential for understanding asymptotic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the asymptotic behavior of perturbative expansions in QFT is crucial for making sense of quantum field theories and their predictions. This paper contributes to that understanding by exploring different approaches and clarifying the role of Hopf algebras in the context of QFT.

Method: The paper employs a combination of mathematical techniques, including the use of Hopf algebras, Schwinger-Dyson equations, and Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebras, along with analytic QFT methods, to analyze the asymptotic behavior of Feynman diagrams in various theories such as φ³ theory.

Result: The authors demonstrate that the Hopf algebra approach and analytic QFT techniques are complementary in studying the asymptotic behavior of perturbative expansions. They generalize previous results to a broader class of diagrams and clarify the relationship between different types of asymptotic growth in QFT. They also conclude that certain diagram classes exhibit behavior similar to renormalons but are not new types of asymptotic growth.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a connection between Hopf algebras and quantum field theory, showing that both approaches are valuable for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of perturbative expansions. It also underscores the importance of considering all Feynman diagrams to fully understand the asymptotic behavior of QFT.

Abstract: The asymptotic nature of perturbative expansions in quantum field theory can arise from the factorial growth in the number of Feynman diagrams with loop order, as with instantons, or from a series of individual diagrams whose values grow factorially, as with renormalon chains in QED. Other classes of diagrams are known also to grow factorially, such as the Hopf series of graphs in $φ^3$ theory. This Hopf series was studied using Schwinger-Dyson equations and the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of decorated rooted trees. We review the Hopf algebra approach and show that the same results can be obtained using analytic QFT techniques as with Hopf-algebraic ones. We present an efficient method to extract the asymptotic behavior and thereby generalize the analysis of the Hopf series to other classes of diagrams in other theories. We confront the question of whether these classes correspond to new types of asymptotic growth beyond instantons and renormalons, and find that they appear to be incomplete calculations of what would be renormalons in these theories if all diagrams were included. Although the Hopf algebra approach is not essential to deriving asymptotic behavior from Schwinger-Dyson equations, it does provide some other insights into quantum field theory. We therefore attempt also to provide a map between some relevant aspects of the Hopf algebra and quantum field theory.

Result: 预计有大量十 Screening右中微粒存在于 keV 质量区间，以及不带电的重中微粒与暗能量标度齐平。

Conclusion: 该模型可能解释了微粒物理中的几大问题，并为实验提供了可能的观察目标。

Abstract: We consider realizations of a gauged B-L symmetry in the context of the Dark Dimension scenario, where the SM lives on a codimension one brane in 5d spacetime. The B-L can naturally be a bulk gauge symmetery leading to a global symmetry on the SM brane, and have its gauge anomaly canceled by charged bulk modes. This naturally leads to the existence of 3 right-handed neutrinos propagating in the dark dimension. Allowing for Higgsing of B-L by a bulk scalar at the Higgs scale, results in a massive gauge field with $m_{B-L}\sim 100$ GeV and weak coupling $g_{B-L}\sim 10^{-10}$ which is allowed by current bounds. The model also predicts a natural matching $m_ν\sim m_{KK}\simΛ^{1/4}$, thereby providing a theoretical explanation for the observed coincidence between neutrino masses and the Dark Energy scale. It also predicts a tower of sterile right-handed neutrinos in the $keV$ mass range.

Conclusion: 该研究通过在标准超级帕提-萨拉姆模型中引入额外的 D6-膜，成功提出了新的三家族超级帕提-萨拉姆模型，并为这些模型提出了更复杂的规范结构和发展优势。

Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.

Abstract: In this paper, we create a Mellin space method for boundary correlation functions in de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces. We demonstrate that the analytic continuation between AdS${}_{d+1}$ and dS${}_{d+1}$ is encoded in a set of simple relative phases using the Mellin-Barnes representation of correlators. It helps us to determine the scalar three-point and four-point functions and their corresponding Mellin-Barnes amplitudes in dS${}_{d+1}$ space using the known results from AdS${}_{d+1}$ space. The Mellin-Barnes representation reveals the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions over all $d$ and scaling dimensions. In the present discussion, the {\it split representation} have been used as an instrumental technique in particularly the evaluation of bulk Witten diagrams and is suitable to obtain the {\it Conformal Partial Wave decomposition} of tree-level exchange in the bulk Witten diagrams. The equivalent adjustment to the cosmological three-point and four-point function of generic external scalars may be further extracted from these results, assuming the weak breakdown of the de Sitter isometries. These findings offer a step towards a more methodical comprehension of de Sitter observables utilising Mellin space techniques at the tree level and beyond.

Abstract: Rotating black holes when attached to a cosmic string have their rotational energy extracted leading to a change in its spin and mass. The spin of a black hole can be measured using various methods for an accreting black hole in an X-ray binary system. Accretion disks around black holes have an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) whose location is directly dependent on spin and mass of the black hole. The orbit's location changes as the black hole's spin changes and hence can be a method to detect the presence of cosmic strings. This study investigates this change and suggests the ejection of accretion material as black hole spin approaches maximum for prograde motion and material falling into the black hole for retrograde motion, regardless of the presence of cosmic string. However, in the presence of cosmic string, the spin-up process due to accretion is found out to be slower, even with high accretion rates and is detectable. There is a transition phase that occurs as the black hole approaches maximum spin, where even small changes in spin result in significant changes in the ISCO's position. Accreting black holes attached to a large string never reach this transition phase and this absence serves as potential evidence for the existence of a cosmic string.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this article we calculate the eikonal scattering amplitude for an arbitrary number of in- and out-particles, using covariant quantization in a spherical harmonics basis on the Schwarzschild background. We extend prior results to resummation over all partial waves, restoring contributions from transverse separation and correctly taking into account the particle masses in the pole structure. We consider leading order interactions mediated by scalar-scalar-graviton vertices and scalar electrodynamics. We perform our calculations in the black hole eikonal phase. The $2\to 2$ eikonal amplitude is measured by the transverse Green's function $(-Δ_Ω+a)G(Ω,Ω')=δ^{(2)}(Ω-Ω')$. As a consistency check, we use our formalism in flat space to find an exact match with the known flat space eikonal $2\to 2$ amplitude in literature. We then extend the eikonal amplitude to arbitrarily many particles for the first time in both flat space and on the black hole background. We show that the black hole amplitude matches the black hole S-matrix as derived by 't Hooft. We conclude that this amplitude provides the most general elastic contribution one can achieve in the eikonal phase.

Abstract: We study an analogue information paradox in acoustic black holes which are emerged from the superfluid surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting acoustic black hole contains both acoustic horizons and optical horizon, with analogue Hawking radiation, i.e. phonons, emitted from the outer acoustic horizon. By using the island formula, we calculate the entanglement entropy of analogue Hawking radiation of the acoustic black hole in both non-extremal and extremal cases. In the non-extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons follow the Page curve due to the emergence of islands, and it is approximately proportional to the area of the acoustic horizon at late time. While in the extremal case, the entanglement entropy of phonons diverges, leading to an ill-defined Page time. Our study verifies the unitarity of the analogue gravity system, and provides further insight into the connection between the entanglement entropy and the causal structure of spacetime.

Abstract: We consider the case of a free real massive bulk scalar in D=4 dimensions, and embed two parallel plates as interfaces on which we impose non-linear boundary conditions, either Dirichlet- or Neumann-like, parameterized by a new coupling constant g. This mimics a non-Abelian gauge theory supplemented with boundary conditions on surfaces embedded in the bulk. We present the first evidence for a non-perturbative 1/g^2 boundary mass generation and its ensuing correction to the standard Casimir energy. This becomes possible by incorporating dynamical corrections to the effective boundary fields, which are used to build in the boundary conditions directly at the action level.

Method: The authors analyze the symbol letters of general massless scattering amplitudes and their connection to cluster variables of partial flag varieties. They use zigzag diagrams to express split-helicity amplitudes in closed form and conjecture the cluster adjacency under arc permutations of the zigzag diagrams.

Abstract: Recent work has uncovered a connection between the symbol letters of general massless scattering and (permutations of) cluster variables of partial flag varieties. In this paper we explore the cluster adjacency of tree-level gluon amplitudes, specifically focusing on split-helicity amplitudes which can be written in closed form in terms of zigzag diagrams. We check in several cases, and conjecture in general, that the poles in each term satisfy cluster adjacency under a set of permutations that is built from arc permutations of the corresponding zigzag.

Motivation: 受膜版弱引力猜想的启发，研究非阿贝尔区域膜在AdSd空穴流中的解，旨在发现新类型的解以突破只能通过阿贝尔解破坏的情况。

Method: 通过假设面动量为常数，并将标量的运动方程转换为与Lie代数相关的代数问题，找到精确解。然后将这些解嵌入AdSd空穴中。

Result: 在AdSd空穴中，存在计算出的两种膜，但只有内部膜可以存在于无法通过Abelian膜破坏的空穴中。计算表明，这种非Abelian膜比原来好吧得多。在一个具体的AdS空穴部分过程中，某些空穴本就是被Abelian膜解动态破坏的，但这里发现了能够反而稳定的空穴。

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔膜和其扩展可能是超过和稳定于某些预想着它们总是越来越大的阿贝尔膜的情况。这一发现极大地扩大了抗阿电荷稳定性的空穴的能力，这意味着AdS空间的稳定性和内置于需要避免膜的波动信息的更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate non-abelian branes in curved space. We discuss solutions to the equations of motion of the transverse scalars when they are constant along the world-volume directions and obey an $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ or an $\mathfrak{su}(2)\oplus\mathfrak{su}(2)$ algebra. Motivated by the membrane version of the weak gravity conjecture, we specialise our results to non-abelian domain-wall D$(d-2)$ branes embedded in AdS$_d$ flux vacua. We find that they can be less self-attractive than their abelian counterpart, opening up a new decay-channel for vacua that resist all abelian domain-wall destabilisations. These branes come in two types, depending on whether their fuzziness involves the radial direction, or is purely internal. Only the latter can develop in vacua free from abelian decays. We illustrate our construction by embedding these branes in a variety of AdS vacua, destabilising some of them.

Abstract: We consider the string-theory inspired Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton theory (EMMD) and show that we can derive the complete set of thermodynamic quantities of charged black holes, without having to solve for the black hole solutions. We argue that the technique can be applied more broadly to string theories, providing an accessible method for determining the thermodynamic properties of large classes of black holes for which exact solutions are typically unavailable.

Abstract: Quantum point contacts (QPC) are a key instrument in investigating the physics of edge excitations in the quantum Hall effect. However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables.

Abstract: Quantum geometric formulations of linear and nonlinear responses can be constructed from a single building block in the form of a gauge-invariant interband transition operator. Here, we identify a second building block for quantum geometry: a band-resolved adiabatic connection operator that captures the noncommutativity between band projectors and their momentum derivatives. The band-resolved adiabatic connection operator, first introduced in the theory of adiabatic driving, serves as a generalized angular momentum within the state manifold of single bands, and we employ it to reformulate expressions for the band-resolved orbital magnetic moment. This form provides a complementary geometric interpretation alongside the multiband separation between energetic- and quantum-state properties by the two-state Berry curvature. Our formalism allows us to present formulas valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate bands, thereby removing the limitations of the common Bloch-state formula. We illustrate our theory by calculating a large orbital magnetization emerging without spin-orbit coupling in a spin-compensated, noncoplanar anomalous Hall magnet with degenerate bands.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了对不规则对称条件下的量子点光电子行为的理解，并揭示了壳层的影响机制和三子状态行为的决定因素。

Abstract: The energy levels and optical transitions of tetrahedral core/shell InP/ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) are investigated by means of multi-band k$\cdot$p theory. Despite the $\overline{T}_d$ symmetry relaxing spherical selection rules, the near-band-edge excitonic spectrum is reminiscent of that obtained for spherical nanocrystals. Exceptions appear in large (red-emitting) QDs, where transitions violating the (quasi-)angular momentum selection rule ($ΔL=0,\pm 2$) are observed, and the ground state does not become dark ($P_{3/2}$-like). Valence band coupling is important in determining the symmetry, degeneracy and energy of hole states, with split-off holes playing a greater role than in CdSe QDs. The ($1S_e$-like) electron ground state exhibits moderate delocalization into the ZnSe shell. The confinement regime is then strong even for thick shells, which results in Coulomb interactions being mostly perturbative. Electrons remain largely localized in the InP core even in negative trions, despite electron-electron repulsions. At the same time, the asymmetry between Coulomb attractions and repulsions leads to negative (positive) trions being bound (antibound) by tens of meV. The biexciton binding energy switches from positive to negative, depending on the QD size.

Abstract: We report a symmetry-resolved study of longitudinal magnetoelastoresistance (MER) in the multivalley material bismuth, with the current, uniaxial stress, and magnetic field all applied along the binary axis. The magnitude of MER exhibits a steep increase at low magnetic fields, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases at higher fields. By decomposing the strain response into symmetric and antisymmetric symmetry channels, we reveal contrasting magnetic field dependencies. Despite the overall non-monotonic field dependence of the MER, the symmetric component remains nearly constant under magnetic fields, suggesting that the valleys in bismuth preserve a rigid-band nature against strain even in the presence of a magnetic field. In contrast, the antisymmetric component, associated with mobility anisotropy, dominates the MER response in a magnetic field. At low magnetic fields, the applied field effectively modifies the apparent mobility of each valley, leading to an enhancement in the magnitude of the antisymmetric MER. At higher fields, field-induced valley polarization further modifies this mobility anisotropy by altering the contributions from each valley's mobility, accounting for the moderate suppression of the MER. These findings demonstrate that symmetry-resolved MER serves as a powerful probe of valley-dependent electronic states and provides a fundamental platform for understanding the interplay between magnetic field, strain, and charge transport.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, renowned for their fascinating electromagnetic properties, hold potential for next-generation topological spintronic devices. Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices.

Abstract: Topological magnetic solitons have emerged as promising candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices, thanks to their fascinating electromagnetic properties. For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating. Our results hold potential for advancing antiskyrmion-based device applications.

Motivation:  skyrmions are promising for next-generation memory devices due to their potential for ultra-high density and switching reliability. this paper addresses the challenge of reliably manipulating individual skyrmions.

Method:  the researchers used in-plane current in nanostructured cuboids of fe3sn2, leveraging surface spin twists and dipolar interactions. they combined experimental results with 3d micromagnetic simulations.

Result:  they achieved reversible creation and deletion of skyrmions, even without artificial defects. the skyrmion creation is due to spin-transfer torque from the ferromagnetic dipole-dipole interaction. deletions result from a combination of magnetic hysteresis and joule heating.

Conclusion:  this method provides a reliable way to perform single-bit operations in skyrmionic devices, paving the way for applications like racem.

Abstract: We report deterministic operations on single dipolar skyrmions confined in nanostructured cuboids using in-plane currents. We achieve highly reversible writing and deleting of skyrmions in the simple cuboid without any artificial defects or pinning sites. The current-induced creation of skyrmions is well-understood through the spin-transfer torque acting on surface spin twists of the spontaneous 3D ferromagnetic state, caused by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction of the uniaxial Fe3Sn2 magnet with a low-quality factor. Current-induced deletions of skyrmions result from the combined effects of magnetic hysteresis and Joule thermal heating. Our results are replicated consistently through 3D micromagnetic simulations. Our approach offers a viable method for achieving reliable single-bit operations in skyrmionic devices for applications such as random-access memories.

Abstract: We analyze the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of two or three electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to ab extended band states of a quantum dot using a simple model. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent problem has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Within this model, we study the time evolution of the electron occupancies of conduction and valence bands and the trap state, as well as the statistical factors influencing light emission of different energies. In most of the analyzed cases, the system dynamics has a very short transient determined by the hopping parameters, that can be of tens of femptoseconds,followed by a quasi-stationary regime in which the electron occupancies either oscillate periodically around their time-averaged values or remain nearly constant. We find signatures of strong electronic correlations in the electronic motion for negative values of the effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction that are not translated to the statistical factors for light emission. Our calculations show that light emission of different energies is always possible except in the especial cases in which the valence band is initially filled with two electrons. In these cases the valence band can lose and recover electrons periodically but exciton emission is negligible at any time. We use this fact to attempt to give a possible explanation for the increase in the intensity of exciton emission with the concomitant decrease in the intensity of the green emission lines upon continuous illumination with ultraviolet radiation, experimentally observed for ZnO nanoparticles suspended in an alcohol.

Abstract: This study establishes a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings. We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of strain-mediated control in three-dimensional magnetic systems, demonstrating its feasibility for energy-efficient spintronic applications.

Abstract: In a structure with two tunnel-coupled quantum wells of different widths, the spin dynamics resulting from resonant pulsed optical pumping of the narrow-well exciton includes the wide-well electron magnetization dynamics. Our analysis shows that the effect is driven by electron exchange between narrow-well excitons and spin-polarized electrons in the wide well. A theoretical model of the spin Kerr effect has been developed accounting for the interwell electron spin exchange. In the studied double-well structure with CdTe and Cd$_{0.98}$Mn$_{0.02}$Te quantum wells and a well-separating barrier thickness of 5 monolayers (1.6 nm), the model accurately describes the experimental results and allows us to estimate the interwell electron exchange constant as $δ_{e} \approx 0.9\times10^{-15}~\textrm{eV}~\textrm{cm}^{2}$.

Result:  TiI₂ 的基态激发态是明亮的，且有两个关键机制：第一，自旋轨道效应导致的能带分裂，允许电子和空穴在 Brillouin 区域的大部分区域发生光 allowed 自旋配对，从而避免与 K 点附近类似 MoSe₂ 这样的材料出现的能带交叉现象。第二，足够的弱交换相互作用使得明亮激发态在能量上保持在暗激发态之下。此外，研究还表明，在机械应变下，亮基态激发态保持稳定，而受激发电荷态（trion）也继承了这一亮基态特征。

Conclusion: 这些发现为探索具有类似特征的二色体材料提供了新的方向，而具有明亮基态激发态的材料在需要快速发光再结合的光电子应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Based on \textit{ab initio} screened configuration interaction calculations we find that TiI$_2$ has a bright exciton ground state and identify two key mechanisms that lead to this unprecedented feature among transition metal dichalcogenides. First, the spin-orbit induced conduction band splitting results in optically allowed spin-alignment for electrons and holes across a significant portion of the Brillouin zone around the $\mathbf{K}$-valley, avoiding band crossings seen in materials like monolayer MoSe$_2$. Second, a sufficiently weak exchange interaction ensures that the bright exciton remains energetically below the dark exciton state. We further show that the bright exciton ground state is stable under various mechanical strains and that trion states (charged excitons) inherit this bright ground state. Our findings are expected to spark further investigation into related materials that bring along the two key features mentioned, as bright ground-state excitons are crucial for applications requiring fast radiative recombination.

Abstract: Massless Dirac particles avoid trapping due to their exceptional tunneling properties manifested in the so-called Klein paradox. This conclusion stems from the conservative treatment, but so far, it has not been extended to a non-Hermitian framework. Recently, driven-dissipative bosonic condensation of Dirac exciton-polaritons was demonstrated in metasurface waveguides. Here, we report an experimental observation of spatial binding and energy quantization of Dirac exciton-polaritons in a halide perovskite metasurface. A combination of spatially profiled nonresonant optical excitation and exciton-polariton interaction forms an effective non-Hermitian complex potential responsible for the observed effect. In the case of tightly focused pump spots spanning from 9 to 17~$μ$m, several bound states simultaneously achieve macroscopic occupation, constituting a multi-mode bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons. Our theoretical analysis based on the driven-dissipative extension of the Dirac equation reveals that the non-Hermitian character of the effective trap allows for confinement even in the case of the gapless Dirac-like photonic dispersion, both above and below the energy of the dispersion crossing.

The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.

Abstract: In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intemediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be infered through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentialy the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dialate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguements for the general case.

Abstract: Motivated by recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we analyze the temperature, frequency, and momentum dependence of the single-particle scattering rate in a model of the $γ$-band of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under strain, with particular emphasis on the behavior near the Lifshitz transition where the Fermi energy crosses a single Van Hove point. While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $τ^{-1}\sim ω$ at the Van Hove point and as $τ^{-1}\sim ω^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $ω^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $τ^{-1} \sim ω^α$ with $α\approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law. We further predict a distinctive anisotropy, strain dependence, and a non-monotonic frequency dependence of the scattering rate at a Lifshitz transition, all of which may be directly tested in experiments.

Abstract: Using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate the interplay between doping, inter-layer tunneling and onsite Hund's coupling in stabilizing superconductivity (SC) in a two-orbital model for the bilayer Nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$. With realistic dispersion and for certain values of the interaction parameters, the auxiliary-field-decoupled fermion Hamiltonian has Kramers anti-unitary symmetries which guarantee the absence of a sign problem. The same anti-unitary symmetries can also be used to show there is a second instability towards $(π,π)$ exciton condensation in the strong interaction limit. We indicate the possible connection between this exciton order and the enigmatic density wave state observed in experiment, and clarify the decisive role played by the inter-layer tunneling in the competition between SC and exciton condensation. Finally, possible directions on how to enhance the SC transition temperature and stabilize the SC phase are also discussed.

Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain compounds with spin-orbit coupling that goes beyond the phenomenological site-dependent $g$-tensor description traditionally used for XXZ-like BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ and related materials. Starting from the symmetry-allowed $JKΓ$ Hamiltonian with Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal $Γ$ interactions, we show that the $Γ$ interaction naturally generates the four-sublattice pattern associated with the crystal's screw symmetry. Using the density matrix renormalization group, we identify two distinct field-induced transitions. The first is a continuous transition into an intermediate phase, where the symmetry responsible for the two-fold ground-state degeneracy is broken. The second is a first-order transition into the high-field phase, characterized by a discontinuous jump in the spin-spin correlator. Entanglement-entropy scaling confirms that the first transition belongs to the Ising critical point with the central charge $1/2$. These results establish a microscopic framework for pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain systems such as Co$^{2+}$ materials, uncover an intermediate phase whose width increases with $Γ$, and provide guidance for systematic exploration of additional field orientations and structural distortions.

Abstract: We propose a protocol to construct atypical high-energy eigenstates in quantum systems by using ground states of Hamiltonians deformed by conserved charges. For the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain we study a chiral Hamiltonian built from the scalar-chirality charge and total magnetization and solve it exactly by Bethe ansatz. Its ground state is a magnetized, current-carrying XXX eigenstate that breaks SU(2), time-reversal, and parity yet stays critical. This zero-entropy macrostate shows ballistic spin and chirality transport and admits realistic cold-atom and Rydberg platforms.

Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $π$-shifted (ISD-$π$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$π$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$π$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$π$ patches.

Abstract: The hole-doped manganite (La$_{1-y}$Pr$_{y}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LPCMO) shows electronic phase separation between ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) and anti-ferromagnetic charge-ordered insulating (AFM-COI) regions. In this study, (La$_{0.5}$Pr$_{0.5}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LP5CMO) microstructures were fabricated using photolithography on thin films grown on (110) NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. We investigated the domain reversal mechanism of these microstructures through magnetotransport measurements. Our results demonstrate that, while bulk (unpatterned) films follow the standard Kondorsky model for domain reversal, the microstructures obey a modified Kondorsky model. This difference indicates that local magnetic fields from reversed domains significantly influence the coercive field in confined geometries. Although we did not observe a strong electric field effect, this study establishes that magnetotransport measurements are a feasible method for probing the competition between shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in manganite microstructures, which could provide an alternative path for controlling magnetic domains at low current densities.

Abstract: Quantum materials near electronic or magnetic phase boundaries exhibit enhanced tunability, as their emergent properties become highly sensitive to external perturbations. Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials.

Abstract: We study the electric and thermoelectric transport through a spinful complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) quantum dot coupled to metallic leads, forming a N-SYK-N junction, by the Keldysh field theory approach. Unlike traditional equilibrium approaches, our formulation treats the system as an open, interacting quantum conductor under non-equilibrium conditions, without resorting to the replica trick. Starting from the exact Keldysh-Dyson equations, we derive analytical results for the tunneling and zero-temperature limits and perform a numerical analysis in the linear-response regime. We characterize the dependence of conductance, thermoelectric coefficient, and Seebeck effect on the particle-hole asymmetry parameter and coupling strength to the leads. Our results reveal distinctive non-Fermi liquid signatures of the SYK model in transport properties and identify coupling regimes where thermoelectric effects are enhanced, suggesting experimentally accessible fingerprints of SYK physics in mesoscopic systems.

Abstract: The square-kagome lattice, composed of two-dimensional corner-sharing triangles, provides a novel platform for studying frustrated magnetism. However, material realizations of the square-kagome lattice remain scarce. Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic transition.The formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra. These results suggest that a three-dimensional model incorporating interlayer couplings via decorating sites is essential for capturing the magnetic and electric behaviors in KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the magnetic properties of spinel compounds MnSc₂X₄ with X=S and Se, and discovers that MnS can exhibit Skyrmion magnetic states, which are absent in MnSe. The authors observe clear antiferromagnetic ordering in MnS and evidence of magnetoelastic coupling. The phase diagrams, characterized by thermal and mechanical measurements, reveal distinct magnetic behaviors between MnS and MnSe, suggesting that the ligand's electronic and structural properties significantly influence Skyrmion formation and magnetic ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The investigation into Skyrmion magnetic states in ion-rich spinel compounds, such as MnSc₂S₄ and MnSc₂Se₄, is driven by the potential for developing novel magnetic materials for spintronics applications. The presence of Skyrmion states in MnS suggests their existence in strongly frustrated magnetic systems, which have garnered considerable interest due to their potential for exotic quantum phenomena and applications in data storage and quantum computation. The uncertainty regarding MnSe's magnetic behavior poses a key focus, and the motivation is to unravel the conditions necessary for Skyrmion formation and stabilize them thermally in these materials

Method: The study employs synchrotron-based techniques, including synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction, time-resolved X-ray diffraction, and neutron scattering. Ultrasound and dilatometry measurements are used to extract a phase diagram, including magnetic transitions at different temperatures. A model based on spin-wave approximation and Monte Carlo simulations is developed to explain the experimental observations. In-situ measurements of specific heat, ac-susceptibility, and magnetostriction are also performed to characterize the magnetic and thermal properties of the materials.

Result: The key results include the observation of Skyrmion magnetic states in MnS, which are absent in MnSe. MnS exhibits Skyrmion phases at low temperatures, alongside antiferromagnetic ordering at high temperatures, and shows magnetoelastic coupling. MnSe, on the other hand, lacks the Skyrmion phase and exhibits minimal magnetoelastic coupling, with no clear phase transitions observed in thermal or mechanical measurements. Additionally, the model successfully predicts the experimental magnetostriction and specific-heat behaviors of both materials, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding their distinct magnetic properties

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the magnetic properties of MnSc₂S₄ and MnSc₂Se₄. The discovery of Skyrmion states in MnS and the lack thereof in MnSe is a significant finding that could guide the development of new Skyrmion-based materials. Furthermore, the elucidation of the effects of ligand substitution onSkyrmion formation and stability through experimental and theoretical approaches paves the way for exploring other materials in this class for potential applications in ultrafast electronics and quantum information processing.

Abstract: The spinel compounds MnSc_2X_4 are highly frustrated and candidate materials for vortex-like 3q magnetic states, such as skyrmions, with propagation vectors in the [111] plane. Because of the strong magnetoelastic coupling, we could extract a refined magnetic (H, T) phase diagram for MnSc_2S_4 from ultrasound and dilatometry measurements. We found a variety of magnetic phases, including the skyrmion phase, which is stable down to lowest temperatures. In comparison, we investigated MnSc_2Se_4 , having a larger distance between the magnetic Mn^3+ ions using the same methods. Unlike in MnSc_2S_4 , we found no skyrmion phase and overall a lack of sharp anomalies indicative of phase transitions, neither in dilatometry nor ultrasound nor in specific heat and ac-susceptibility data. Motivated by our findings, we performed model calculations, which reproduced the experimentally observed magnetostriction and specific-heat results reasonably well.
