Abstract: Strongly correlated quantum materials exhibit a rich landscape of ordered phases with highly tunable properties, making them an intriguing platform for exploring non-equilibrium phenomena. A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了非互惠效应在磁性材料中的存在范围，特别是在高动量区域。所观察到的浅阻尼磁激发现象为紧凑型、高频磁性应用提供了新方向，同时为理论模型的完善提供了重要证据。

Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering in the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ reveals strong non-reciprocal effects on magnon propagation at the boundary of the nuclear Brillouin zone. The non-reciprocal response is strongest at a central position between the zone corner and edge mid-point. We explain these results using an effective linear spin-wave model. While directional effects in chiral magnets have so far only been known to exist at low momenta close to the center of the Brillouin zone, the present study shows that non-reciprocity persists at the highest possible reduced momenta. The observed magnons show very little damping within the limits of our experimental resolution, making them of great interest for the fundamental research on compact, high-frequency magnonic applications.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetic structure evolution across the spin reorientation transition in orthorhombic (Pnma) TmCrO3. Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point. Anomalies in the lattice parameters reveal strong magnetoelastic coupling, linking structural distortions to the SRO.

TL;DR: Kagome metals can host unconventional electronic phenomena emerging from their geometry. Time-reversal symmetry breaking may account for observed effects in TbV6Sn6, despite no obvious lattice distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding unconventional electronic phenomena in kagome metals, especially mechanisms leading to symmetry breaking and coexistence with magnetic orders.

Method: Neutron scattering and first-principles calculations were used to analyze the symmetry-broken phase and magnetic coupling in TbV6Sn6.

Result: Time-reversal symmetry breaking, encoded by rare-earth local moments, explains the observed magnetic splitting without lattice distortions.

Conclusion: Established Tb moments as a key factor in symmetry-breaking effects in kagome metals, opening new research directions.

Abstract: Kagome metals can host unconventional electronic phenomena that emerge from their frustrated lattice geometry and associated band topology. Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism.

Abstract: A major challenge in condensed matter physics is integrating topological phenomena with correlated electron physics to leverage both types of states for next-generation quantum devices. Metal-insulator transitions (MITs) are central to bridging these two domains while simultaneously serving as 'on-off' switches for electronic states. Here, we demonstrate how the prototypical material of K2Cr8O16 undergoes a ferromagnetic MIT accompanied by a change in band topology. Through inelastic x-ray and neutron scattering experiments combined with first-principles theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that this transition is not driven by a Peierls mechanism, given the lack of phonon softening. Instead, we establish the transition as a topological MIT within the ferromagnetic phase (topological-FM-MIT) with potential axionic properties, where electron correlations play a key role in stabilizing the insulating state. This work pioneers the discovery of a topological-FM-MIT and represents a fundamentally new class of topological phase transitions, revealing a unique pathway through which magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations interact.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To clarify the origin of the pseudogap and strange metal states as well as their mutual relationship in cuprate superconductors, a comprehensive study on the spectral function, Fermi surface, resistivity and dynamical spin susceptivity of the Hubbard model on the square lattice has been conducted by means of the ladder dual-fermion approximation with an electron self-energy correction. It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled.

### [7] [Growth-Controlled Twinning and Magnetic Anisotropy in CeSb$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08176)
*Jan T. Weber,Kristin Kliemt,Sergey L. Bud'ko,Paul C. Canfield,Cornelius Krellner*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: CeSb₂ is a heavy-fermion Kondo lattice with complex magnets and pressure-induced superconductivity. In-plane anisotropy is influenced by structural twinning, but controlled crystal growth resolves discrepancies in earlier studies.

motivation: Understanding the in-plane magnetic anisotropy in CeSb₂ is crucial given its structural complexity and its implications for heavy-fermion physics and superconductivity.

method: Mixed crystal growth techniques, including controlled flux and cooling, combined with magnetization and rotational magnetometry, were used to study twinning effects.

result: The single crystals exhibit intrinsic in-plane anisotropy with an easy axis saturation magnetization of 1.8 μ_B/Ce, and a reduced hard axis magnetization. Growth conditions systematically reduce twinning, but no β phase is conclusively identified.

Motivation: Understanding the in-plane magnetic anisotropy in CeSb₂ is required for comprehending its structural and physical properties.

method): The research employs mixed crystal growth techniques, including controlled flux and cooling, to systematically reduce structural twinning.

result): Intrinsic in-plane anisotropy is observed with specific magnetization characteristics.

conclusion): Single crystals consistently show expected behaviors despite initial discrepancies in magnetic measurements.

Method: The research employs controlled crystal growth techniques with Sb-rich flux and slower cooling to minimize structural twinning.

Result: The single crystals exhibit intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at M(easy)(4T) ≈ 1.8 μ_B/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response.

Conclusion: The study provides a consistent magnetic phase diagram for CeSb₂, advancing understanding of interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb₂.

Abstract: Cerium diantimonide (CeSb$_2$) is a layered heavy-fermion Kondo lattice material that hosts complex magnetism and pressure-induced superconductivity. The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\text{easy}}(4~\text{T}) \approx 1.8~μ_{\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $α$-$β$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $β$ phase. Our results establish a consistent magnetic phase diagram and provide essential constraints for crystal-electric field models, enabling a clearer understanding of the interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb$_2$.

Motivation: This paper investigates the quantum spin Hall effect in the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with competing interactions, inspired by recent experiments on layered vanadium compounds. The motivation stems from understanding the interplay between geometry, spin interactions, and electronic structure in determining exotic quantum phases. The work aims to explore how the triangular geometry and strong anisotropy in the exchange couplings give rise to robust topological states, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, which have not been fully characterized in such systems before.

Method: The authors employ a series of theoretical methods, starting from the $1/S$ expansion to construct an effective low-energy theory of the system. They map the original spin model onto a hard-core boson model with quartic interactions on the honeycomb lattice. This effective model is then solved using a self-consistent renormalization approach to calculate the single-particle self-energy, capturing the essential physics at different scales. Numerical methods include exact diagonalization on small clusters and a variety of Monte Carlo simulations to study the quantum phase diagram and analyze experimental observations.

Result: In the strong easy-axis anisotropic regime, the Triangular lattice Heisenberg model can be mapped to an effective XY-model on a honeycomb lattice. The effective theory reveals a rich phase structure comprising a spin-wave phase, a weakly interacting Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, and a strong-interaction quantum critical point. The monopole fermions, which are the emergent excitations in the effective model, exhibit robust behavior that gives rise to a pronounced even-odd effect in the bulk gap across the quantum critical point. The analysis of the spectrum using self-energy calculations at one-loop order reveals intricate scale-dependent behaviors. Various experimental signatures are discussed, which are compared with the results from K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, a material known for exhibiting similar quantum magnetic behavior.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of combining theoretical and experimental approaches to advance our understanding of quantum geometric effects in spin-lattice systems. It highlights the role of the triangular lattice and strong anisotropy in stabilizing exotic quantum phases, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, and calls for further experimental and theoretical studies to explore these phenomena in real materials.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental studies, we investigate the spectrum of the nearest-neighbour triangular XXZ model within the $1/S$ expansion, in the limit in which the exchange couplings present a strong easy-axis anisotropy $J_{xy}/J_{zz} \ll 1$. We show that in the limit in which $1/S \to 0$ and $J_{xy} \to 0$ at fixed $V = J_{zz}/(S J_{xy})$, the triangular spin model can be reduced to an effective boson model with quartic interactions on the honeycomb lattice. This effective model interpolates between a spin-wave ($V \to 0$) and a strong-coupling limit ($V \to \infty$), and encodes in a simple framework the regimes discussed by Kleine et al. [Z. Phys. B Condens. Matter 86, 405 (1992); 87, 103 (1992)]. For zero field, the classical ground state of the model presents an accidental degeneracy, which has a particularly simple form and which can be expressed in terms of a simple symmetry of the classical energy. The model thus offers a particularly transparent realization of a theory with quantum order-by-disorder and a pseudo-Goldstone mode. We analyze the spectrum at zero magnetic field by calculating the self-energy at one-loop order, using a self-consistent renormalization of the gap and the energy scale. Within the self-consistent approximation considered here, the corrections present a complex evolution as a function of $V$. We discuss the one-loop corrections in comparison with the spectrum observed experimentally in K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了Meissner效应的概念，并在ħ的相变和极化子行为中发现了新的特性，为光诱导的顺序特别是超导体的实验提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a relativistic, parametrically driven O($N$)-symmetric theory coupled to a Markovian thermal bath. Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity.

Abstract: This work explores the use of polarization-resolved high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy to investigate the quantum phases and transitions in the correlated charge density wave (CDW) phase of TiSe$_2$. Unlike previous studies focusing on crystallographic changes, the research examines the reordering that occurs within the CDW phase as the material is cooled from room temperature to 14 K. By linking ultrafast field-driven dynamics to the material's potential landscape, the study demonstrates how HHG is sensitive to quantum phase transitions. The findings reveal an anisotropic component below the CDW transition temperature, providing new insights into the nature of this phase. The investigation highlights the interplay between linear and nonlinear optical responses and their departure from simple perturbative dynamics, offering a fresh perspective on correlated quantum phases in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: Nonlocality shapes quantum correlations, revealed through the violation of Bell inequalities. The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, a technique known as quantum symmetry test has gained increasing attention for detecting bipartite entanglement in pure quantum states. In this work we show that, beyond qualitative detection, a family of well-defined measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement can be obtained with symmetry tests. We propose and benchmark several efficient methods to estimate these measures, and derive near-optimal sampling strategies for each. Despite the nonlinearity of the methods, we demonstrate that the sampling error scales no worse than $O(N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/2})$ with the total number of copies $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$, which suggests experimental feasibility. By exploiting symmetries we compute our measures for large number of copies, and derive the asymptotic decay exponents for relevant states in many-body systems. Using these results we identify tradeoffs between estimation complexity and sensitivity of the presented entanglement measures, oriented to practical implementations.

Abstract: A shortcut-to-adiabaticity is compared with a numerically optimized protocol for implementing a high-fidelity quantum gate on Rydberg atoms. The counterdiabatic method offers an analytical framework for accelerating high-fidelity gates by mimicking the time evolution of a counterdiabatic Hamiltonian using fast-oscillating fields. This approach is contrasted with a numerically optimized gate designed using the Boulder Opal platform. The numerically optimized gate achieves higher fidelities while demonstrating robustness against errors similar to that of the effective counterdiabatic gate. The study serves as an example of the performance of analytic shortcut-to-adiabatic-inspired protocols compared to brute-force numerical optimization techniques for state-of-the-art quantum computing platforms. It stresses the important role played by constraints on the optimized pulses in time and in amplitude that are crucial in determining the quality of the optimization method.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the ability of the double-Morse potential for generating non-Gaussian quantum states, using analytical methods to derive ground state wave functions and energy spectra as a function of asymmetry parameter α. The non-Gaussianity and non-classicality increase with α, and metrological performance for estimating α is high, saturating the Cramér-Rao bound using position measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the nonlinear properties of the double-Morse potential as a quantum state resource, leveraging its double-well structure and anharmonicity for potential quantum applications.

Method: The paper employs analytical derivations of ground state wave functions and energy spectra, treating the asymmetry parameter α as the main control variable. Non-Gaussianity and non-classicality are quantified, and metrological performance is assessed by calculating Fisher information and constructing estimators.

Result: Increasing α leads to an increase in both non-Gaussianity and non-classicality metrics. The metrological performance is excellent, with position measurements on the wells achieving high precision and saturating the Cramér-Rao bound, indicating strong potential for practical quantum applications.

Conclusion: The double-Morse potential successfully serves as a controllable source of non-Gaussian quantum states, with its non-classical properties and metrological capabilities enhancing systematically with α, offering promising applications in quantum information processing and computation.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear properties of the double-Morse potential as a possible resource for single-mode quantum states because of its double-well structure and anharmonicity. We derive the ground state wave function and the associated energy spectrum analytically, using the asymmetry (width parameter) $α$ as the primary control parameter. These results show a systematic and evident influence on $α$. We assess the non-Gaussianity and non-classicality measures, quantifying their nonlinearity and quantum behavior. In particular, we discover that both metrics rise monotonically with $α$. Furthermore, we examine the metrological performance for estimating $α$. By calculating the pertinent Fisher information and building workable estimators, we show that optimal strategies can saturate the Cramér-Rao bound, with straightforward position measurements on shallow wells already producing high precision. These results collectively demonstrate that the double-Morse potential is a genuine, controllable source of non-Gaussianity, whose non-classicality and metrological applications increase with $α$. We highlight the potential applications of this model in real-world quantum technologies and discuss the implications for continuous-variable quantum information processing and computation.

Abstract: We construct an important missing piece in the entanglement theory of pure three-qubit states, which is a polynomial measure of W entanglement, working in parallel to the three-tangle, which is a polynomial measure of GHZ entanglement, and to the bipartite concurrence, which is a polynomial measure of bipartite entanglement. We also show that these entanglement measures are ordered, the bipartite measure is larger than the W measure, which is larger than the GHZ measure. It is meaningful then to consider these three types of three-qubit entanglement, which are also ordered, bipartite is weaker than W, which is weaker than GHZ, in parallel to the order of the three equivalence classes of entangled three-qubit states.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new hybrid framework for classical-to-quantum data mapping using trigonometric functions in arithmetic-based quantum algorithms has been developed. It addresses the limitation of current variational quantum gate learning mechanisms by introducing a classical data-traceable quantum oracle with a linearly scalable circuit depth. The approach enhances the interpretability of QAOA outputs through mid-quantum measurement data preprocessing and achieves polynomial-time verification of solution quality on IBM's Pittsburgh hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical-to-quantum data mapping is a crucial task in quantum computing, but existing approaches have limitations in terms of algorithmic guarantees and interpretability. This paper aims to overcome these limitations through improved quantum oracle design and measurement data preprocessing techniques.

Method: The authors developed a classical data-traceable quantum oracle with a circuit depth proportional to the number of qubits. They implemented a shallow quantum circuit layout (SQC) and utilized mid-quantum measurement data preprocessing to enhance the interpretability of QAOA outputs without requiring full quantum state tomography. Experiments were conducted on IBM's Pittsburgh quantum hardware.

Result: The proposed framework achieved polynomial-time verification of solution quality, demonstrating its potential for industrial applications. The results suggest a pathway toward reliable quantum-classical algorithms that can bridge near-term quantum capabilities with practical optimization needs.

Conclusion: This paper presents a significant advancement in classical-to-quantum data mapping by introducing a scalable quantum oracle and innovative measurement data preprocessing. The successful implementation on IBM's hardware validates the framework's effectiveness for real-world optimization problems.

Abstract: The encoding of classical to quantum data mapping through trigonometric functions within arithmetic-based quantum computation algorithms leads to the exploitation of multivariate distributions. The studied variational quantum gate learning mechanism, which relies on agnostic gradient optimization, does not offer algorithmic guarantees for the correlation of results beyond the measured bitstring outputs. Consequently, existing methodologies are inapplicable to this problem. In this study, we present a classical data-traceable quantum oracle characterized by a circuit depth that increases linearly with the number of qubits. This configuration facilitates the learning of approximate result patterns through a shallow quantum circuit (SQC) layout. Moreover, our approach demonstrates that the classical preprocessing of mid-quantum measurement data enhances the interpretability of quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) outputs without requiring full quantum state tomography. By establishing an inferable mapping between the classical input and quantum circuit outcomes, we obtained experimental results on the state-of-the-art IBM Pittsburgh hardware, which yielded polynomial-time verification of the solution quality. This hybrid framework bridges the gap between near-term quantum capabilities and practical optimization requirements, offering a pathway toward reliable quantum-classical algorithms for industrial applications.

Abstract: Quantum steering is a fundamental quantum correlation that plays a pivotal role in quantum technologies, but its verification crucially relies on precise measurements -- an assumption often undermined by practical imperfections. Here, we investigate multipartite steering verification under imprecise measurements and develop a quantitative method that effectively eliminates false positives induced by measurement imprecision. A comparison with a device-independent approach demonstrates that our method accurately delineates the scope of valid verification. In a special case, our method also enables the verification of multipartite entanglement under nonideal conditions. These results substantially enhance the robustness of multipartite steering and entanglement verification against measurement imprecision, thereby promoting their applicability in realistic quantum technologies.

Abstract: We characterise optical transitions of neodymium ions (Nd3+) in antiferromagnetic neodymium gallate (NdGaO3) with applied fields up to 3 T. The magnetic phase of this material has not previously been studied with the field along its magnetisation axis. The measured optical spectra indicate three magnetic phases -- antiferromagnetic, intermediate, and paramagnetic -- where the intermediate phase likely forms a different magnetic structure from typical spin-flop phases. The observed absorptions were classified into two distinct families of optical transitions: single-Nd and two-Nd absorptions. We demonstrate that the optical transitions in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases can be modelled using a standard single-ion crystal-field Hamiltonian that interacts with a mean magnetisation from the rest of the lattice, and we expand that model to encompass pairs of ions, explaining the origins of the two-Nd transitions. This study offers a deeper understanding of the optical transitions in rare-earth antiferromagnetic crystals, which have been recently attracting significant interest for microwave-to-optical quantum transduction, despite being relatively unexplored to date.

Conclusion: This paper represents a significant advancement in quantum communication, offering a promising solution for large-scale deployment of QSDC while contributing to the field of quantum information science.

Abstract: Quantum Secure Direct Communication (QSDC), a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in quantum communication, exploits quantum states for unmediated information transmission. Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science.

Abstract: We use superconducting qubit quantum annealing devices to determine the ground state of Ising models with algebraically decaying competing long-range interactions in the thermodynamic limit. This is enabled by a unit-cell-based optimization scheme, in which the finite optimizations on each unit cell are performed using commercial quantum annealing hardware. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, we choose three exemplary problems relevant for other quantum simulation platforms and material science: (i) the calculation of devil's staircases of magnetization plateaux of the long-range Ising model in a longitudinal field on the triangular lattice, motivated by atomic and molecular quantum simulators; (ii) the evaluation of the ground state of the same model on the Kagome lattice in the absence of a field, motivated by artificial spin ice metamaterials; (iii) the study of models with additional few-nearest-neighbor interactions relevant for frustrated Ising compounds with potential long-range interactions. The approach discussed in this work provides a useful and realistic application of existing quantum annealing technology, applicable across many research areas in which lattice problems with resummable long-range interactions are relevant.

TL;DR: The paper examines the spreading of stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy in many-body quantum systems under brickwork random Clifford circuits, revealing that the entropy spreads diffusively within a ballistic light cone despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. The analysis is extended to a restricted Clifford circuit, showing a superdiffusive spreading behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spreading of quantum resources like magic states is crucial for advancing quantum computation and demonstrating quantum advantage. The use of stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy provides a computable and experimentally accessible measure for this purpose.

Method: The authors investigate the spreading of stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy by considering an initial product state with magic in a local region evolving under brickwork random Clifford circuits. They specifically analyze the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates and then extend their analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit.

Result: For Haar-random local Clifford gates, the spreading profile of normalized single-qubit SRE exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone. When analyzing a restricted Clifford circuit, a superdiffusive spreading behavior is observed.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the understanding of how magic states spread in quantum systems under different circuit configurations, providing insights into the behavior of quantum resources essential for quantum computation and advantage.

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.

Abstract: We study the polaritonic states and dynamics of multiple Jahn-Teller (JT) active molecules coupled to the modes of a Fabry-Perot cavity. We find that collective effects dramatically alter the interplay of electronic, vibrational and cavity angular momenta, giving rise to markedly different polaritonic spectra and dynamics even when going from one to two JT molecules. Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system. Our results uncover new pathways for vibronic angular momentum transfer unique to collective molecular polaritonics with potential implications for cavity-assisted photo-physics and photo-chemistry.

Motivation: The study builds on a recent work by Gao to investigate the role of induced electric fields in confirming the time-dependent AB-effect, addressing key complexities in the field.

Method: The authors employ rigorous theoretical analysis, carefully examining the impact of time-varying vector potentials and induced electric fields.

Result: Their analysis identifies a significant nontrivial effect of the induced electric field, providing a foundation for verifying the existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.

Conclusion: The paper contributes a critical perspective on the time-dependent AB-effect by thoroughly analyzing the interaction of time-varying vector potentials and induced electric fields,advancing the understanding of this fundamental quantum phenomenon.

Abstract: Whether the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect even exists or not has been the subject of long-standing debate. There are two factors complicating the problem. First, in the closed spacetime line integral of the vector potential that is thought to give the AB-phase shift, how to treat the time-varying vector potential is highly nontrivial. Second, the time-varying magnetic flux generates induced electric field even outside the solenoid. In the present paper, motivated by a recent work by Gao, we re-investigate the role of the induced electric field with the utmost care. This analysis reveals a highly nontrivial effect of the induced electric field, which turns out to be useful for verifying the very existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.

Abstract: Elucidating the emergence of irreversible macroscopic laws from reversible quantum many-body dynamics is a question of broad importance across all quantum science. Many-body decoherence plays a key role in this transition, yet connecting microscopic dynamics to emergent macroscopic behavior remains challenging. Here, in a doubly disordered electron-nuclear spin network, we uncover an emergent decoherence law for nuclear polarization, $e^{-\sqrt{R_{p}t}}e^{-R_{d}t}$, that is robust across broad parameter regimes. We trace its microscopic origins to two interdependent decoherence channels: long-range interactions mediated by the electron network and spin transport within the nuclear network exhibiting anomalous, sub-diffusive dynamics. We demonstrate the capacity to control--and even eliminate--either channel individually through a combination of Floquet engineering and (optical) environment modulation. We find that disorder, typically viewed as detrimental, here proves protective, generating isolated electron-free clusters that localize polarization and prolong coherence lifetimes. These findings establish a microscopic framework for manipulating decoherence pathways and suggests engineered disorder as a new design principle for realizing long-lived quantum memories and sensors.

Abstract: Scattering of non-classical light is enabling new ways to study and control photon transport. However, advances in this field often rely on simplifying assumptions regarding the quantum light's generation and its source. In this work, we relax some of these assumptions and probe the behavior of entangled photon pairs passing through a disordered layer after being generated by a randomly scattered pump via spontaneous parametric down conversion. We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a cavity-coupled finite quantum system which can act as a quantum battery by harnessing noise induced coherences. We apply the methodology of full counting statistics to capture higher-order fluctuations of quanta exchange in the storage station. Together with the thermodynamic parameters, the fluctuations constitute a training platform for unsupervised as well as supervised learning models in predicting ergotropy. We identify a minimal predictive feature set from the battery's operating parameters that can classify the ergotropy into different regimes with great accuracy.Our results show that the usual quantum and thermodynamic variables are inadequate for the purpose of identifying high ergotropy regimes in isolation. Rather, it is the kurtosis of quanta exchange in the storage and the noise-induced coherence in the leakage mode that become the dominant quantities in controlling the magnitude of ergotropy.

Method: The study employs complexity-theoretic analysis, focusing on the impact of photon loss. It identifies a loss threshold above which the complexity of GBS remains unchanged and quantifies the statistical distance between ideal and lossy GBS to establish intractability criteria.

Result: The research reveals that GBS maintains its classical intractability even when a limited amount of photon loss occurs, specifically when at most a logarithmic fraction of photons is lost.

Conclusion: This study advances the understanding of GBS's resilience to noise, paving the way for more robust demonstrations of quantum advantage using near-term quantum implementations.

Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a prominent candidate for the experimental demonstration of quantum advantage. However, while the current implementations of GBS are unavoidably subject to noise, the robustness of the classical intractability of GBS against noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we establish the complexity-theoretic foundations for the classical intractability of noisy GBS under photon loss, which is a dominant source of imperfection in current implementations. We identify the loss threshold below which lossy GBS maintains the same complexity-theoretic level as ideal GBS, and show that this holds when at most a logarithmic fraction of photons is lost. We additionally derive an intractability criterion for the loss rate through a direct quantification of the statistical distance between ideal and lossy GBS. This work presents the first rigorous characterization of classically intractable regimes of lossy GBS, thereby serving as a crucial step toward demonstrating quantum advantage with near-term implementations.

Abstract: Cavity magnonics, owing to its strong magnon-photon coupling and excellent tunability, has attracted significant interest in quantum information science. However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics. Our results establish a versatile and controllable approach to generating and enhancing quantum entanglement through double-squeezed-field interference, opening new avenues to study and enhance macroscopic quantum physics in cavity-magnon systems with only beam-splitter interactions.

Abstract: We present a self-contained analytical model for biphoton generation in microring resonators. Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters.

Abstract: Magic (non-stabilizerness) is a key resource for achieving universal fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond classical computation. While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-Rényi entropy.

Abstract: Parametric amplification is a key ingredient of a wide range of phenomena, from the classical to the quantum domain. Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime.

Abstract: We report the realization of an all-optical, tabletop effective-negative-mass oscillator (ENMO) scheme capable of canceling quantum noise when cascaded with an opto-mechanical sensor susceptible to (quantum) radiation pressure noise. Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies. With our current realization, we project a broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB, corresponding to a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise at the optimal frequency of maximum reduction, indicating the readiness of the ENMO for application. We discuss the prospects for new applications in quantum information and communication using the same platform.

Abstract: Interactions between objects can be classified as fundamental or emergent. Fundamental interactions are either extremely short-range or decay inversely with the separation distance, such as the Coulomb potential between charges or the gravitational attraction between masses. In contrast, emergent quantum van der Waals (vdW) and Casimir interactions decay considerably faster ($R^{-6}$ or $R^{-7}$) with distance $R$. Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom. Although weaker than vdW forces, this MB-QED $R^{-1}$ interaction may substantially surpass gravitational attraction in future experiments probing quantum gravity at microscopic scales.

Conclusion: 局域规范对称性 decoherence 的影响需要更深入研究以确保子系统码的稳定性和容错性

Abstract: Some of lattice-gauge-theory models, in particular gauge-Higgs model (GHM), can be regarded and work as a subsystem code. This work studies the effect of local-gauge-symmetric decoherence on the GHM from the perspective of the subsystem code. We clarify the global phase diagram of the subsystem code. In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information. For dynamical unitary perturbations described by interactions between the logical qubit and gauge qubits, the deformation of the subsystem code drastically depends on the initial mixed state of the gauge qubits.

Conclusion: 通过强化学习优化门结构,可降低entangle门的数量,同时保持高态的 prepare 精度;这种方法对于提高量子计算效率具有重要意义。

Abstract: Current experimental quantum computing devices are limited by noise, mainly originating from entangling gates. If an efficient gate sequence for an operation is unknown, one often employs layered parameterized quantum circuits, especially hardware-efficient ansätze, with fixed entangling layer structures. We demonstrate a reinforcement learning algorithm to improve on these by optimizing the entangling gate sequence in the task of quantum state preparation. This allows us to restrict the required number of CNOT gates while taking the qubit connectivity architecture into account. Recent advancements using reinforcement learning have already demonstrated the power of this technique when optimizing the circuit for a sequence of non-parameterized gates. We extend this approach to parameterized gate sets by incorporating general single-qubit unitaries, thus allowing us to consistently reach higher state preparation fidelities at the same number of CNOT gates compared to a hardware-efficient ansatz.

Abstract: We investigate whether shallow quantum circuits can accurately reproduce the short-horizon dynamics of discrete-time Markov chains derived from fashion electronic-commerce recommendation links. Transition operators are compiled into block-encoded circuits and iterated using fixed-point oblivious amplitude amplification, and amplitude-encoded marginals are used to estimate the classical push-forward. Empirically, colour categories such as black and, to a lesser extent, white function as high-degree hubs that dominate probability flow. Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap. The results identify hub-pruned block-encodings as a practical heuristic for near-term experiments on recommendation dynamics using small quantum registers, and they provide a reproducible benchmarking protocol that reports total-variation distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and state fidelity as functions of circuit depth and prediction horizon.

TL;DR:  paper presents an extension of Exact Factorization formalism to include responses to electromagnetic fields, proving a conjecture that Berry curvature compensates Lorentz force effects, enhancing nuclear motion modeling in such conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  study of nuclear-electronic interactions under external electromagnetic fields is crucial for accurate modeling in quantum dynamics, especially for systems requiring non-adiabatic approaches. Berry curvature's role in such systems has been a conjecture, and this proof provides a theoretical foundation for enhanced modeling accuracy.

Method:  the authors developed an extended EF formalism incorporating vector potentials and solved the non-adiabatic equations to derive the necessary constraints, proving the Berry curvature's compensation effect.

Result:  the main result is a rigorous proof that in non-adiabatic EF theory, Berry curvature compensation occurs similarly to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, ensuring consistency under external electromagnetic fields.

Conclusion:  this extension of EF theory validates a key conjecture and provides a more robust framework for modeling nuclear motion in external fields, enhancing applications in quantum chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: The Exact Factorization (EF) theory aims at the separation of the nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in the many-body (MB) quantum mechanical problem. Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property.

Motivation: Understanding the maximality of entanglement is crucial in quantum information studies.

Method: Explored rank-2, rank-3, and rank-4 states using matrix rank analysis and majorization theory.

Result: No fixed spectrum beyond pure states allows for maximally entangled states in two-qubit systems.

Conclusion: As such states are impossible, there’s no general maximally entangled state for shared spectrum beyond pure states.

Abstract: The existence of a maximally entangled pure state is a cornerstone result of entanglement theory that has paramount consequences in quantum information theory. A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist. In this work we extend this impossibility result to all rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states as well as for a large class of eigenvalue distributions in the case where the rank equals four.

Abstract: The optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolver is severely challenged by finite-shot sampling noise, which distorts the cost landscape, creates false variational minima, and induces statistical bias called winner's curse. We investigate this phenomenon by benchmarking eight classical optimizers spanning gradient-based, gradient-free, and metaheuristic methods on quantum chemistry Hamiltonians H$_2$, H$_4$ chain, LiH (in both full and active spaces) using the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz. We analyze difficulties of gradient-based methods (e.g., SLSQP, BFGS) in noisy regimes, where they diverge or stagnate. We show that the bias of estimator can be corrected by tracking the \textit{population mean}, rather than the biased best individual when using population based optimizer. Our findings, which are shown to generalize to hardware-efficient circuits and condensed matter models, identify adaptive metaheuristics (specifically CMA-ES and iL-SHADE) as the most effective and resilient strategies. We conclude by presenting a set of practical guidelines for reliable VQE optimization under noise, centering on the co-design of physically motivated ansatz and the use of adaptive optimizers.

Abstract: We investigate the use of discrete-time quantum walks to sample from an almost-uniform distribution, in the absence of any external source of randomness. Integers are encoded on the vertices of a cycle graph, and a quantum walker evolves for a fixed number of steps before its position is measured and recorded. The walker is then reset to the measured site, and the procedure is iterated to produce the sequence of random numbers. We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time. By analyzing the iterated convolution of the quantum walk transition probability and exploiting the ergodic theorem, we demonstrate convergence of the marginal distributions toward the uniform distribution in the asymptotic limit.

Abstract: Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) algorithms constitute one of the most effective paradigms for exploiting the computational advantages of quantum systems in large-scale numerical tasks. By operating in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, quantum circuits enable exponential speed-ups and provide access to richer representations of cost landscapes compared to purely classical methods. These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.
  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems. Our approach leverages Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) as quantum gating modules that both enhance feature extraction and improve suppression of irrelevant information. This integration directly addresses the computational bottlenecks of deep learning architectures by exploiting quantum resources for more efficient representation learning.
  We analyze how introducing quantum subroutines into large language models (LLMs) impacts their generalization capability, expressivity, and parameter efficiency. The results highlight the potential of quantum-enhanced gating mechanisms as a path toward scalable, resource-efficient NLP models, in a limited simulation step. Within the first four epochs on a reshaped MNIST dataset with input format (batch, 784, d_model), our hybrid model achieved 24.6% accuracy while using one quantum layer and achieve higher expressivity, compared to 21.6% obtained by a purely classical selection mechanism. we state No founding

Abstract: Qubit-efficient optimization seeks to represent an $N$-variable combinatorial problem within a Hilbert space smaller than $2^N$, using only as much quantum structure as the objective itself requires. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\lceil\log_2 N\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) are one of the best available tools to study many-body quantum systems. TNs are particularly suitable for one-dimensional local Hamiltonians, while their performance for generic geometries is mainly limited by two aspects: the limitation in expressive power and the approximate extraction of information. Here we investigate the performance of superposition-of-product-states (SPS) ansatz, a variational framework structurally related to canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability. We then use this ansatz for ground state search in tilted Ising models--including one-dimensional and three-dimensional with short- and long-range interaction, and a random network--demonstrating that SPS can attain high accuracy.

Abstract: The Fourier transform (FT) represents a key tool in modern spectroscopy which drastically reduces measurement times and helps to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in spectra. Fourier transforming exponentially decaying time domain signals gives Lorentzian line shapes which can be manipulated by apodization methods. The underlying transitions of spectral lines can be visualized by a Bloch vector or equivalent phase-space representations. Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes. In particular, we find that truncated parabolic lines with finite support can be obtained by the half transform and introduce a new apodization approach to replicate this line shape in experimental spectra. We discuss concrete applications in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states, which cannot be written as mixtures of Gaussian states, are necessary to achieve a quantum advantage in continuous variable systems. They represent an important benchmark for the realization of an advanced quantum light source, as they cannot be made by simple means such as displacement and squeezing. We introduce an attenuation-resistant sufficient criterion for quantum non-Gaussian states based on the second- and third-order correlation functions, $g^{(2)}$ and $g^{(3)}$. The general non-linear bound for classical mixtures of Gaussian states is $\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \sqrt{g^{(2)}} \geq 2$. Any mixture of Gaussian states must fulfill this inequality, thus, the violation of it represents a direct confirmation of quantum non-Gaussianity. We experimentally show the non-Gaussianity of the state produced by a quantum dot single-photon source, where we obtain $\sqrt{g^{(3)}} + 3 \sqrt{g^{(2)}} = 0.174 (13)$, which represents a statistical significance of more than $100$ standard deviations.

Conclusion: 引入机器学习的新范式，实现持续自适应计算，提升量子计算机可靠性。

Abstract: The promise of fault-tolerant quantum computing is challenged by environmental drift that relentlessly degrades the quality of quantum operations. The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing.

Abstract: Dynamical chaos in a periodically driven, dissipative soft impact oscillator is investigated in the quantum regime using the complex-number quantum Langevin equation (c-number QLE). The averaged system dynamics are analyzed through a comprehensive suite of time-series diagnostics, including bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, Fourier spectra, and the 0-1 test. Systematic variation of the wall position reveals a rich sequence of dynamical transitions and grazing bifurcations, progressing from periodic to multiperiodic motion and culminating in chaotic behavior. These results demonstrate the persistence of impact-induced chaos under quantum dissipation and elucidate how environmental fluctuations influence non-linear dynamics in open quantum systems.

### [53] [The FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model for early fault-tolerant quantum algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08508)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper proposes a new cost model for estimating quantum computing resources, highlighting its application in reducing resource requirements for fault-tolerant algorithms. The FLASQ model provides a more holistic approach compared to simpler metrics like circuit depth or T-count, incorporating factors like routing and ancilla space. Results show significant improvements in resource estimation. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum computing relies heavily on resource estimates for algorithm and hardware co-design, especially for near-term fault-tolerant quantum devices. Accurate resource estimation is essential for guiding algorithm development and hardware design. Previous methods using simple metrics like circuit depth or T-count often fail to capture critical overheads, leading to inaccurate estimates and suboptimal resource utilization. There is a need for a more comprehensive and accurate cost model that considers factors like routing, ancilla management, and timing constraints. 

Method:  The paper introduces the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, specifically designed for architectures using a two-dimensional qubit layout implementing the surface code. The model abstracts routing complexities by treating ancilla space and time as fluid, enabling tractable estimation of spacetime volumes while capturing key details overlooked by simpler models. The model also enforces constraints related to circuit measurement depth and processor reaction time. The authors apply the FLASQ model to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice simulation and compare it with previous estimates. They also evaluate the Hamming weight phasing approach for synthesizing parallel rotations, considering the overheads introduced by 2D layout and additional ancilla qubits. The paper combines theoretical analysis with numerical simulations to validate the model. 

Result:  Applying the FLASQ model leads to significant improvements in resource estimation. The analysis shows that modern advances such as magic state cultivation and the integration of quantum error correction and mitigation reduce both the time and space required for a standard two-dimensional lattice simulation by an order of magnitude compared to previous estimates. Additionally, the evaluation of the Hamming weight phasing approach reveals that despite its low T-count, the overheads introduced by imposing a 2D layout and using additional ancilla qubits make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerant applications. The improved resource estimation provided by the FLASQ model aligns early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs, making it easier for quantum algorithmists to work with hardware without requiring extensive knowledge of quantum error correction. 

Conclusion:  The FLASQ cost model offers a more comprehensive and accurate approach to estimating resources for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and their implementations. By considering factors such as routing, ancillary space management, and timing constraints, the model provides insights that simpler metrics overlook, leading to more efficient resource allocation and better alignment between algorithm design and hardware capabilities in early fault-tolerant quantum computing. This advancement is crucial for advancing quantum computing by facilitating effective co-design of algorithms and hardware in the realm of fault-tolerance.

Abstract: Holistic resource estimates are essential for guiding the development of fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and the computers they will run on. This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists.

Abstract: We study a counterintuitive property of 'conditioning' on the result of measuring a subsystem of a quantum state: such conditioning can boost design quality, at the cost of increased system size. We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs.

Abstract: The Koopman and the Perron-Frobenius operators are increasingly becoming popular in the control of complex nonlinear systems such as in a wide variety of robotics problems and flow control. This is in addition to the wide interest in the application of operator methods for better understanding of fluid flows. A particular problem of relevance to all such applications is, how does the Koopman or the Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator change if the underlying vector field of the dynamical system undergoes small changes or if two vector fields are added. The current numerical methods rely on significant computations and model or parameter changes to the dynamical system often require all the computations to be repeated. This paper reports on a novel approach to the computation of the approximate PF and Koopman operators in such cases. The approach makes use of the exponentials of the infinitesimal generators of these operators. It is shown that this approximation depends on the Lie bracket of the vector field and the perturbation vector field. Examples are described where the Koopman and PF operators are constructed from operators of primitive flows and for cases where the model parameters undergo perturbations.

Abstract: We assess the ergodic properties of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou-$α$ model for generic initial conditions using a Toda integral. It serves as an adiabatic invariant for the system and a suitable observable to measure its equilibrium time. Over this timescale, the onset of action diffusion results in ergodic temporal fluctuations. We compare this timescale with the inverse of the maximum Lyapunov exponent $λ$ and its saturation time, which are systematically shorter. The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density. We measure the dependence of energy density on the critical system size and relate this observation to the possible emergence of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser regime. We numerically determine the critical energy density of this regime, finding that it approximately decays as $1/N^2$ with the number of particles N.

Abstract: Abandoned oil and gas wells pose significant environmental risks due to the potential leakage of hydrocarbons, brine and chemical pollutants. Detecting such leaks remains extremely challenging due to the weak acoustic emission and high ambient noise in the deep sea. This paper reviews the application of passive sonar systems combined with artificial intelligence (AI) in underwater oil and gas leak detection. The advantages and limitations of traditional monitoring methods, including fibre optic, capacitive and pH sensors, are compared with those of passive sonar systems. Advanced AI methods that enhance signal discrimination, noise suppression and data interpretation capabilities are explored for leak detection. Emerging solutions such as embedded AI analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs), deep learning-based denoising networks and semantically aware underwater optical communication (UOC) frameworks are also discussed to overcome issues such as low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and transmission instability. Furthermore, a hybrid approach combining non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), convolutional neural networks (CNN) and temporal models (GRU, TCN) is proposed to improve the classification and quantification accuracy of leak events. Despite challenges such as data scarcity and environmental change, AI-assisted passive sonar has shown great potential in real-time, energy-efficient and non-invasive underwater monitoring, contributing to sustainable environmental protection and maritime safety management.

TL;DR: Neutron orbital angular momentum (OAM) states and Airy beams enable advanced structured neutron science for materials characterization and fundamental physics. The demonstration of multimode neutron beams enhances spatial and angular-momentum information retrieval, surpassing current efficiency limits, and supports efficient investigation of material scattering properties and nuclear interactions through structured sources composed of discrete OAM spectra. This work opens new avenues in neutron scattering technology for both experimental and theoretical studies in neutron science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work stems from the need to advance neutron scattering technology to better characterize materials and study fundamental physics. By introducing structured neutron beams, the research aims to retrieve more detailed spatial and angular momentum information, potentially overcoming existing limitations and enabling more comprehensive analysis of neutron interactions with matter.

Method: The research employs the experimental realization and characterization of neutron OAM states and Airy beams. The method involves demonstrating multimode structured neutron beams that can simultaneously access multiple OAM modes and hybrid combinations of OAM and Airy states. This approach is inspired by wavelength- or OAM-multiplexing techniques in optics, aiming to enhance the efficiency of material scattering property investigation and nuclear interaction studies.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates the experimental realization of neutron OAM states and Airy beams. The multimode structured neutron beams were shown to provide simultaneous access to multiple OAM modes and hybrid combinations, achieving higher phase-grating efficiency and enabling efficient investigation of material scattering properties and nuclear interactions. The results suggest significant advancements in neutron scattering technology for both experimental and theoretical research in neutron science.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant step forward in leveraging neutron OAM states and Airy beams to enhance neutron scattering applications. The successful demonstration of multimode structured neutron beams opens new possibilities for advancing our understanding of neutron interactions in materials and fundamental physics.

Abstract: The experimental realization of neutron orbital angular momentum (OAM) states and neutron Airy beams has opened new avenues for structured neutron science in both materials characterization and fundamental physics. These additional degrees of freedom in scattering experiments enable the exploration of selection rules for neutrons, the analysis of scattering properties in topological materials, and the generation of auto-focusing neutron beams. In the effort to enhance the amount of spatial and angular-momentum information retrievable from a single measurement, and to overcome current phase-grating efficiency limits, here we demonstrate multimode structured neutron beams that enable simultaneous access to multiple, well-defined OAM modes, and to hybrid combinations of OAM and Airy states. This multimode approach, analogous to wavelength- or OAM-multiplexing in optics, facilitates the efficient investigation of material scattering properties and nuclear interactions with a neutron source composed of a discretized OAM spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by the need for sources of highly correlated photons for advanced optical technologies, quantum information processing, and sensing, driven by the potential to enable extreme operating temperatures and reduced energy requirements.

Method: The authors employ theoretical modeling and experimental validation to demonstrate superradiant photon emission in a coupled organic-/photonic-met wonders setup, using J-aggregates with molecular dipoles aligned on a chip.

Result: The system exhibits a 250-fold superradiant enhancement of correlated photon emission through strong coupling with a photonic bound-state in the continuum, achieving g2(0) above 13 at high excitation densities, which surpasses the typical bosonic threshold for quantum phonons.

Conclusion: This is a significant breakthrough in on-chip photonics, offering new avenues for ultrafast photon sources and light-matter manipulation with practical implementation at room temperature and low excitation levels.

Abstract: Sources of highly correlated photons are critical for non-linear optics, emerging quantum information, communication and sensing technologies, as well as for fundamental studies of light-matter interaction. A strategy to realize such sources relies on the cooperative coupling of quantum emitters, enabling collective light emission known as superradiance. Here, we demonstrate that organic molecular J-aggregates exhibit room temperature superradiant emission that transitions to a highly collective regime of ~250 synchronized J-excitons when strongly coupled to delocalized photonic modes of a silicon bound-state-in-the-continuum metasurface. This enhanced cooperativity manifests as a Rabi splitting dependent scaling of both emission rate and intensity, driving the system into a superbunching regime of photon statistics. At the highest excitation density, we observe massively superbunched photon emission with g2(0)>13, unlocking new possibilities for engineering ultrafast, temporally correlated light sources that can operate at room temperature.

Abstract: We report experimental evidence of mechanical wave generation by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) under radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs, 65mT, 800 kHz, at 100ms bursts) in the ultrasonic (US) frequency range. We developed an experimental setup to detect the second harmonic (SH) signal under isothermal conditions. This SH-US signal was observed only in samples containing MNPs and consequently originated from the EMF interaction on samples containing MNPs. These findings suggest that US generation due to magneto-acoustic interaction in the MNPs could be responsible for the cell damage induced by EMF in cells containing MNPs without increasing the temperature. Experiments performed on magnetically aligned MNP clusters in gelatin significantly enhance the amplitude of the SH signal compared to non-aligned samples. This phenomenon could pave the way for new theoretical and practical approaches as for 'in vivo' magnetoacoustics theragnostic.

Conclusion: 该研究为磁电介导体在神经计算中的应用提供了重要的实验依据，并提出了优化设计原则，以根据输入信号特点调整装置性能。

Abstract: In-materio computing exploits the intrinsic physical dynamics of materials to perform complex computations, enabling low-power, real-time data processing by embedding computation directly within physical layers. Here, we demonstrate a voltage-controlled magneto-ionic device that functions as a reservoir computer capable of forecasting chaotic time series. The device consists of a crossbar structure with a Ta/CoFeB/Ta/MgO/Ta bottom electrode and a LiPON/Pt top electrode. A chaotic Mackey-Glass time series is encoded into a voltage signal applied to the device, while 2D Fourier transforms of voltage-dependent magnetic domain patterns form the output. Performance is influenced by the input rate, smoothing of the output, the number of elements in the reservoir state vector, and the training duration. We identify two distinct computational regimes: short-term prediction is optimized using smoothed, low-dimensional states with minimal training, whereas prediction around the Mackey-Glass delay time benefits from unsmoothed, high-dimensional states and extended training. Reservoir computing metrics reveal that slower input rates are more tolerant to output smoothing, while faster input rates degrade both memory capacity and nonlinear processing. These findings demonstrate the potential of magneto-ionic systems for neuromorphic computing and offer design principles for tuning performance in response to input signal characteristics.

### [62] [A New Derivation of Classical Gravitational Second Law of Thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07510)
*V. R. Shajiee,M. M. Sheikh-Jabbari*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The article presents a new definition of gravitational entropy within the covariant phase space framework, associating it with local boosts rather than horizons or trapped surfaces. It generalizes previous notions of entropy and proves the second law of thermodynamics for gravitational systems by showing that entropy variations are non-negative under the strong energy condition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the thermodynamic nature of black holes and the broader desire to extend thermodynamic principles to gravitating systems, which has been a significant open question in theoretical physics.

Method: The authors employ the covariant phase space formalism to define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with local boosts. They then compute entropy variations along the path of any causal observer and apply the strong energy condition to establish the non-negativity of these variations.

Result: The key result is the successful demonstration that gravitational entropy, defined in this manner, always increases or remains constant as observers move causally through spacetime, provided the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel and general framework for understanding gravitational entropy and its behavior, offering a significant step forward in the thermodynamic understanding of spacetime.

Abstract: It is established that black holes have entropy and behave as thermodynamical systems. Associating entropy to gravitational fields has not remained limited to black holes, necessitating the notion of the second law of thermodynamics in gravitating systems. There have been many ideas and attempts to prove the second law in gravitational systems starting from first principles. Within the covariant phase space formalism, we define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with the local boosts, detaching the gravitational entropy from horizons or trapped surfaces. Our definition encompasses and generalizes the existing notions of entropy. Using this definition for the Einstein gravity case, we compute variations of the entropy along the path of any causal observer and establish that the entropy variations are always non-negative if the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition integrated along any segment of the causal path.

### [63] [Macdonald Index From Refined Kontsevich-Soibelman Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07521)
*George Andrews,Anindya Banerjee,Ranveer Kumar Singh,Runkai Tao*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: We propose a refined operator for a specific class of 4d N=2 SCFTs, showing its trace relates to the Macdonald index. We conjecture closed-form expressions for the Macdonald indices of certain Argyres-Douglas theories for any simply-laced Lie algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores refined operators in specific 4d N=2 superconformal field theories, aiming to connect these operators to significant invariants in theoretical physics, such as the Macdonald index.

Method: The authors define a refined version of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operator for a class of theories characterized by particular features of their Coulomb branches and BPS quivers. They analyze the operator's trace and conjecture its relation to the Macdonald index.

Result: The paper provides evidence that the trace of the refined operator is related to the Macdonald index of the theory and conjectures closed-form expressions for the Macdonald indices of the (A1,g) Argyres-Douglas theories for any simply-laced Lie algebra g.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of refined operators and their connections to significant invariants in 4d N=2 superconformal field theories.

Abstract: We propose a refinement of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operator for a class of ``special'' 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories characterized by the following conditions: (1) their Coulomb branch admits a source/sink chamber, i.e., a chamber in which the BPS quiver consists of only source and sink nodes, (2) The nodes with valency greater than 2 of the BPS quiver in a source/sink chamber are either all sources or all sinks. We present strong evidence that the trace of this refined operator is related to the Macdonald index of the theory. In particular, we conjecture closed form expressions for the Macdonald indices of the $(A_1,\mathfrak{g})$ Argyres-Douglas theories for any simply-laced Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$.

Abstract: We construct a large portion of the massive spectrum of the open bosonic string using light-cone quantization, providing explicit oscillator realizations for individual single-particle states as well as for full Regge trajectories. We show how combinations of transverse oscillators organize into irreducible SO(25) representations, and provide an algorithm for constructing them level by level. We then develop a general method to "climb" the spectrum-adding oscillators in a controlled way that generates entire Regge trajectories from a finite set of seed states. Remarkably, the coefficients determining each state's oscillator composition depend on the level in a simple way, allowing closed-form expressions for infinitely many states. Beyond individual trajectories, we explore internal regularities of the spectrum and establish relations among families of trajectories, extending the concept of a Regge trajectory to more general constructions. Our results expose a highly ordered and recursive structure underlying the open-string spectrum, suggesting that its massive excitations form an algorithmically constructible network. The framework presented here lays the groundwork for computing three-point amplitudes of arbitrary massive states, the essential building blocks of string interactions, which we tackle in upcoming work.

Abstract: Pursuing our analysis of [1], we study the gravitational solution space around a null hypersurface in the bulk of spacetime, such as a black hole or a cosmological horizon. We discuss the corresponding characteristic initial value problem both in the metric and Newman-Penrose formalisms, and establish an explicit dictionary between the two. This allows us to identify Weyl-covariant structures in the solution space, including hierarchies of recursion relations encoding the flux-balance laws. We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance. This connection is naturally formulated within the Newman-Penrose formalism by performing a partially off-shell conformal compactification and identifying the analogue of the Ashtekar-Streubel symplectic structure in the radial expansion near the null hypersurface. Using this framework, we identify the celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in the subleading phase space at finite distance by constructing their canonical generators and imposing self-duality conditions. This allows us to define a notion of covariant radiation, whose absence gives rise to an infinite tower of conserved charges, revealing physical quantities relevant to observers near black hole or cosmological horizons. As a concrete illustration, we consider the case of the self-dual Taub-NUT black hole.

Conclusion: 研究为理解d≥2维CFT中双亏格行为提供了新框架，启示了跨阶关系研究。

Abstract: We explore a "genus-2" crossing equation obeyed by CFTs in general dimensions $d\geq 2$. This crossing equation relates two different decompositions of the "genus-2 partition function" -- namely the partition function on the connected sum $M_2=(S^1\times S^{d-1})\sharp (S^1\times S^{d-1})$. The "sunrise" channel decomposition expresses $M_2$ as a pair of three-punctured spheres glued together with cylinders, while the "dumbbell" channel decomposition expresses $M_2$ as a gluing of two one-point functions on $S^1\times S^{d-1}$. We introduce coordinates to describe each channel, and write down Casimir equations obeyed by the corresponding blocks. We also explain why equality between the two channels guarantees mapping class group invariance of the genus-2 partition function in 3d CFTs. As an application of the genus-2 crossing equation, we derive a novel relation between asymptotics of "heavy-heavy-heavier" OPE coefficients and squares of thermal one-point coefficients in 3d CFTs. Along the way, we demonstrate how expectation values of conformal generators can help locate saddle points in large quantum number limits.

Abstract: The CFT dual of string theory on $({\rm AdS}_3 \times {\rm S}^3)/\mathbb{Z}_k\times \mathbb{T}^4$ is believed to be described by the subspace of the symmetric orbifold of $\mathbb{T}^4$ that comprises the low-lying excitations on top of a certain reference state. (This `non-perturbative' reference state lies in the twisted sector associated to the conjugacy class consisting of only $k$-cycles.) In a recent paper we confirmed this picture by analysing the worldsheet theory of the orbifold at the tensionless NS-NS point, and by showing that the perturbative worldsheet spectrum reproduces precisely the single particle excitations on top of this reference state. In this paper we explain that this identification also holds on the level of the correlators, at least to leading order in $1/N$.

Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework to determine scaling dimensions of neutral composite operators in scalar conformal field theories. For the critical Ising $λφ^4$ theory in $d=4-ε$, we obtain the full spectrum of composite operators built out of $n$ fields transforming in the traceless-symmetric Lorentz representations to next-to-leading order in the double-scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $λ\rightarrow 0$ with $λn$ fixed. At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $ε$-expansion for the family of $φ^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.

Abstract: Taking the mass, charge, hair parameter, and cosmological constant of the 5-dimensional de Sitter hairy spacetime as the state variables of a thermodynamic system, and based on the satisfaction of the universal first law of thermodynamics, we obtain the effective thermodynamic quantities of the spacetime. The thermodynamic properties of the system in the coexistence region of the black hole and cosmological horizons are discussed. We find that under certain conditions, the heat capacity of the effective thermodynamic system in the two-horizon coexistence region of de Sitter hairy spacetime, as a function of either temperature or the ratio of the horizon positions, exhibits a peak-like behavior similar to that observed in paramagnetic systems. Further analysis reveals that, under specific conditions, the heat capacity of this effective thermodynamic system in dS spacetime resembles that of a two-level system composed of two horizons with different radiation temperatures. By comparing these results, we derive the expressions for the number of microscopic particles on the two horizons within the coexistence region. This outcome reflects the quantum nature of dS spacetime and provides a new pathway for further in-depth investigation into the thermodynamic and quantum properties of the two-horizon coexistence region in dS spacetime.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy, which is a non-Hermitian generalization of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), is equivalent to the perturbative Einstein equation in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space, assuming the dS/CFT correspondence. Our analysis reveals that the geodesic that accurately satisfies the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy consists of a timelike curve and a curve whose coordinates are complex. We also demonstrate that infinitesimal changes to the pseudo entropy satisfy a Klein-Gordon equation in two-dimensional de Sitter space. These imply the emergence of a time coordinate from a Euclidean CFT in dS/CFT.

Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了微分方程约束和正定性条件，为量子统计力学中的相关函数分析提供了一种新工具。

Abstract: We develop a bootstrap approach to Euclidean two-point correlators, in the thermal or ground state of quantum mechanical systems. We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become "inequalities of motion" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states. Along the way, we provide a new derivation of the energy-entropy balance inequality and establish a connection between the high-temperature two-point correlator bootstrap and the matrix integral bootstrap.

Conclusion: 作者提出了对KR多项式进行简化的新方法，并成功的将其减少到双色情况下的形式，证明了这一方法的有效性和普适性。这对于进一步研究高阶多项式关系具有重要意义。

Abstract: The Khovanov-Rozansky (KR) link polynomial is a certain $t$-deformation of Wilson loops in 3-dimensional $SU(N)$ Chern--Simons topological field theory, believed to be an observable in the refined Chern-Simons theory, probably described in terms of 4d or 5d QFT and related by a certain procedure to the triply-graded link superpolynomial. This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case.

Abstract: We present exact evaluations of superconformal indices for 4d N =1 and N =2 pure Super Yang-Mills theories with arbitrary simple gauge group G. Our approach applies the Macdonald identities for untwisted affine Lie algebras to the integral formulas of the indices, yielding uniform closed formulas valid for all G, expressed both as q-series and as eta-quotients, related through specialized Macdonald identities. Using similar techniques, we also derive exact expressions for half Schur indices with Neumann boundary conditions and uncover a bilinear structure of the full Schur index. Within the framework of holomorphic-topological twists, we further explore connections to the category of line operators, the K-theoretical Coulomb branch, Schur quantization, IR formulas for the BPS spectrum, and class S constructions.

Abstract: We study line defects with a cusp in fermionic CFTs arising as fixed points of scalar-fermion theories with Yukawa interactions. These include the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model and some of its generalizations with additional scalar fields, which can be thought of as UV completions of fermionic theories with quartic interactions. We compute the cusp anomalous dimension in these models to one-loop order in the epsilon expansion near four dimensions, and also to leading order in the large $N$ expansion in $2<d<4$. We discuss several observables that can be extracted from the cusp anomalous dimension, such as the dimensions of the defect changing and defect creation operators, the Casimir energy appearing in the fusion of defects, and the normalization coefficients of the two-point functions of displacement and tilt operators. We provide some estimates of the values of these observables in $d=3$ using the one-loop epsilon expansion and Padé approximants.

### [79] [QCD String Axions and $M$-theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08566)
*Bobby Samir Acharya,Ethan Torres*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了超楊 Illegal M|L 特徵在SU(N≥3)、SO(4N+2)、E₆等群下的存在性，並预测了该项目對超楊M-ブラック洞數值計算的影響。 motivation: The paper addresses the existence of axions in certain SU(N) Yang-Mills theories. method: Uses M-theory and G₂-holonomy metrics. result: Axions exist for specific gauge groups and not for others. conclusion: The axion spectrum depends on the gauge group structure. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the existence of axions in SU(N) Yang-Mills theories and their dependence on the gauge group structure. This is motivated by the observation of long fluxtube strings in QCD and their associated 1-form symmetries, as well as lattice evidence supporting the existence of massive pseudoscalar (axion) fields in such theories. The author aims to clarify this phenomenon within the framework of M-theory and G₂-holonomy metrics.

Method: The paper uses M-theory compactifications on manifolds with G₂ holonomy to model the extra dimensions. This approach allows the author to analyze the spectrum of the Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions and identify the conditions under which axions (massive pseudoscalar particles) appear. The analysis involves studying the geometry of the compactification manifold and its relation to the gauge group structure. The author also draws parallels with the AdS/CFT correspondence, even though the focus here is on holographic realizations specific to Yang-Mills theories.

Result: The main result of the paper is that axions (massive pseudoscalar particles) appear naturally in the realization of 4D $rac{1}{1}$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory from M-theory spacetimes with G₂ holonomy, but only under specific conditions related to the gauge group. Specifically, axions exist in the spectrum of stable QCD strings if and only if the gauge group is SU(N≥3), SO(4N+2), or E₆ (or certain quotients or double-covers of these groups). Conversely, axions are absent from the spectrum of stable QCD strings if the gauge group is SU(2), SO(2N+1), SO(4N), Sp(N), or E₇ (or certain quotients or double-covers of these groups). This result provides a clear classification of the existence of axions in these theories and highlights the role of the gauge group structure in determining their presence or absence.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the presence of axions in the spectrum of stable QCD strings is closely tied to the gauge group of the underlying Yang-Mills theory. This conclusion supports the idea that the axion spectrum depends on the gauge group structure and opens up new avenues for future lattice studies of QCD strings for gauge algebras of B, C, D, and E-type. The findings also suggest that the phenomenon of axion existence is not universal across all SU(N) Yang-Mills theories, but rather depends on specific group-theoretic conditions. These results have implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence and the holographic realization of gauge theories in higher dimensions.

Abstract: In $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without matter, there exist stable long electric fluxtube strings which carry a 1-form symmetry charge. Over the past decade or so, there has been increasing evidence from lattice calculations that the worldsheet theories of such QCD strings contain a massive pseudoscalar (axion), at least when $N\geq 3$. This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy. This picture predicts that QCD string axions exist only if the gauge group is $SU(N\geq 3)$, $SO(4N+2)$, or $E_6$ (or a quotient/double-cover thereof), and is absent from the spectrum of stable QCD strings if the gauge group is $SU(2)$, $SO(2N+1)$, $SO(4N)$, $Sp(N)$, or $E_7$. We argue why we expect this pattern to persist for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills strings, at least for large $N$, something which could be tested in future lattice studies of QCD strings for gauge algebras of B, C, D, and E-type.

Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for solving the initial value problem for relativistic hydrodynamics formulated as a gradient expansion. Secular growth is handled by a suitable covariant resummation scheme, which reorganises the degrees of freedom at each order in the expansion while preserving the sum. Our scheme can be applied to any order in the gradient expansion; we provide the explicit formulation at first and second orders. When working to first order, we find that the BDNK equations of motion emerge as an intermediate step in a calculation performed in the Landau frame. We show that non-hydrodynamic modes appear only in such intermediate calculations and cancel when evaluating solutions to the required order. Our procedure does not introduce any other fields or require any additional initial data beyond those appearing in the theory of ideal fluids.

### [81] [Dual Magnetic and Electric Dipole Symmetry: Pseudo Angular Momentum in Parity Space and the Electric Landé $g$-Factor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07692)
*Michael E. Tobar*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: EDMs are explored through symmetry-based analysis in hydrogen atoms, exploiting duality between magnetic and electric fields. A pseudo-angular momentum $ar{J}_p$ is introduced due to Stark effects, leading to induced EDMs in $2s$ and $2p$ states. A dual framework for EDMs, mirroring magnetic dipole moments, is developed using magnetization formalism, highlighting the role of probability currents in EDM induction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding fundamental symmetries and beyond-the-Standard Model physics requires exploring induced electric dipole moments (EDMs) in hydrogen atoms. This study employs a symmetry-based approach to gain insight into EDM generation under electromagnetic duality.

Method: The analysis incorporates angular momentum theory, symmetry breaking, and magnetization formalism, connecting Stark shifts in hydrogen states to induced EDMs through pseudo-angular momentum and probability currents.

Result: The research establishes that induced EDMs in hydrogen arise from Stark-induced pseudo-angular momentum and probability current circulation. The dual framework connects magnetic and electric dipole moments, offering a new perspective on EDM physics.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of EDM origins in hydrogen, suggesting a symmetry-based mechanism for their generation. The dual formalism provides a complementary approach to study beyond-Standard Model physics through EDM measurements.

Abstract: EDMs probe fundamental symmetries and underpin BSM searches. We give a symmetry-based description, analogous to the Zeeman effect, that puts magnetic and electric dipoles on equal footing under EM duality. In hydrogen, $\vec B$ (pseudovector) couples to $\hat{\vec J}$ and reduces $SO(4)$ to $SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$. A static $\vec E$ (polar) couples within a fixed $n$ to a scaled Runge-Lenz operator $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$, mixes parities, and preserves $SO(2)\times SO(2)$ generated by $\hat J_z$ and $\hat A_{{\rm sc},z}$. This motivates a pseudo-angular momentum $\hat{\vec J}_p$ built from $\hat{\vec A}_{\rm sc}$ and a Landé factor $g_E$, so the orbital dipole is $\hat{\vec d}_{\rm orb}=g_E d_B \hat{\vec J}_p/\hbar$, with $d_B=ea_0=2μ_B/(cα)$. Stark mixing of $2s$ and $2p_{m=0}$ gives $|\langle d_{\rm orb}\rangle|=3d_B$ ($g_E=3$). Following Ohanian's magnetisation formalism, we construct its electric dual: the microscopic polarisation $\vec P$ has nonzero curl, defining a magnetic probability current $\vec J_m=-ε_0^{-1}\nabla\times\vec P$, and the EDM expectation is $\langle \hat{\vec d}_{\rm tot}\rangle=-\frac{ε_0}{2}\int \vec r\times \vec J_m\, d^3r=d_B\big[g_E\langle \hat{\vec J}_p\rangle/\hbar+g_E^{e}\langle \hat{\vec S}\rangle/\hbar\big]$, with $g_E^{e}=2d_{\rm int}/d_B$. Here $\hat{\vec S}$ encodes any intrinsic EDM $d_{\rm int}$, while $\hat{\vec J}_p$ captures the Stark-induced pseudo-angular momentum from Runge-Lenz symmetry. The dual framework shows that induced EDMs arise from circulating magnetic probability currents, mirroring magnetic dipoles from circulating electric probability currents.

Abstract: Cold atomic ensembles offer precise tools for probing near-field interactions, yet experimental data linking atom dynamics to surface-induced forces remains limited. This study investigated the interaction between atoms and a dielectric surface using an atomic fountain measurement technique, in which cold rubidium atoms were released from a moving optical dipole trap. The launched cold atoms were irradiated with an evanescent light detuned from the D$_2$ transition by $-$20.2 to $+$20.2 MHz, after which they were recaptured by reactivating the optical dipole trap. Our measurements revealed that the number of recaptured atoms decreased with increasing flight time, and the decay was suppressed under blue-detuned conditions. We modeled the motion dynamics of the cold atomic ensemble, incorporating Casimir-Polder interactions between the dielectric surface and cold atoms, and observed that the rate of decrease in the number of residual atoms depended on the value of the van der Waals potential coefficient $C_3$. The calculation results demonstrated good agreement with the experimental results, allowing us to estimate $C_3 = 5.6^{+2.4}_{-1.9} \times 10^{-49}$ Jm$^3$ by comparing simulations with the experimental results across various $C_3$ values, accounting for experimental errors.

Abstract: The two-loop electron self-energy correction is one of the most problematic QED effects and, for a long time, was the dominant source of uncertainty in the theoretical prediction of the bound-electron $g$ factor in hydrogen-like ions. A major breakthrough was recently achieved in [B. Sikora et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 123001 (2025)], where this effect was calculated without any expansion in the nuclear binding strength parameter $Zα$ (where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $α$ is the fine-structure constant). In this paper, we describe our calculations of one of the most difficult parts of the two-loop self-energy, represented by Feynman diagrams that are treated in the mixed momentum-coordinate representation.

Motivation: The need for efficient cold atom production, especially for high-flux applications in metrology and quantum technologies.

Method: Utilized two oblique laser beams and a capillary-array collimation system to reduce residual atomic flux and optimize the Zeeman slower.

Result: Achieved a 44 cm compact design with improved atom capture efficiency and reduced contamination, suitable for high-precision applications.

Conclusion: This innovation enhances the performance of cold atom systems, offering reliable and efficient solutions for advanced technologies.

Abstract: We present a compact design of dual-beam Zeeman slower optimized for efficient production of cold atom applications. Traditional single-beam configurations face challenges from substantial residual atomic flux impacting downstream optical windows, resulting in increased system size, atomic deposition contamination, and a reduced operational lifetime. Our approach employs two oblique laser beams and a capillary-array collimation system to address these challenges while maintaining efficient deceleration. For rubidium ($^{87}$Rb), simulations demonstrate a significant increase in the fraction of atoms captured by a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D-MOT) and nearly eliminate atom-induced contamination probability at optical windows, all within a compact Zeeman slower length of 44 cm. Experimental validation with Rb and Yb demonstrates highly efficient atomic loading within the same compact design. This advancement represents a substantial improvement for high-flux cold atom applications, providing reliable performance for high-precision metrology, quantum computation and simulation.

Abstract: We propose a concept for a cryogenic source of atomic tritium at sub-kelvin temperatures and energies suitable for magnetic trapping. The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy.

Method: 通过研究ModMax参数η对测点粒子有效势、角动量和能量的影响，分析了η变化导致的RN(Lorenz-Nocheron)_regime到Schwarzschild极限的转变，以及其对ISCO和Keplerian频率的影响。同时，利用PR、RP、WD和ER模型，研究了QPO半径随η的变化，最后通过Markov Chain Monte Carlo（MCMC）分析，利用来自不同质量黑洞的QPO数据进行参数限制。

Abstract: We analyze the impact of ModMax parameter on the dynamics of test particles around black holes and its effect on the characteristics of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). The effect of the ModMax parameter $η$ is studied using the effective potential, angular momentum and the energy of the circular orbits of the test particles. Our analysis shows that increasing $η$ brings about a continuous transition from the RN regime toward the Schwarzschild limit, accompanied by noticeable modifications in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the corresponding Keplerian frequencies. We also explore the dependence of QPO radii on the ModMax parameter $η$ within the framework of the PR, RP, WD, and ER models. Finally, to place observational constraints, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using QPO data from a range of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive scales.

Starting from the QNM contribution to the Wightman function of a scalar field on a static, spherically symmetric black hole background, we derive the response function of a two-level Unruh--DeWitt detector following simple trajectories (static at fixed radius, with comments on radial free fall). The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit. We discuss several extensions and propose our framework as a unifying language connecting black hole ringdown, near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics, and quantum optics, thereby enriching the emerging program of black hole spectroscopy in the gravitational-wave era.

Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences offer a powerful and reliable probe of General Relativity. To date, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has provided stringent consistency tests of General Relativity predictions. In this work, we present forecasts for the accuracy with which General Relativity can be tested using third-generation ground-based interferometers, focusing on Einstein Telescope (ET) and binary black hole mergers. Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events. We also assess the number of detections required to confidently identify deviations from General Relativity at various post-Newtonian orders and for different detector configurations.

Abstract: The forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should enable the detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object gradually inspirals into a supermassive black hole while emitting gravitational waves. Modeling the waveforms of such systems is a challenging task, requiring precise computation of energy and angular momentum fluxes as well as proper treatment of orbital resonances, during which two fundamental orbital frequencies become commensurate. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits. Building on these insights, we explore the dynamical impact of resonance crossings within the adiabatic approximation. By introducing novel numerical methods, we reduce computational costs and uncover diverse resonance-crossing behaviors. These results contribute to the effort to understand theoretically and model adequately resonance crossings during an EMRI.

Motivation: Classification of spacetimes is a fundamental aspect in differential geometry, aiding understanding of spacetime structure and dynamics.

Abstract: We present a new effective method of algebraic classification of 2+1 geometries. Our approach simply classifies spacetimes using five real scalars, defined as specific projections of the Cotton tensor onto a suitable null basis. The algebraic type of a spacetime is determined by gradual vanishing of these scalars. We derive the Bel-Debever criteria, together with the multiplicity of the Cotton aligned null directions (CANDs). Additionally, we provide a frame-independent algorithm for classification based on the polynomial curvature invariants and show the equivalence to previous methods of classification.

Abstract: We construct a new static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetime embedded in a dark matter halo whose density follows the cored Burkert profile. Starting from the halo-only geometry determined by the rotation curve relation, we solve the Einstein equations with the Burkert stress-energy and enforce a Schwarzschild boundary condition, obtaining closed form metric functions in which the halo contribution deforms the redshift or shape functions and reduces to the Schwarzschild limit when the halo parameters vanish. On this background we study linear perturbations of test fields with spins $s=0,1,2$ and compute their quasinormal spectra using both a high order WKB scheme and continued fraction method, complemented by time domain evolutions. We find that increasing either the Burkert core radius $r_0$ or the central density $ρ_0$ generically shifts the real part of the frequencies upward and enhances damping, while the multipole index $l$ primarily increases the oscillation frequency with a milder impact on the decay rate. The two frequency extraction methods agree to within small, systematic offsets across the explored parameter space. Our results quantify how a cored dark matter environment imprints itself on the ringdown of a central black hole and provide benchmarks for future gravitational wave tests of halo properties.

### [95] [The Influence of Stable Photon Sphere Advent on Orbital Precession in moving towards the Extremality: Periapsis Shift as a Gateway to the Weak Gravity Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07902)
*Mohammad Ali S. Afshar,Jafar Sadeghi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how a black hole's varying mass, especially in a chaotic timeframe, affects the periapsis shift of nearby particles. It finds that a static mass assumption fails to capture the effect, but incorporating periodic mass changes reveals alignment with the Weak Gravity Conjecture and novel dynamics in extreme conditions, suggesting the periapsis shift could be a viable experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Weak Gravity Conjecture suggests that black holes require stabilization through strong gravity effects, and this paper aims to test its viability in extreme conditions.

Method: The study employs a novel static approximation method to model the orbit of a test particle around a black hole with varying mass, divided into frames with constant mass, allowing the analysis of mass changes over short periods.

Result: The model shows that a varying mass black hole requires a stronger gravity effect to stabilize its orbit, but the Peripheral Shift appears insufficient for such conclusions in certain configurations.

Conclusion: The study concludes that a black hole's mass variation stretches the timescale required for a static model, which could make a weak gravity effect, such as the WGC, necessary to maintain the black hole's stability, but the study makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions.

Abstract: While the effects of solar mass change can be neglected in studies of solar periapsis shifts-given the relevant timescales and magnitude of change-the influence of a black hole's dynamic and chaotic mass variation on the Periapsis Shift of test particles in its surrounding spacetime demands a detailed and meticulous investigation. Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays probe isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds in the nanohertz band but are insensitive to its parity-violating component. Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.

TL;DR: This paper explores the shadow properties of a rotating wormhole in a plasma environment, examining how different parameters influence the shadow's shape and comparing it to black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the shadow properties of exotic objects like wormholes under astrophysical conditions provides insights into their potential detectability and distinguishes them from black holes.

Method: The study uses the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to derive the shadow equation under varying plasma densities, considering a dispersive medium without affecting the wormhole's background geometry.

Result: The shadow is visualized with photon regions, showing how geometric and plasma parameters affect its morphology. Parameters like spin and deviation from Kerr can be constrained using observational data.

Conclusion: While the current constraints are limited, future observational data could tighten these bounds, aiding in distinguishing wormholes from black holes.

Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties in a recently proposed geometry of a rotating wormhole under realistic astrophysical conditions, particularly in the presence of a cold and non magnetized plasma environment surrounding the wormhole throat. Using the Hamilton Jacobi formalism, we derive the orbit equation under specific plasma density profiles, where we consider plasma as dispersive medium and disregard its influence on the background geometry. The electron density distribution is chosen to preserve a generalized Carter constant. We explore the shadow cast by this class of rotating wormhole in the presence of both homogeneous and non homogeneous plasma as seen by an asymptotic observer. The photon regions are visualized, and the influence of geometric parameters, plasma parameters, and the observer inclination angle with the rotation axis on the resulting shadow morphology is analyzed. We tried to implement constraints on the plasma and the geometrical parameters of the wormhole such as the spin parameter and the deviation (from Kerr) parameter in the back drop of recent observational bounds coming from the deviation from circularity of the shadow boundary ($ΔC$) and deviation of the average shadow radius from Schwarzschild ($δ$). The bound on $ΔC$ is satisfied by the theoretically allowed range of parameters thus not found very useful to put any constraint, we could impose stringent constraints on the parameters based on the observed value of $δ$. By comparing the optical characteristics of the image of these wormholes with those of Kerr black holes under analogous plasma conditions, we identify the features that could serve as discriminants for similar types of compact objects.

Abstract: In this work, we study the constraints on the characteristic parameters $(ζ,b)$ of the Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity model in a static and spherically symmetric background, using four classes of high-precision Solar-System experiments: stellar light deflection, Shapiro time delay, perihelion advance, and geodetic precession. From geodesic equations, we derive observable geometric quantities that can be directly compared with VLBI/VLBA astrometry, the Cassini time-delay measurement, MESSENGER data and the GP-B/LLR results. Our results show that a larger value of $b$ suppresses the nonlocal effect more rapidly with radius, thereby weakening the overall constraints on $ζ$. The perihelion advance exhibits the strongest sensitivity to $ζ$ around $b\simeq 1.06$, providing the tightest single experiment bound, whereas away from this region the combined constraint becomes dominated by the Shapiro time delay. Incorporating all four experiments yields a well-defined and sharply bounded allowed region for the parameter space $(ζ,b)$.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are direct probes of cosmological gravity, sensitive to space-time inhomogeneities along their propagation. The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\sim 50\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm.

*M. Mangut,O. Gurtug,M. Halilsoy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper applies the scalar quantum probe method to the Curzon solution in general relativity, revealing that the singularity at r=0 is regularized by scalar quantum fields, while an additional off-center singularity appears in charged cases, which is not regularized quantum mechanically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original motivation for this paper probably stemmed from the interest in studying quantum effects on singularities, which is a significant topic in theoretical physics, particularly in understanding the limitations of classical general relativity and the potential implications for a theory of quantum gravity.

Method: The authors employed the scalar quantum probe method, a technique used to analyze the stability of spacetimes under quantum perturbations. This method involves quantizing a scalar field propagating in the spacetime and analyzing the behavior near the singularity.

Result: The main findings of the paper reveal that for the uncharged Curzon spacetime, the scalar quantum probe method successfully regularizes the classical singularity at r=0, meaning that at this point, the spacetime becomes non-singular in the quantum realm. However, for the charged Curzon spacetime, despite the presence of additional off-center singularities, these do not receive the same regularization by the scalar quantum probe method. This suggests that classically strong singularities may be weaker in a quantum sense when the spacetime is uncharged, but quantum effects do not necessarily resolve the compulsory singularities in charged scenarios.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper suggests that quantum mechanics can potentially resolve singularities in spacetime that are classically very strong, such as in the uncharged Curzon solution. However, for charged scenarios, this regularization does not occur, implying that the nature of singularities in general relativity may be more complex than previously thought, and that additional factors, such as charge, may play a crucial role in determining the quantum behavior of spacetime.

Abstract: The scalar quantum probe method developed by Horowitz and Marolf is applied to the cylindrically symmetric Curzon solution. The main cause for choosing the Curzon solution is that it is the best known example that exhibits directional singularity. Interestingly the singularity at $r=0$, for the uncharged Curzon spacetime, which is classically very strong with a divergence rate of the order $\frac{1}{r^{10}}$ becomes regular when examined using scalar quantum field. The charged Curzon spacetime, however, due to the emergence of a second singularity off the $r=0$ singularity does not regularize quantum mechanically. All three different charged versions, i.e. electric, magnetic and dyonic share the same feature.

Method: Analyzes gravitational wave emission from XMRIs to detect deviations from Einstein's general relativity.

Result: Sources with high eccentricity provide tighter constraints on the Chern-Simons parameter ζ.

Conclusion: The detection of these signals offers a promising avenue for distinguishing between general relativity and Chern-Simons modified gravity using astrophysical observations.

Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), formed by brown dwarfs inspiraling into a massive black hole, emit gravitational waves (GWs) that fall within the detection band of future space-borne detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Their detection will measure the astrophysical properties of the MBH in the center of our galaxy (SgrA$^\ast$) with unprecedented accuracy and provide a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Here, we estimate the benefit of using the GWs from XMRIs to constrain the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that XMRI signals radiated from the late stages of the evolution are particularly sensitive to differences between Chern-Simons theory and general relativity. For low-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the Chern-Simons parameter $ζ$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$. For high-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the parameter $ζ$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, using the time-frequency MCMC method, we obtain the posterior distribution of XMRIs in the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that almost all the parameters can be recovered within $1σ$ confidence interval. For most of the intrinsic parameters, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-3}$. For the brown dwarf mass, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-1}$, while for $ζ$, the estimation accuracy reaches $Δ\log_{10}ζ=0.08$ for high eccentricity sources and 1.27 for low eccentricity sources.

Conclusion: 本文通过数值分析和动力学方法研究了Kerr-Newman- Melvin时空中的粒子运动行为，发现引入swirling 效应显著增强了系统的混乱性。实验结果验证了理论分析的正确性，同时也为未来研究黑洞的动力学行为提供了新的参考。

Abstract: We employ the Poincaré section, fast Lyapunov indicator, recurrence analysis, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction to investigate the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles around a new dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe presented in [A. Di Pinto, S. Klemm, and A. Viganò, J. High Energy Phys. {\bf 06}, 150 (2025)]. We note that the swirling parameter $j$ and magnetic field strength $B$ make the equations of motion for particles nonseparable, and confirm the presence of chaotic behavior in the motion in this dyonic Kerr-Newman-Melvin-swirling spacetime and its sub-cases by removing the conical singularities and removing both the conical singularities and the Dirac strings. We observe that both the number of chaotic orbits and the chaotic region increase with the increase of the parameters $j$ and $B$, but decrease as the electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $H$ or spin parameter $a$ increases. Moreover, we find that the presence of $j$ changes the ranges of $B$, $Q$, $H$ and $a$ where the chaotic motion appears for particles. The swirling parameter together with the magnetic field strength, electric charge, magnetic charge and spin parameter yields richer physics in the motion of particles for the spacetime of a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe.

Abstract: We test dark-energy-motivated screening mechanisms with near-Earth space-based measurements. Within a post-Newtonian treatment, we compute leading corrections to three observables, namely geodetic precession (Gravity Probe B), pericenter advance of LAGEOS-2, and Sagnac time delay in a prospective orbital configuration. We then map these corrections to bounds on chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton models. LAGEOS-2 data yield the strongest Earth-orbit limits for symmetron and dilaton models, while a prospective Sagnac setup provides the tightest constraint for chameleons. These results highlight the relevance of low-density, space-based experiments as sensitive probes of screened dark energy and exclude previously allowed regions of parameter space.

Abstract: We study gravitational wave emission from periodic orbits of a test particle around a noncommutative-inspired black hole surrounded by quintessence. Using the zoom-whirl taxonomy, which is characterized by three topological numbers $(z, w, v)$, we classify these orbits and calculate several representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits. We find that the noncommutative parameter $Θ$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $Θ$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. These results suggest that future space-based gravitational wave missions could probe or constrain noncommutative effects in strong gravitational fields.

Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.

Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy offers great potential to surpass fluorescent-based approaches, owing to the sharp linewidth of Raman vibrations amenable to super-multiplex cell imaging, but currently lacks one crucial component: genetically encodable tags equivalent to fluorescent proteins. Here, we show that infrared fluorescent proteins (IRFPs) can be used as genetically encoded SRS probes and benefit from the electronic pre-resonant SRS enhancement effect with near-infrared exciting pulses, comparable to synthetic dyes reported in the literature. SRS imaging of the nucleus in mammalian cells is demonstrated where a histone protein is fused to an IRFP. This work opens the route towards Raman-based cell imaging using genetically encoded probes, motivating efforts in solving the challenges of photostability and creating a vibrational palette.

Abstract: We show how to add dynamic correlation to a reference seniority-zero wavefunction by making a unitary transformation of the true electronic Hamiltonian into seniority-zero form. The transformation is treated via the Baker Campbell Hausdorff (BCH) expansion and the seniority-zero structure of the reference is exploited to evaluate the first three commutators exactly; the remaining contributions are handled with a recursive commutator approximation, as is typical in canonical transformation methods. By choosing a seniority-zero reference and using parallel computation, this method is practical for small- to medium-sized systems. Numerical tests show high accuracy, with errors $\sim 10^{-4}$ Hartree.

Conclusion: 通过双催化剂协同优化设计，可以有效提高电化学二氧化碳还原反应的产率和选择性。

Abstract: Tandem catalysis involves two or more catalysts arranged in proximity within a single reaction vessel. Each catalyst prefers different reaction pathways and products, and so the tandem design synergistically seeks to leverage the strengths of each and maximize overall system performance and efficiency. This study presents the integration of continuum transport modeling with design optimization in a simplified two-dimensional flow reactor setup for electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction, as a proof of concept towards constructing an optimization-based reactor design framework. Ag catalysts provide the CO$_2$ $\rightarrow$ CO reaction capability, and Cu catalysts provide the CO $\rightarrow$ high-value products reaction capability. Given a set of input parameters -- applied surface voltage, electrolyte flow rate, and number of catalyst sections -- the optimization algorithm uses adjoint methods to modify the Ag/Cu surface patterning in order to maximize the current density toward high-value products, such as ethylene. The optimized designs, which strongly depend on these input parameters, yield significant performance enhancement especially at more negative applied voltages (i.e., stronger surface reactions) and for larger numbers of patterning sections. For an applied voltage of $-1.7$ V vs. SHE, the $12$-section optimized design increases the current density towards ethylene by up to $65\%$ compared to the unoptimized $2$-section design. Observed differences in the production and consumption of CO (the key intermediate species) provide insight into increased ethylene production in the optimized cases. The concentration fields highlight how optimized patterns minimize zones of low reactant concentration on the catalyst surface to increase production of high-value further-reduced products.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding complex chemical kinetics, especially in combustion, is crucial for engineering applications. Traditional approaches like Troe or PLOG are limited. KA-CRNNs address this by incorporating pressure dependence directly from data, enhancing accuracy and generalization.

Method: KA-CRNNs extend CRNNs by using Kolmogorov-Arnold activations to model pressure-dependent rate parameters. This maintains interpretability while capturing complex behaviors. The method was tested on the CH3 recombination reaction.

Result: KA-CRNNs demonstrated superior performance, accurately reproducing pressure-dependent kinetics across varying temperatures and pressures. This shows the potential of the framework for other complex reacting systems.

Conclusion: KA-CRNNs provide a physically consistent, interpretable method for discovering pressure-dependent kinetics, advancing chemical model inference in combustion and chemical systems.

Abstract: Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (CRNNs) have emerged as an interpretable machine learning framework for discovering reaction kinetics directly from data, while strictly adhering to the Arrhenius and mass action laws. However, standard CRNNs cannot represent pressure-dependent rate behavior, which is critical in many combustion and chemical systems and typically requires empirical formulations such as Troe or PLOG. Here, we develop Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (KA-CRNNs) that generalize CRNNs by modeling each kinetic parameter as a learnable function of system pressure using Kolmogorov-Arnold activations. This structure maintains full interpretability and physical consistency while enabling assumption-free inference of pressure effects directly from data. A proof-of-concept study on the CH3 recombination reaction demonstrates that KA-CRNNs accurately reproduce pressure-dependent kinetics across a range of temperatures and pressures, outperforming conventional interpolative models. The framework establishes a foundation for data-driven discovery of extended kinetic behaviors in complex reacting systems, advancing interpretable and physics-consistent approaches for chemical model inference.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of electronic wavefunctions is central to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and electronic structure theory. However, conventional ab initio methods require self-consistent optimization of electronic states at every nuclear configuration, leading to prohibitive computational costs, especially for large or strongly correlated systems. Here, we introduce a quantum-centric machine learning (QCML) model-a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with Transformer-based machine learning to directly predict molecular wavefunctions and quantum observables. By pretraining the Transformer on a diverse dataset of molecules and ansatz types and subsequently fine-tuning it for specific systems, QCML learns transferable mappings between molecular descriptors and PQC parameters, eliminating the need for iterative variational optimization. The pretrained model achieves chemical accuracy in potential energy surfaces, atomic forces, and dipole moments across multiple molecules and ansatzes, and enables efficient AIMD simulations with infrared spectra prediction. This work establishes a scalable and transferable quantum-centric machine learning paradigm, bridging variational quantum algorithms and modern deep learning for next-generation molecular simulation and quantum chemistry applications.

Abstract: Molecules that violate Hund's rule by exhibiting an inverted singlet-triplet gap (STG), where the first excited singlet (S$_1$) lies below the triplet (T$_1$), are rare but hold great promise as efficient fifth-generation light emitters. Azaphenalenes (APs) represent one of the few known molecular classes capable of such inversion of the S$_1$/T$_1$ energy ordering, yet a systematic exploration of all unique APs is lacking. Here, we investigate 104 distinct APs and classify them based on their adherence to or deviation from Hund's rule using S$_1$-T$_1$ gaps computed with the Laplace-transformed second-order coupled-cluster method (L-CC2). To capture substitution-dependent pseudo-Jahn-Teller distortions that are inadequately described by MP2 and DFT methods, we employ an extrapolative geometry scheme to estimate equilibrium structures at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level. We find three APs to undergo $D_{\rm 3h} \rightarrow C_{\rm 3h}$ and ten to show $C_{\rm 2v}\rightarrow C_{\rm s}$ symmetry lowering, leading to a total of 117 configurations of 104 unique APs. Our study identifies top candidates with inverted STGs, revealing how substitution and symmetry-lowering modulate these gaps to uncover new stable AP cores that provide promising targets for designing molecular light-emitters.

TL;DR: The paper explores how nuclear-magnetic resonance experiments using different shuttling and detecting conditions in a ZULF setup can reveal non-trivial molecular behavior like varying relaxation rates depending on field strength, measurement setup, and detection method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding molecular tumbling in different magnetic fields and detection setups is crucial for advancing NMR in metabolomics, imaging, and structural biology.

Method: NMR experiments under varying conditions (pre-polarizing fields, detection regions, measurement fields, detection methods, nutation angles) were conducted on 13C-labeled formic acid using an atomic-magnetometer-based ZULF setup. Data analysis involved matching spin relaxation rates to theoretical models.

Result: Different experimental conditions led to varying relaxation rates. Theoretical models successfully explained these variations and were validated experimentally.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for interpreting ZULF relaxation rates under various conditions, opening new applications like spectral assignment, motional regime characterization, contrast enhancement, and relaxation process mapping in metabolites below 1 microtesla.

Abstract: Nuclear-magnetic-resonance experiments can interrogate a broad spectrum of molecular-tumbling regimes and can accurately measure interatomic distances in solution with sub-nanometer resolution. In the zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) regime, population and coherence decay reveal nontrivial behavior due to strong coupling between nuclear spins. We note, in particular, the surprising effects that different resonances show different relaxation rates, depending on (i) the (pre)polarizing magnet field and the shuttling trajectory to the detection region at nano- and microtesla fields, (ii) the strength of the measurement field, (iii) the detection method (single-channel or quadrature), and even (iv) the nutation angle induced by the excitation pulse. We describe herein experimental data of relaxation rates measured for a 13C-labeled formic acid sample, with an atomic-magnetometer-based ZULF setup, and develop a theoretical framework to explain the detected effects and extract molecular properties. The observed effects could be used for spectral assignment, for the establishment of specific motional regimes, for image contrast, and for the characterization of relaxation processes at nano- to microtesla magnetic fields.

Abstract: The ability to rapidly manipulate domain walls (DWs) in magnetic materials is key to developing novel high-speed spintronic memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics.

Abstract: We formulate gradient flow dynamics generated by two natural actions of the quantum metric for an isolated set of Bloch bands. Specializing to two spatial dimensions, we derive Bogomolny-type lower bounds that relate these actions to the Chern number and show that the bounds are saturated by (anti-)holomorphic projector configurations. Along the flows, the actions decrease monotonically while the Chern number is conserved, giving a constructive route to simplify models within a fixed topological phase toward canonical, low-complexity representatives.

Abstract: Quantum dot superparticles are a specific class of metamaterials created through the self-assembly of nanometer semiconductor quantum dots into organized micro-scale structures, such as microspheres. Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle.

Abstract: By applying the conventional two-liquid model to the magnetoresistivity tensor, we reveal a record-high carrier mobility for surface states in tetradymite topological insulators ($\sim$ 20000 cm$^2$/Vs) in both bulk crystals and thin flakes of Sn-Bi$_{1.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$Te$_2$S. Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators.

Abstract: We investigate localization transition in an open quasiperiodic ladder where the quasiperiodicity is described by the Aubry-André-Harper model. While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate and exploit the photoresponse properties of molybdenum disulfide, a 2D transition-metal dichalcogenide, for applications in optoelectronics.

Method: The researchers use carrier-envelope-phase (CEP)-controlled, ultrafast laser pulses to induce photocurrents in mono-, bi-, and tri-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) devices, measuring the two-terminal current response.

Result: The photocurrent exhibits a quadratic dependence on the applied electric field, distinct from the tunnelling effects seen in strong fields, indicating that MoS₂ exhibits perturbative carrier dynamics in the weak-field limit. This finding extends the understanding of light-field sensitive current control to oxides and semiconductors beyond the bulk dielectric and semiconductor realms, suggesting broader applications for these materials in electric field sensitive optoelectronic devices.

Conclusion: The results establish a new framework for controlling and utilizing light-field sensitive currents in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides, opening up possibilities for electric field sensitive optoelectronic applications, such as sensors and optoelectronic switches.

Abstract: We demonstrate carrier-envelope-phase (CEP)-controlled photocurrents in mono-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS$_2$ driven by few-cycle laser pulses. The photocurrent in the two-terminal devices scales quadratically with the field amplitude, indicating perturbative carrier dynamics in the weak-field regime distinct from strong-field tunnelling. Our results extend light-field-sensitive current control from bulk dielectrics, semiconductors, and graphene to two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting their potential for electric-field sensitive optoelectronics.

Method:  theoretical study of electron cooling using superconducting tunnel junctions with pi phase difference and ferroelectric layers

Result:  the setup allows for effective electron cooling with a complex entropy structure

Conclusion:  investigation contributes to understanding electron cooling mechanisms through unique material systems

Abstract: We study theoretically a process of cooling electrons using a superconducting tunnel junction with a $π$ phase difference and a usual insulator or a ferroelectric in-between, and an array of such junctions with ferroelectric layers in-between. These setups have a complex structure of entropy due to nodal lines, where the density of states can be divergent or larger than for a free electron gas at a chemical potential level. We consider a small current running from the bath of electrons through the setup, where electrons have to have higher entropy, and thus remove heat from the bath.

Abstract: In altermagnets, the magnon bands are anisotropically spin-split in reciprocal space without relativistic or dipolar spin-spin interactions. In this work, we theoretically study magnons and phonons coupled by spin-lattice interaction in a two-dimensional square-lattice $d$-wave altermagnet. We show that phonon-chirality-selective magnon-phonon hybridization can be caused by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to the emergence of hybrid quasiparticles that possess finite phonon angular momentum. These hybrid quasiparticles are called magnon polarons and consist of spin-polarized magnons and chiral phonons. Their phonon angular momentum texture follows the $d$-wave character of the magnon spin texture opening up the possibility of phononic counterparts to the electronic response effects in altermagnets, such as a \emph{phonon angular momentum splitter effect}, i.e., the generation of a transverse phonon angular momentum current induced by a temperature gradient -- the bosonic analogue of the spin-splitter effect.

Abstract: In Szilard's engine, measurement and feedback allows to extract work from an equilibrium environment, a process otherwise forbidden by the laws of thermodynamics. Recent theoretical developments have established fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations that constrain the fluctuations in Szilard's engine. These relations rely on auxiliary experimental protocols known as backward experiments. Here, we experimentally investigate the thermodynamics of Szilard's engine by implementing two distinct types of backward experiments. We verify and compare the corresponding fluctuation theorems and thermodynamic uncertainty relations associated with each protocol. Our results reveal that the entropy production inferable from measurement may serve as a more relevant quantifier of information than the widely used mutual information.

### [124] [Dynamics of chemo-receptor activity with time-periodic attractant field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07868)
*Ramesh Pramanik,Ramu K Yadav,Sakuntala Chatterjee*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates how E. coli cells respond to time-periodic chemical signals, specifically focusing on the modulation of receptor activity, phase lag, and how these factors are influenced by the signal frequency. Numerical simulations reveal that the amplitude of the activity response increases with frequency but eventually decreases, while the phase lag increases and saturates at 3π/2 for high frequencies. The study also finds that the activity becomes a multi-valued function of the signal concentration, leading to loops when plotting activity against concentration over time. The paper explains these observations by considering the interplay of adaptation, activity switching, and signal variation time scales, with particular attention to the regime of very high frequencies where the quasi-equilibrium approximation breaks down. Analytical calculations in this limit support the simulation results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cellular response to external signals is a fundamental topic in molecular biology and microbiology, and understanding how cells modulate their behavior in response to periodic signals is particularly important for designing synthetic biological systems or controlling bacterial populations in biotechnological applications. This paper contributes to this field by providing a detailed analysis of the frequency-dependent behavior of E. coli receptors.

Method: The study uses a combination of theoretical modeling and numerical simulations. The authors set up a mathematical model describing the dynamics of E. coli receptor activity in response to a time-periodic chemical signal and then use numerical simulations to explore how the amplitude and phase of the activity response vary with frequency. Analytical calculations are performed in the limit of very high frequencies to validate the simulation results.

Result: The key findings of the paper are: (1) the amplitude of receptor activity increases with frequency, reaches a plateau, and then decreases for very high frequencies; (2) the phase lag increases monotonically with frequency and eventually saturates at 3π/2; (3) the activity becomes a multi-valued function of the signal concentration at high frequencies, leading to loops in the activity-concentration plot over time; and (4) the authors provide an analytical explanation for these results by considering the interplay of different time scales in the system.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the frequency-dependent response of E. coli cells to time-periodic chemical signals. The findings reveal how the amplitude, phase, and multi-valued nature of the response change with frequency and highlight the role of different time scales in the system dynamics. This work contributes to our understanding of how cells process and respond to environmental signals and opens up new avenues for further research into the mechanisms underlying these responses.

Abstract: When exposed to a time-periodic chemical signal, an \textit{E.~coli} cell responds by modulating its receptor activity in a similar time-periodic manner. However, there exists a phase lag between the applied signal and the activity response. We study the variation of the activity amplitude and phase lag as a function of the applied frequency~$ω$, using numerical simulations. The amplitude increases with~$ω$, reaches a plateau, and then decreases again for large~$ω$. The phase lag increases monotonically with~$ω$ and finally saturates to $3π/2$ when~$ω$ is large. The activity is no longer a single-valued function of the attractant signal, and plotting activity versus attractant concentration over one complete time period generates a loop. We monitor the loop area as a function of~$ω$ and find two peaks for small and large~$ω$, and a sharp minimum at intermediate~$ω$ values. We explain these results as an interplay between the time scales associated with adaptation, activity switching, and applied signal variation. In particular, for very large~$ω$, the quasi-equilibrium approximation for activity dynamics breaks down, a regime that has not been explored in earlier studies. We perform analytical calculations in this limit and find good agreement with our simulation results.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised deep learning approach for computing the ground state (GS) of rotating Bose-Einstein condensation. To minimize the energy under a mass constraint, our approach introduces two key and novel ingredients: a normalized loss function that exactly enforces the mass constraint, and a training strategy named virtual rotation acceleration that is essential for avoiding local minima and guiding the learning process to the correct quantized vortex phase. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed approach as an effective and accurate method to predict GS across physical conditions--from slow to fast rotation and from isotropic to anisotropic confinement. Through further distillation, we establish a unified operator network capable of efficiently generalizing physical parameters across different phases. It enables rapid GS predictions while correctly capturing phase transitions and is applied for inverse problems.

Our single-shot microscopic images together with the real-time readout of the cavity photons provide access to atom-photon correlations. We use this capability to investigate order fluctuations as a function of time following a quench and to directly confirm the correspondence between optical and atomic observables. Our system opens rich perspectives, from local patterning to correlation measurements in long-range interacting quantum gases.

Abstract: We present a scalable method for electrically tuning multiple spatially separated quantum dots embedded in photonic crystal waveguides. Ion implantation into the top p-doped layer of a p-i-n diode creates high-resistivity tracks, providing electrical isolation between adjacent regions. Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In a manner commensurate to the SU(2) gadget for the Poincaré sphere, which involves a combination of two quarter-wave plates and one half-wave plate regardless of their sequential order, an analogous construct for the higher-order Poincaré sphere had long remained elusive. To address this, we recently demonstrated, by modifying Euler-angle parameterization, that an optical gadget consisting of two quarter-wave $q$-plates and one half-wave $q$-plate, each endowed with the same topological charge $q$, operates as a viable SU(2) gadget for the higher-order Poincaré sphere, contingent upon the fulfillment of the holonomy condition. This work presents the controlled navigation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere through the proposed architecture, formulated under the concept of an effective waveplate and thus can be referred to as an effective SU(2) gadget. The notion of an effective waveplate refers to a coaxial arrangement of multiple waveplates that, under specific constraints, can act as a single waveplate. In this gadget, the relative alignment of the offset angles of the constituent $q$-plates emerges as the decisive parameter governing systematic navigation on the higher-order Poincaré sphere. This study bear direct relevance to the deterministic control and engineering of structured light, encompassing polarization singularities, vector vortex beams and topological optical fields. Moreover, these results holds potential applications in the contemporary research frontiers in singular optics, spin-orbit photonics and quantum communication.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Light propagation through turbulence produces speckles, whose ensemble behavior is typically characterized by snapshot intensity statistics. Here, we track the spatiotemporal evolution of individual speckles and quantify fragmentation, localization, and persistence under different diffraction and turbulence scales. Beam fragmentation coincides with complete spatial decorrelation defined by the magnitude-squared coherence. Fragmentation occurs closer to the source for larger beams, which indicates that smaller beams are more robust to decoherence. Subsequently, speckles are both spatially localized and persistent over distances significantly longer than their associated Rayleigh length. The combination of localization and persistence impacts the statistics of light relevant to their long-distance signaling and sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of detecting gases with high sensitivity using integrated photonic sensors, which currently struggle with weak light-gas interaction.

Method: The dual slow-light scheme is developed to enhance PTS sensitivity. The method involves engineering the PhCW to generate structural slow light, which improves pump absorption and probe phase modulation. The sensor is implemented using a CMOS-compatible silicon platform with a 1-mm-long sensing PhCW in a stabilized on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

Result: The sensor achieves a photothermal efficiency of 3.6x10-4 rad cm ppm-1 mW-1 m-1 and a NEAL of 1.4x10-6, among the best reported photonic waveguide gas sensors.

Conclusion: This approach paves the way for high-sensitive, miniaturized, and cost-effective integrated photonic gas sensors.

Abstract: Integrated photonic sensors have attracted significant attention recently for their potential for high-density integration. However, they face challenges in sensing gases with high sensitivity due to weak light-gas interaction. Slow light, which dramatically intensifies light-matter interaction through spatial compression of optical energy, provides a promising solution. Herein, we demonstrate a dual slow-light scheme for enhancing the sensitivity of photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) with a suspended photonic crystal waveguide (PhCW) on a CMOS-compatible silicon platform. By tailoring the dispersion of the PhCW to generate structural slow light to enhance pump absorption and probe phase modulation, we achieve a photothermal efficiency of 3.6x10-4 rad cm ppm-1 mW-1 m-1, over 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the strip waveguides and optical fibers. With a 1-mm-long sensing PhCW incorporated in a stabilized on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a footprint of 0.6 mm2, we demonstrate acetylene detection with a sensitivity of 1.4x10-6 in terms of noise-equivalent absorption and length product (NEAL), the best among the reported photonic waveguide gas sensors to our knowledge. The dual slow-light enhanced PTS paves the way for integrated photonic gas sensors with high sensitivity, miniaturization, and cost-effective mass production.

Motivation: Understanding equilibration in discrete-time lattice systems has implications for quantum optics and wave turbulence.

Method: Numerical simulations of photonic circuits and time-multiplexed fibers were conducted to study equilibration processes.

Result: Discrete-step evolution causes equilibration to a state with equal modal occupation, mimicking infinite temperature. Floquet channels accelerate this process.

Conclusion: Discrete time fundamentally changes thermalization dynamics, affecting weak wave turbulence theory and quantum simulations.

Abstract: Particles subject to weak contact interactions in a finite-size lattice tend to thermalise. The Hamiltonian evolution ensures energy conservation and the final temperature is fully determined by the initial conditions. In this work we show that equilibration processes are radically different in lattices subject to discrete-step unitary evolution, which have been implemented in photonic circuits, coin polarisation walkers and time-multiplexed pulses in fibres. Using numerical simulations, we show that weak nonlinearities lead to an equilibrium state of equal modal occupation across all the bands, i.e, a thermal state with infinite temperature and chemical potential. This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps. We show that by engineering the temporal periodicity inherent to these systems, equilibration can be accelerated through resonant Floquet channels. Our results demonstrate that discrete time plays a crucial role in wave dynamics, fundamentally altering thermalisation processes within weak wave turbulence theory.

Abstract: Hybrid photonic platforms are essential for integrating light sources with scalable on-chip optical circuits.

The deposition process of Ta2O5 was optimized by examining the influence of oxygen flow on film stoichiometry during electron beam evaporation. High quality ring resonators (Q>10000) coupled to bus waveguides were fabricated and measured. Furthermore, we realised a hybrid Ta2O5 - hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) photonic device in which ensembles of B-centre defects were generated and preserved throughout fabrication. These results establish a robust material framework for the integration of defect-based quantum emitters with low-loss dielectric photonics.

Abstract: Optomechanical sensors enable exquisitely sensitive force measurements, with emerging applications across quantum technologies, standards, fundamental science, and engineering. Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration.

Conclusion: Responses address experimental concerns, reaffirm conclusions on pulse characteristics and validity.

Abstract: We recently reported a refine analysis of a previously conducted soft X-ray (SXR) attosecond streaking measurement [1], employing the Variational Phase Gradient Temporal Analysis (VPGTA) retreival algorithm [2]. This re-evaluation, prompted by new metrological insights, revealed a 19.2 attosecond pulse - consistent with the expectations and estimates of our earlier work [3]. Shortly thereafter, a comment by M. Han [4] challenged our findings, citing "physical and technical issues concerning the original experiment and the new characterisation" inclusing purported contributions from Auger electrons, unfiltered low-energy harmonics, and uncompensated intrinsic chirp. These concerns, however, stem from misinterpretation of the experimental regime, selective citation of context, and disregard for well-established results in the peer-reviewed literature. In this reply, we address and clarify these points, demonstrating that the issues raised are not relevant under our experimental conditions. Given the highly specialized nature of attosecond genertaion and metrology in the soft X-ray water-window regime, we consider it essential to clarify these aspects of different regimes and reaffirm teh validity of our conclusions.

Abstract: Topological phases in exciton-polaritons and other metamaterial platforms have attracted significant attention due to their flexibility as Hamiltonian simulators. In previous works, signatures of topology have mainly been investigated from the perspective of edge states - strongly localised modes with exponentially decaying intensity into the bulk. While these edge states have become the hallmark of topological systems as they can facilitate non-reciprocal transport in potential applications, the topology is fundamentally encoded in the bulk band structure. In particular, the momentum-dependence of the eigenstates, i.e., the wave functions, determines the topology, usually reflected in a bulk band inversion. We present a band inversion in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, characterised by a reversal of the sublattice symmetry, quantified by the expectation value $\langle σ_\mathrm{x} \rangle$, when going from the centre of the Brillouin zone to the zone boundary. Here, we show direct experimental access to this bulk band inversion in SSH exciton-polariton chains, using two-dimensional momentum-space ($k$-space) mapping - without the need for real-space imaging. This technique enables the direct observation of the momentum-dependent inversion of the sublattice symmetry in the bulk bands, providing a unique perspective on topological phases beyond conventional edge state measurements. Our approach establishes effective momentum-resolved sublattice phase measurements as a powerful tool for accessing the wave function and bulk topology in photonic and polaritonic systems and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing high-brightness electron beams is crucial for X-ray applications. Current limitations include rf breakdowns, so this work explores using compressed pulses to overcome them.

Method: The method involves designing and testing the CUPID photogun, which uses klystron-powered rf pulses and rf pulse compression. Numerical simulations of beam dynamics and integration with the LCLS system are employed.

Result: Results include achieving 300 MW at 20 ns, a 60 nm emittance electron beam, and mJ pulse energies in the 40 keV range.

Conclusion: This system successfully demonstrates high-brightness electron beams, opening new possibilities for advanced X-ray applications.

Abstract: One pathway to producing high brightness electron beams is to use a radio-frequency (rf) driven high field photogun to rapidly accelerate photoemitted electrons to the relativistic regime and pre- serve the brightness. However, the highest attainable field is limited by rf breakdowns of materials used in a photogun. Shortening rf pulse duration feeding into a photogun provides a viable path- way to achieve high field and prevent rf breakdowns. Here we propose and investigate Compressed Ultrashort Pulse Injector Demonstrator (CUPID), a nanosecond rf pulses driven photogun powered by a klystron and rf pulse compression system capable of achieving 300 MW at 20 ns duration, to produce bright electron beams with high electric field. We first introduce the design of the CUPID photogun and its expected rf performance at 500 MV/m driven by high power nanosecond rf pulses, followed by beam dynamics studies showing its capability for producing bright electron beams with 60 nm emittance when forming a photoinjector with a superconducting solenoid and downstream accelerating structures. Finally, we show a proof-of-concept start-to-end simulation of the CUPID photoinjector paired with the existing Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) copper accelerator free-electron laser (FEL) to demonstrate achievable mJ pulse energy very hard x-ray photons at 40 keV or higher.

TL;DR: A paper demonstrates the construction and operation of a 15 MV/m SRF accelerator achieving 10-year-old performance exceeding APEX LCLS II.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard X-ray FELs require high-quality, continuous electron beams; existing accelerator technology can now meet this need.

Method: An SRF gun is used with a 350 ps electron bunch; bunch compression generates 15 ps FWHM bunches with excellent emittance.

Result: The system achieves 100 pC, 0.2 mm-mrad slice emittance, 0.25 mm-mrad projected emittance.

Conclusion: Existing SRF accelerators can efficiently generate suitable electron beams for hard X-ray FELs, eliminating the need for new, expensive systems.

Abstract: SRF CW accelerator constructed for Coherent electron Cooling (CeC) Proof-of-principle (POP) experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory has frequently demonstrated record parameters using 1.5 nC 350 ps long electron bunches, typically compressed to FWHM of 30 ps using ballistic compression. We report experimental demonstration of CW electron beam with parameters fully satisfying requirements for hard X-ray FEL and significantly exceeding those demonstrated by APEX LCLS II electron gun. This was achieved using a 10-year-old SRF gun with a modest accelerating gradient of $\sim$15 MV/m, a bunching cavity followed by ballistic compression to generate 100 pC, $\sim$15 ps FWHM electron bunches with a normalized slice emittance of $\sim$0.2 mm-mrad and a normalized projected emittance of $\sim$0.25 mm-mrad. Hence, in this paper, we present an alternative method for generating CW electron beams for hard-X-ray FELs using existing and proven accelerator technology. We present a description of the accelerator system settings, details of projected and slice emittance measurements as well as relevant beam dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: 研究为复杂微观结构分析提供了新的理论和工具，具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: To describe longitudinal fine structure like microbunching within a particle beam, a classical approach is to define a bunching factor which is the Fourier transform of the particle longitudinal density distribution. Such a 1D definition of bunching factor can be generalized to a 6D spectral form function (SFF) to describe more complicated structure in phase space. The complex SFF is another complete description of beam in spectral domain and can offer complementary and valuable insight in beam dynamics study which usually invokes the real particle density distribution. The basic property and Fokker-Planck equation of the SFF is presented, along with its solution in a general coupled linear lattice. The example applications of SFF in electron storage ring physics and laser-induced microbunching are presented.

In this contribution, we present explicit analytical expressions for calculating the number of particles slowly extracted over time, commonly referred to as spills. The proposed formulation enables the semi-analytical determination of an amplitude modulation curve to be applied to the radio-frequency exciter, which flattens the spill macrostructure, a feature of high relevance to all users requiring uniform beam delivery.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development and application of digital RF pulse modulation techniques in a Next Gen LLRF platform for particle accelerators, demonstrating high precision pulse shaping for various functions like phase modulation and beam compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved RF pulse control in modern accelerator systems led to the development of digital modulation techniques, specifically in the NG-LLRF platform.

Method: Digital implementation of amplitude and phase modulations were fully realized in the RFSoC-based NG-LLRF platform, eliminating the need for additional analog components. Experiments were conducted using high-power RF fields and a prototype Cool Copper Collider structure to validate the system's capabilities.

Result: The NG-LLRF platform successfully demonstrated high-precision pulse shaping, enabling advanced functions such as phase modulation, pulse reversal, and beam loading compensation, achieving peak power levels up to 16.45 MW.

Conclusion: This advancement in digital RF pulse modulation offers a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation accelerator systems, reducing reliance on analog components and improving precision and performance.

Abstract: RF pulse modulation techniques are widely applied to shape RF pulses for various types of RF stations of particle accelerators. The amplitude and phase modulations are typically implemented with additional RF components that require drive or control electronics. For the RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) based next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) platform, which we have developed in the last several years, RF modulation and demodulation are fully implemented in the digital domain. Therefore, arbitrary RF pulse shaping can be realized without any additional analogue components. We performed a range of high-power experiments with the NG-LLRF and a prototype Cool Copper Collider (C\(^3\)) structure. In this paper, the RF field measured at different stages with different pulse shapes and peak power levels up to 16.45 MW will be demonstrated and analyzed. The high precision pulse shaping schemes of the NG-LLRF can be applied to realize the phase modulation for a linear accelerator injector, the phase reversal for a pulse compressor, or the modulation required to compensate for the beam loading effect.

### [142] [RSstitcher - Seamless merging 2D diffraction frames for Wide Range Reciprocal Space Mappings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08265)
*Xiaodong Wang,Michael W. M. Jones,Adam Smith*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: Wide Range Reciprocal Space Mapping (WR-RSM) enables visualising multiple hkl spots in a single reciprocal space map, but current commercial software has limitations. An open-source Python program called RSstitcher was developed to merge 2D diffraction frames, allowing WR-RSM implementation on various X-ray diffractometers. The program uses novel conversion equations and was verified with two major 2D X-ray diffraction systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accessible tools for scientific analysis, especially in the field of X-ray diffraction.

Method: An open-source Python program called RSstitcher was developed to merge 2D diffraction frames measured at different cradle tilt angles into WR-RSMs. The program supports converting data using geometric conversion equations and was tested on two major 2D X-ray diffraction systems.

Result: The development of RSsticher enables WR-RSM analysis on various X-ray diffractometers, including those with ω-φ compensated Side Inclination Grazing Incident Diffraction geometry for thin film samples. The tool has been verified to be effective by generating similar WR-RSM results for bulk and thin film samples using two major systems.

Conclusion: RSstitcher fills a gap in accessible software for WR-RSM analysis and provides a solution for scientists to perform comprehensive diffraction analysis without relying on expensive commercial software.

Abstract: Wide Range Reciprocal Space Mapping (WR-RSM) is a technique that allows visualisation of the geometric relationships among multiple hkl spots in a single reciprocal space map. However, current commercial software for reconstructing WR-RSM data suffers from several limitations, hindering its promotion. Here, we develop an open-source python program, named RSstitcher (Reciprocal Space Stitcher), to merge 2D diffraction frames measured at different cradle tilt angles into WR-RSMs, allowing the technique to be implemented on any laboratory X-ray diffractometer equipped with a goniometer cradle and a 2D detector. The conversion equations used in the python program is explained geometrically, including novel WR-RSM measurements in ω-φ compensated Side Inclination Grazing Incident Diffraction geometry for thin film samples. We demonstrate its application using two major 2D X-ray diffraction systems on the market, which generated similar WR-RSM results for bulk and thin film samples.

Abstract: We describe the design concept and estimated performance of an iron-scintillator sampling calorimeter for the future Electron Ion Collider. The novel aspect of this detector is a multi-dimensional readout coupled with foreseen excellent time resolution, enabling time-of-flight capabilities as well as a more compact overall assembly. Machine Learning is used to optimize the detector design, and the highly segmented readout is implemented with Machine Learning algorithms in mind to reach performance levels usually reserved for more complex detector systems. The primary physics objective is to serve as a muon detector/ID system at the EIC as well as provide for the identification and momentum measurement of neutral hadrons. At the EIC, these are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\% are achieved using time-of-flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than has been demonstrated for similar calorimeters that are read out with less granularity.
