A project is therefore under way to link IB3A to an existing\npurification and liquefaction station in a neighboring building through a\ndedicated pipeline. Captured helium will be transferred, purified, reliquefied,\nand returned for reuse, cutting losses and operating costs. This paper details\nthe first two project phases: \"Design and Engineering\" and \"Procurement and\nInstallation.\" The design phase finalizes pipeline specifications, establishes\nflow-control requirements, and resolves integration challenges with existing\ncryogenic infrastructure. The procurement and installation phase covers\nmaterial sourcing, pipeline construction, and deployment of control and\nmonitoring systems to assure reliable, efficient operation. Key technical\nhurdles-route optimization, pressure drop mitigation, and interface\ncompatibility-are discussed alongside implemented solutions.

We show that the\nprobability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time\nuntil the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of\nthe quantum superposition.

Our\nfindings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling\nregime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed\nnew light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8154\u4f53\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u7684Rabi\u632f\u8361\u4e0e\u53cd\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\u9879\uff08CRW\uff09\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u4e8e\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u53cd\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\u9879\u5bf9\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9ad8\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u632f\u8361 beating\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u8026\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bCRW\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Dicke\u6216Pauli-Fierz\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\u9879\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u632f\u8361\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cCRW\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u7684Rabi\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u7684\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c beating\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "CRW\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6781\u5316\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

For this purpose we extend the $p$-brane Aristotelian algebra to the\ndirect sum of two conformal algebras: one with Minkowski signature for the\nlongitudinal directions and a second one with Euclidean signature for the\ntransverse directions. For some cases, it is sufficient to work with a\nsubalgebra of this conformal extension that, instead of two dilatations that\nare isotropic in either the longitudinal or transverse directions, contains a\nsingle dilatation that acts on the longitudinal and transverse directions in an\nan-isotropic way. Using this conformal extension we show how different electric\nand magnetic versions of Aristotelian gravity can be constructed that all have\nthe distinguishing property that they are not invariant under any (Galilean or\nCarrollian) boost symmetry.

We evaluate two candidate mechanisms -- Coulomb\nexplosion and hot electron blast -- by estimating electron emission,\nelectrostatic pressure, and hot electron temperature using the\nRichardson--Dushman equation and two-temperature modeling. Our analysis shows\nthat Coulomb explosion is unlikely under the laser fluence used\n($\\sim$27\\,mJ/cm$^2$), as the estimated electrostatic pressure ($\\sim$4 kPa) is\norders of magnitude below the cohesive strength of Cu. In contrast, hot\nelectron blast is identified as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron\ntemperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa.\nThermal modeling also suggests moderate lattice heating ($\\sim$930\\,K),\nenabling softening and fusion of partially fragmented particles. These results\nconfirm that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven\npredominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics rather than classical melting or\nevaporation. Importantly, this work highlights that reducing hot electron\ntemperature -- such as through double-pulse irradiation schemes -- can\neffectively suppress ablation and expand the sintering window, offering a\npromising strategy for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7528\u98de\u79d2\u6fc0\u5149\u8fdb\u884c\u94dc\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92 sintering \u4e2d\u7684\u7194\u878d\u5d29\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u80fd\u7535\u5b50\u5d29\u89e3\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u8109\u51b2\u7167\u5c04\u51cf\u5c11\u5d29\u89e3\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8 sintering \u7a97\u53e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u98de\u79d2\u6fc0\u5149\u5bf9\u94dc\u7eb3\u7c73\u9897\u7c92\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7194\u878d\u5d29\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u627e\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5236\u9020\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u955c\u83b7\u53d6\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u67e5\u5fb7\u68ee-\u8fbe\u4ec0\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u4e24\u6e29\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u9759\u7535\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u5d29\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u70ed\u7535\u5b50\u5d29\u89e3\u662f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8109\u51b2\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5d29\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6bd4\u80fd\u6fc0\u5149\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u591a\u7684sintering\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u70ed\u7535\u5b50\u5d29\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u64cd\u63a7\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e2d\u56fd\u5728ToPoint\u505a\u94fa\u57ab\u3002"}}

Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase\nemerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional\nsymmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding\nhow quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic\nstate, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting\nphases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly\ncorrelated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase\nand its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to\nthe fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron\ninteractions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo\nscreening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi\nliquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi\nliquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the\nFermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with\nfrequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic\nmetal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results\nidentify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and\noffer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum\ncriticality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u3001Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50 underline \u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u3001Mott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u8054\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb mod\u00e8le \u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u4f53\u74f7\u7816\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u6790\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9 impurity \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548cKondo\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u957f\u671f\u7ea0\u7f20\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\uff0c\u8d39\u7c73\u6db2\u548cMott\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8be5\u76f8\u53d8\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f2a\u95f4\u9699\u76f8\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u4e3a\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b0\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The integration of the degrees of freedom that\ndefine the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the\nEinstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of\nthe particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation,\nanother for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain\npoint, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late\ndark energy can start efficiently.

Furthermore, the network\nmaintains strong performance with only 10k parameters and demonstrates enhanced\nrobustness against random phase perturbations, optical occlusions, and input\nnoise.\n  To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of a\nsingle layer diffractive optical network that achieves such high classification\naccuracy, establishing a new benchmark for compact, robust, and shallow\nphotonic computing architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a compact, single-layer dual-wavelength diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) that significantly outperforms traditional multi-layer networks, achieving high classification accuracy with fewer parameters and demonstrating robustness against noise.", "motivation": "The paper addresses the challenges of conventional multi-layer D2NNs, particularly inter-layer misalignments, and presents a novel approach using wavelength-division multiplexing and differential intensity detection to overcome these issues, aiming to create more efficient and reliable photonic computing architectures.", "method": "The researchers developed a single-layer D2NN that encodes complementary spatial frequency information at two distinct wavelengths, exploiting wavelength-division multiplexing.

Using ray-tracing techniques, we conduct a\ndetailed analysis of the black hole's image, redshift distribution, and\nintensity distributions at different observation frequencies. The results\ndemonstrate that spin has a more significant effect on the distortion of the\ninner shadow than charge, and the observer's inclination angle plays a critical\nrole in shaping the redshift distribution, especially near the innermost stable\ncircular orbit. Additionally, the intensity is found to be higher at 86 GHz\nthan at 230 GHz.

We also discuss the connection between our proposed\nalgorithm and Lindbladian simulation as well as its application to the\ninteracting Hatano-Nelson model, a widely studied non-Hermitian model with rich\nphenomenology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6c42\u89e3\u7ebf\u6027\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u8f85\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u8fdb\u5165\u65e9\u671f\u65e0\u6545\u969c era\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6c42\u89e3\u7ebf\u6027 ODEs \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u8f85\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3002\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53\u7cfb\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u7684ODE\u662fk-local\u65f6\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406(k+1)-local\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e Lindbladian \u6a21\u62df\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728 Hatsugano-Nelson \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u957f\u4e0a\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975eHermitian\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5982Hatsugano-Nelson\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u7ebf\u6027\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u786c\u4ef6\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This is a rather sensational observation\nand there are two possibilities for the nature of these mass-gap region\nastrophysical objects, these are either small black holes that result from the\nmergers of ordinary mass neutron stars, or these are heavy neutron stars. In\nthe line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall\nexamine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity\ninflationary models. These theories are basically scalar-tensor deformations of\nthe Starobinsky inflationary model. We shall present the essential features of\ncosmologically viable and non-viable deformations of the Starobinsky model,\noriginating from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary theories, and we indicate\nwhich models and for which equations of state provide a viable neutron star\nphenomenology. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations using a robust\ndouble shooting LSODA python based code, for the following piecewise polytropic\nequations of state the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the\nENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We confront the resulting phenomenology with\nseveral well known neutron star constraints and we indicate which equation of\nstate and model fits the phenomenological constraints. A remarkable feature,\nalso known from other inflationary attractor models, is that the MPA1 is the\nequation of state which is most nicely fitted the constraints, for all the\ntheoretical models used, and actually the maximum mass for this equation of\nstate is well inside the mass-gap region.

We begin by verifying\nthat the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the\nevent horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The\nKretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns\nout that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and\nrelated quantities are not expanded to second order in $\\Theta$. We derive the\nthermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature\n$T^{(\\Theta,\\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\\Theta,\\ell)}$, and heat capacity\n$C_V^{(\\Theta,\\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\\text{rem}}$ is estimated by\nimposing $T^{(\\Theta,\\ell)} \\to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant\nindicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is\nanalyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using\nthe residue theorem.

The effect is reminiscent of the microeconomic law of diminishing\nreturns: beyond an optimal graph size, further increases yield reduced sensing\nperformance. This saturation and decline in precision are particularly\npronounced under Kac scaling, where both the QFI and spin squeezing plateau or\ndegrade with increasing system size.

Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating\nlarge-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable\nfuture, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we\nintroduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning\nmodels designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor\nwith provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two\npredictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum\nprocessor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential\nin advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a\nquantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling\nefficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of\ntransverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet\nsymmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the\npredictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of\nmagnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,\nquantum-resource-intensive approaches.

Our results highlight the potential of anti-blockade mechanisms\nfor programmable non-thermal dynamics in many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4 Rydberg \u539f\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u4e0b\uff0c\u53cd blockade \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684 Hilbert \u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4e0e\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7ea7\u8054\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u70ed\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53casecondary \u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u53cd blockade \u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u6001\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\u540d\u76ee\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u578b\u6750\u6599\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4 Rydberg \u539f\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86 Hilbert \u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u53cd blockade \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684 Hilbert \u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u548c\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7ea7\u8054\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u70ed\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5c42\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u5e26\u6765\u7684secondary \u5206\u5c42\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Despite this progress, current\nquantum network systems remain limited in scale, are highly\napplication-specific (e.g., for quantum key distribution), and lack a clear\nroad map for global expansion. These limitations are largely driven by a\nshortage of skilled professionals, limited accessibility to quantum\ninfrastructure, and the high complexity and cost associated with building and\noperating quantum hardware. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an\nopen-access software-based quantum network virtualization platform designed to\nfacilitate scalable and remote interaction with quantum hardware. The system is\nbuilt around a cloud application that virtualizes the core hardware components\nof a lab-scale quantum network testbed, including the time tagger and optical\nswitch, enabling users to perform coincidence counts of the photon\nentanglements while ensuring fair resource allocation. The fairness is ensured\nby employing the Hungarian Algorithm to allocate nearly equal effective\nentanglement rates among users.
