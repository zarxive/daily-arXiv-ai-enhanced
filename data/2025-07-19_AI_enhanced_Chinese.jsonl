Unlike unipolar responses, bipolar\nbehavior enables direct binary encoding and enhanced photodetection contrast.\nHowever, in conventional photoconductive or photovoltaic systems, the\nsimultaneous and opposite-directional transport of electrons and holes often\nsuppresses polarity switching. Recent self-powered Shockley-Ramo (SR)\nphotoresponse in gapless materials also show only unipolar signals due to\nstrong, irreversible electron-hole asymmetry. Here, we demonstrate for the\nfirst-time bipolar SR photoresponse in GaAs nanoconstriction devices by\nexploiting reversible electron-hole asymmetry. The longer carrier lifetimes in\nGaAs enable sub-diffusion-length control of carrier dynamics through geometry.\nBy tuning photocarrier dynamics near the nanoconstriction for both majority\nelectrons and minority holes, we modulate the SR response to exhibit dual\npolarities. At low excitation, photoelectrons dominate; as excitation\nincreases, intervalley scattering populates higher-energy L-valleys, reducing\nelectron contribution and leading to polarity reversal driven by the growing\ndominance of photoexcited holes. These results, supported by SR theory, show\nthat nanoscale geometric engineering, together with the reversible\nelectron-hole asymmetry, enables self-powered bipolar photocurrent responses,\noffering new routes toward advanced optoelectronic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u5728GaAs\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea6\u675f\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u6781\u6027SR\u5149\u7535\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u7167\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7535\u6d41\u6781\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u8c03\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u5148\u8fdb\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5149\u7535\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6781\u6027 toggle \u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5982\u5149\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u53cc\u5411\u8fd0\u8f93\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u6781\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u6781\u6027\u6781\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "method": "\u5728GaAs\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea6\u675f\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6750\u8d28\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53cc\u6781\u6027SR\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ef6\u957f\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50 lifetime\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7684\u6269\u6563\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u6781\u6027SR\u5149\u7535\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236SR\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6781\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8c03\u63a7\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u6781\u6027SR\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9700\u8981\u6781\u6027\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Employing a real-space formulation of the OAM\noperator within linear response theory, we demonstrate that in low-symmetry\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, such as 1$T{}_d$-MoTe2, the\ncurrent-induced itinerant OAM exceeds the spin response by three orders of\nmagnitude. When TMDs are coupled with ferromagnets with negligible intrinsic\norbital responses, the itinerant OAM generated by the orbital Rashba-Edelstein\neffect transfers across the interface, generating spin densities capable of\ninducing magnetization dynamics inside the ferromagnet. Our findings highlight\nthe previously overlooked role of itinerant OAM in the generation of\nout-of-plane spin densities, which serves as an emerging mechanism for\nefficient electrical control of magnetization in low-power, ultracompact\nstorage devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7 itinerary\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff08OAM\uff09\u5728\u5bcc\u52d2\u70ef\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a2a\u5411\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u6d41\u5f15\u53d1\u7684OAM\u8fdc\u8d85\u81ea\u65cb\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0e\u65e0\u5185\u5411\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u6750\u6599\u63a5\u58e4\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u754c\u9762\u4f20\u9012\u51fa\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u78c1\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86OAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7535\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u6750\u6599\u548c\u78c1\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u9ad8\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u3002],[-", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff08OAM\uff09\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684TMD\u5355\u5c42\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u6bd4\u59821Td-MoTe2\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f62\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u7535\u6d41\u5f15\u8d77\u7684OAM\u8d85\u51fa\u81ea\u65cb\u54cd\u5e94\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06TMD\u6750\u6599\u4e0e\u65e0\u5185\u5411OAM\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u6750\u6599\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Rashba-Edelstein \u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8f68\u9053 Rashba \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8de8\u5c42\u4f20\u9012\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u78c1\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u65cb\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u5fc3\u7684\u78c1\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027TMD\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u7535\u6d41\u5f15\u8d77\u7684OAM\u6bd4\u81ea\u65cb\u54cd\u5e94\u9ad8\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53\u4e0e\u65e0\u5185\u5411OAM\u7684\u94c1\u78c1\u6750\u6599coupled\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5728\u78c1\u5fc3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86itinerant OAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u5fc3\u7684\u78c1\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u5c55\u793a\u4e86OAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u7535\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u78c1\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Additionally, merging tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating can reduce discrepancies and potentially lower the required reheating temperature, which supports observations related to PBHs and early universe physics.", "conclusion": "The study concludes that fine-tuning Starobinsky inflation with e-folds, reheating temp, and a mixed preheating approach can enhance the model's consistency with recent observational data. This suggests the model could better explain phenomena like PBHs and offer implications for early universe physics and cosmology."}}

However, it comes at the cost of substantial logical-level overhead in\nboth space and time. In this work, we propose a very low-cost magic state\ndistillation scheme for biased-noise qubits. By leveraging the noise bias, our\nscheme enables the preparation of a magic state with a logical error rate of $3\n\\times 10^{-7}$, using only 53 qubits and 5.5 error correction rounds, under a\nnoise bias of $\\eta \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^6$ and a phase-flip noise rate of\n$0.1\\%$. This reduces the circuit volume by more than one order of magnitude\nrelative to magic state cultivation for unbiased-noise qubits and by more than\ntwo orders of magnitude relative to standard magic state distillation.\nMoreover, our scheme provides three key advantages over previous proposals for\nbiased-noise qubits. First, it only requires nearest-neighbor two-qubit gates\non a 2D lattice.

Traditionally,\ndesigns have favored high refractive index contrast to maximize the photonic\nband gap (PBG) size. Here, we demonstrate that low-index contrast systems offer\na powerful and underexplored route to achieving improved optical\nfunctionalities. In particular, we show that low index contrast enables more\nclosely aligned PBGs for transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM)\npolarizations, allowing for broadband superposition of TE and TM Bloch Surface\nWaves (BSWs). As a demonstration of this functionality, we use this approach to\ndesign 1DPCs capable of generating planar superchiral fields for enhanced\ncircular dichroism spectroscopy. To realize such structures, we use an\nautomated design framework based on multi-objective genetic optimization. By\ncomparing optimized designs in both high and low index contrast regimes, we\nfind that low index contrast systems yield significantly greater overlap\nbetween the TE and TM BSW dispersion relations and exhibit a pronounced\nreduction in optical anisotropy - both of which contribute to enhanced optical\nchirality across the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, simulations reveal\nthat these low index contrast structures offer improved robustness to\nfabrication tolerances and support a wider dynamic range of chiral analyte\nconcentrations. In addition to their optical performance advantages, low-index\ncontrast systems are naturally compatible with polymeric materials, which offer\nbenefits such as low cost, sustainability, and mechanical flexibility.

Crucially, the\nstrength of the instability, \\textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives\nneeded to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is\ngiven by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon\n$\\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor.

While most of the\nexperiments to compare the different iterative methods are performed with\nsimulated annealing solvers, we also confirm the practicality of our method\nwith experiments on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u589e\u4f53\u4f46\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u5f31\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u9000\u706b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u56e0\u8fde\u63a5\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\uff0c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u56fe\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u5206\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5f31\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u9000\u706b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u968f\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668D-Wave Advantage\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u589e\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

When the gapped\nsystems belong to a nontrivial higher Berry class, the associated conformal\nboundary conditions induce a flow of the ordinary Berry curvature, resulting in\na Chern number pump in the Fock space of the BCFT.

In this work, we present a unified comparative study of the\nthermopower in armchair nanoribbons derived from five archetypal 2D materials:\ngraphene, silicene, germanene, stanene and phosphorene. Using a tight binding\nmodel parametrized by first principles inputs and solved within the Landauer\nButtiker formalism, we compute strain and width dependent thermopower across\nnanoribbons classified by width families (3p, 3p+1, 3p+2) over a wide range of\nuniaxial tensile strain. Our results reveal that thermoelectric behavior is\ngoverned by a complex interplay of bandgap evolution, chemical potential\nasymmetry, and quantum confinement. While graphene and silicene exhibit\npronounced family and width sensitive thermopower enhancement under moderate\nstrain, heavier Xenes such as germanene and stanene show diminished responses.\nIn particular, phosphorene nanoribbons emerge as exceptional, exhibiting\nremarkably high thermopower (62 kB/e), a consequence of their large, persistent\nbandgap and anisotropic electronic structure. Across all systems, the 3p+2\nfamily transitions from near-metallic to semiconducting under strain, enabling\ndramatic activation of thermopower in previously inactive configurations. This\nsystematic cross material analysis delineates the design principles for the\noptimization of TE in 1D nanoribbons, highlighting the strategic use of width\ncontrol and strain engineering.

We show that these systems cannot\nmediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are\nthemselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras\n(as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product.\nThis result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced\nentanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently\nnon-classical features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aC*-\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f15\u529b\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1f\u8fd9\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aC*-\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f15\u53d1\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u8d77\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Despite the on-shell freeness, the spin operators\nare still far away from being Gaussian, and create particles in the asymptotic\nstates with complicated correlations. We show how the number observables can\nstill be incorporated into the integrable Sinh-Gordon/Painleve-III framework\nand controlled by linear differential equations with two variables $(r,Y)$. We\nshow how the differential equations and the information of two crucial scaling\nfunctions arising in the $r\\rightarrow 0$, $e^{Y}r={\\cal O}(1)$ scaling limit,\ncan be combined to fully determine the small-$r$ asymptotics of the\nobservables, in the $\\lambda$-extended form.

This enables us to encode the mechanical qubit\nwithin the ground and first excited squeezed Fock states of the driven\nmechanical oscillator. This kind of mechanical qubit is termed mechanical\nsqueezed-Fock qubit. We also show that our mechanical qubit can serve as a\nquantum sensor for weak forces, with its resulting sensitivity increased by at\nleast one order of magnitude over that of traditional mechanical qubits.

The quantum circuits are explicit and straightforward, and\nare arguably simpler than those previously reported.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684Dicke\u6001\uff1aSU(2)\u65cb\u91cfDicke\u6001\u548cSU(d)Dicke\u6001\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u751f\u6210\u8fd9\u4e9b\u591a\u805a\u6001\u3002", "motivation": " explored the extension of Dicke states, fundamental in quantum computing, into higher dimensions and provided novel generation methods for these states, which is important for quantum information processing and quantum computing applications\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684Dicke\u6001\u3002\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86SU(2)\u65cb\u91cfDickie\u6001\u548cSU(d)\u591a\u805a\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6240\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684Dickie\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u201d,"}}

Previously, a single-qubit quantum memory with a\ncoherence time of about an hour has been realized in a dual-species setup where\na coolant ion provides sympathetic cooling for a memory ion of different\nspecies. However, the frequent random position hopping between the ions in the\nroom-temperature trap limits the technique there only applicable to\nsingle-qubit storage. Here we report a multi-ion quantum memory in a cryogenic\ntrap based on the dual-type scheme, and demonstrate a coherence time above two\nhours for a logical qubit encoded in the decoherence-free subspace, i.e.\ntwo-ion entangled states, after correcting the dominant leakage error. Our\nscheme alleviates the necessity of an ultra-stable frequency reference for the\nstored qubit, and has a preferable scalability owing to the same mass of the\nmetastable-state memory ions and the ground-state coolant ion.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
