Leading textbooks\nand research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them\ndue to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a\nsolution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels\noriginating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in\nweighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this\nidea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a\nlong-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree,\nFock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase\ndiagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative\ncorrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase\nfor weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in\naddition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle\nphysics."}

Accurately modeling the\nconformations of IDPs in solution poses a challenge to traditional force fields\nthat are tuned to predict the properties of folded proteins. There is a need\nfor generalized atomistic force fields that can accurately predict the\nproperties of both folded proteins and IDPs. Improvements to protein force\nfields for increased accuracy in secondary structure prediction and new water\nmodels with increased water-water dispersion interactions have been proposed in\nsearch of a generalized simulation method. Validating the proposed improvements\nagainst experiments poses challenges such as a lack of suitable systems to test\nthe generalizability and choosing a property of interest to match the\nsimulation results against experiments.

The specific improvements due to the AMBER ff19SB protein force field\nand the OPC water model are isolated and studied.

While scanning\nprobe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of\nsurface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in\nmulti-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures,\nstates that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal\ndetected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and\ninterpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a\nglimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts\nthe charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW\nheterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform\nlayer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in\ndouble-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here\nthe discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of\nmicrowaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases\nin the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane\noffers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative\nquantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we\nextract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap\nsizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes\nbeneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and\nscreening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that\nthe uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a\nwide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from\nfractional Chern insulators in Moir\\'e superlattices to correlated states in\nmultilayer graphene."}

In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists\nin isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not\nproceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates\nof even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\\sim T^2$\nlow-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with\nodd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of\ninteractions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity\nrelaxation rates as large as $40\\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong\nadditional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even\nstaggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle\nscattering.

Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field\nfractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized\nanomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign\nof the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic\npolarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the\nCI/FCI states.

At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand\npreparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e.,\nelectrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable\nferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping.

For two particles at relative rest, we derive this\nresult as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start\nby assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting\nparticles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a\nhypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time\ncoordinates and their rest masses.

The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2\nsymmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and\nk-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a\nDinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the\napproach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a\nD-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii)\nfinite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends;\n(iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED)\non small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show\nED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster\ntracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study\nquantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error\nreduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising\nbenchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and\nNeal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates\nportability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for\nmapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity,\nresources, and embedding."}

We find a\nsolution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels\noriginating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in\nweighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this\nidea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a\nlong-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree,\nFock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase\ndiagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative\ncorrections.
