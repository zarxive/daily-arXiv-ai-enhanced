We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6Planckian\u6563\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u4e0a\u9650\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u70ed\u52a0\u6743\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4e0a\u9650\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u4e86Planckian\u6781\u9650\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6307\u5411\u5171\u4ef7\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91d1\u5c5e\u7b49\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684Planckian\u6563\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c condensed matter physics\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u7684Drude\u548c\u975eDrude\u5149\u5bfc\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e10\u8fd1\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u627e\u5230\u5149\u8c31\u77e9\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u4e0a\u9650\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u4e0a\u9650\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u9650\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660ePlanckian\u6563\u5c04\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u5171\u4ef7\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6Planckian\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u6d01\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Planckian\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5171\u4ef7\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u70ed\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u4fe1\u4f7f\u4f20\u9012\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Kuptsov"], "title": "An improved approach for estimating the dimension of inertial manifolds in chaotic distributed dynamical systems via analysis of angles between tangent subspaces", "comment": "11 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "While a previously proposed method for estimating inertial manifold dimension, based on explicitly computing angles between pairs of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), employs efficient algorithms, it remains computationally demanding due to its substantial resource requirements. In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators.

In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics.

These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $\u03bc$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $\u03bc^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $\u03bc$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \\textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect.

However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset.

Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, realizing these phases has so far required complex protocols, such as drives with multiple incommensurate frequencies. Here, we present a significantly simpler mechanism: the emergence of DQTCs in a dissipative collective spin system subjected to only a single periodic drive. Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive.

Atomistic simulations indicate that such ordering leads to an electric potential difference $\u03c7$, the surface potential, of about $-0.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$ across the first few molecular layers. Here, we calculate surface potentials at interfaces between a simple model fluids and a solid, with Molecular Dynamics simulations. The fluids are made up of either diatomic, dipolar molecules or a single Lennard-Jones particle with a dipole moment. All fluids show some structuring near the interface, but charge oscillations and a non-zero surface potential are present only for asymmetric molecules (unequal diameters of the atoms) or molecules with an off-center dipole. We condense this finding into the criterion that the geometric and dipolar centers of a molecule must differ for the fluid to exhibit a surface potential. Remarkably, while the solid--fluid interaction strength strongly affects the magnitude of charge oscillations, it hardly affects the potential drop $\u03c7$.

In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth.

This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states.

XAS results were compared with density functional theory computations of the spectra, allowing an identification of main features and an assessment of the theoretical approximations. Our RIXS measurements reveal that AgF2 exhibits charge transfer excitations and dd excitations, analogous to those observed in La2CuO4. We propose to use the ratio of dd to CT spectral weight as a measure of the covalence of the compounds and provide explicit equations for the weights as a function of the scattering geometry for crystals and powders. The measurements at the metal site L3 edge and previous measurements at the ligand K edge reveal a striking similarity between the fluorides and cuprates materials, with fluorides somewhat more covalent than cuprates. These findings support the hypothesis that silver fluorides are an excellent platform to mimic the physics of cuprates, providing a promising avenue for exploring high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional (AgF2) and quasi-one-dimensional (AgFBF4) materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Silver fluorides and cuprates share similar electronic properties, making AgF\u2082 a good model for studying cuprates in high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism.", "motivation": "Understanding high-Tc superconductivity and cuprates is crucial for advancing materials science.", "method": "X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at Ag L3 edge; density functional theory computations.", "result": "AgF\u2082 shows charge transfer and dd excitations; RIXS measurements pinpoint how covalence affects electronic structure; AgF\u2082 is more covalent than cuprates.", "conclusion": "Silver fluorides can mimic cuprates, aiding exploration of high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in 2D and 1D materials."}}

These motifs can exhibit features that reveal how individual objects interact with one another. Simultaneously, the motifs can also interact, causing new coarse-grained properties to emerge in the system.\n  In this paper, we found motifs in a simulated system of Dynamically Self-Organising cells. We also found that quantifying these motifs with a set of physically interpretable structural and dynamic features efficiently captures the interaction dynamics of the motifs' underlying cells. Using these motif features, we revealed packing strain and defects in large compact aggregates, semi-periodicity in motif ensembles, and phase space classes with unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, we trained neural networks to infer the critical hidden microscopic interaction parameters within each motif from coarse-grained motif features extracted from snapshots of the system. Furthermore, we uncovered emergent features that can predict the movement of cell collectives by hierarchically coarse-graining smaller motifs into larger ones (e.g. motif clusters). We speculate that this concept of motif hierarchies may be applied broadly to many-body interacting systems that are otherwise too complex to understand.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Several variants of the original dynamical system, including the presence of gravity and friction, are considered, in order to analyze whether the integrable cases are preserved or not in presence of further external forces, both potential and non-potential. Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49Ziegler\u53cc\u6446\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u548c\u4ece\u6709\u5e8f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u6469\u64e6\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u989d\u5916\u5916\u529b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u8017\u6563\u529b\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8be5\u6620\u5c04\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408Devaney\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4fdd\u5b88\u4e0e\u8017\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u5916\u529b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u8ba4\u8bc6\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5e7f\u4e49Ziegler\u53cc\u6446\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5916\u529b\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5206\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49Ziegler\u53cc\u6446\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u539f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u5916\u529b\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9Ziegler\u53cc\u6446\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5916\u529b\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Here, we present machine learning (ML) models that correct the INDO/s results with negligible increases in the amount of computing resources needed. While INDO/s excitations energies have an average error of about 1.1 eV relative to TDDFT energies, the added ML corrections reduce the error to 0.2 eV.

Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear.

However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter \"spike\" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or \"mound\". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited.", "AI": {"tldr": "The Hall-resistivity anomalies in a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet are not due to chiral spin textures but caused by multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.", "motivation": "To resolve the controversy surrounding the origin of Hall-resistivity anomalies in magnetic materials.", "method": "Transport measurements, including Hall resistivity, and transmission electron microscopy analysis were conducted on the Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet.", "result": "The Hall resistivity anomalies observed in transport measurements are attributed to sample inhomogeneity and the presence of multiple anomalous Hall channels rather than chiral spin textures.", "conclusion": "This study conclusively demonstrates that the observed Hall effect is not evidence of chiral spin textures but instead arises from trivial material inhomogeneity, highlighting the challenges in identifying such textures through transport measurements."}}

To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability.

These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "This thesis explores how discrete structures like graphs and hypergraphs assess quantumness in quantum theory.", "motivation": "The thesis focuses on quantum information and computation, highlighting the role of discrete structures in understanding quantumness.", "method": "The author presents work in three categories: contextuality with graphs/hypergraphs, causality with directed graphs, and measurement incompatibility with hypergraphs.", "result": "Various contributions include Kochen-Specker contextuality, generalized contextuality, causal models, and incompatibility studies.", "conclusion": "Future work is suggested to address broader quantum phenomena not yet covered."}}

Here, we demonstrate the direct growth of high-quality InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting in the telecom O-band using a strain-reducing layer approach on silicon. Deterministic integration of individual QDs into circular Bragg grating resonators is achieved via in-situ electron-beam lithography. The resulting devices exhibit strong out-coupling enhancement, with photon extraction efficiencies up to $(40 \\pm 2)\\%$, in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.

Spins existing widely in biological systems, offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers.

We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations. Viewing the early universe as a \"high complexity, low magic\" regime provides another perspective of what it means for the origin of structure in the universe to be \"quantum.\"", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures.

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We extend the construction to fields with spin 1 and 2, and find that massless spin fields map to spin fields with continuous mass spectra. In this construction, we identify the de Sitter counterparts of the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the asymptotic symmetries in Minkowski spacetime.

Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion.

We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter.

In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u5173\u95ed\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u6da8\u843d\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u7c7b\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6da8\u843d\u7ed9\u51fa\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5747\u503c\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6da8\u843d\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4f7f\u7528\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u548cDyson\u7ea7\u6570\u5904\u7406\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u6f14\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u5f00\u8003\u8651\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e0a\u754c\u53d8\u677e\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u52a8\u6001 Router \u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u6da8\u843d\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u548cDyson\u7ea7\u6570\u5904\u7406\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5143\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6da8\u843d\u589e\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u4ec5\u5173\u95ed\u7cfb\u7edf\u627e\u5230\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5f00\u8003\u8651\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4f7f\u4e0a\u754c\u53d8\u677e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u5f00\u8003\u8651\u4f1a\u4f7f\u4e0a\u754c\u53d8\u677e\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Here, we introduce a versatile time delayed DPRC framework that natively supports deep and concurrent spatiotemporal processing entirely in the optical domain. At its core, the system leverages free carrier dynamics in silicon microring resonators to provide the fundamental nonlinearity and short term memory, and these nonlinear nodes are interconnected through true time delay lines that establish shared long-term memory. Benefiting from intrinsic physical nonlinearity and multi-timescale fading memory, this simple yet effective architecture demonstrates remarkable high dimensional representation capabilities. On the NTU RGB D benchmark, the parameter efficient DPRC system achieves superior action recognition accuracies compared to mainstream deep learning models, while requiring only a single shot regression training procedure. We further verify a prototype DPRC chip that excels across diverse dataset classification and time series prediction tasks. It enables a streamlined all optical pipeline between hierarchical layers, delivering a consistent computational density of 334.25 TOPs/mm2, independent of the reservoir depth and three orders of magnitude higher than conventional approaches. Moreover, its performance scales with near-zero hardware overhead by utilizing additional wavelength channels.

Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect.

In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators.

Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it.

However, the most scalable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) based implementations have so far been limited to a few qubits. Here, to take a step towards large scale systems, we tune and coherently control an eight-dot linear array of silicon spin qubits fabricated in 300 mm CMOS-compatible foundry process, establishing operational scalability beyond the two-qubit regime. All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $\u03bc$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array. Additionally, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate operation between adjacent qubits with low phase noise. We demonstrate here that we can scale silicon spin qubit arrays to medium-sized arrays of 8 qubits while maintaining coherence of the system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6210\u529f\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u4e86\u516b\u6761\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u7845 spins \u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6b65\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u7845\u8f6c\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684 promising\u5019\u9009\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u5236\u9020\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u4f46\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e 300 mm CMOS \u76f8\u5bb9\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\uff08CMOS\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecd\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684CMOS\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7845\u8f6c\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8fd9\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8c03\u5236\u5e76\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u7531 300 mm CMOS \u76f8\u5bb9\u751f\u4ea7\u6d41\u7a0b\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u516b\u6761\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u7845\u8f6c\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u9000\u8c10\u632f\u6cd5\uff08Cryogenic\uff09\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8c03\u5236\u4e86\u516b\u6761\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ea7\u7535\u8377\u68c0\u6d4b\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6c\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u8f6c\u5b50\u95e8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u4f4d\u566a\u58f0\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7845\u8f6c\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u6269\u5c55\u5230 8 \u6761\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6253\u4e0b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236 8 \u6761\u7ebf\u6027\u7845\u8f6c\u5b50\u9635\u5217\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8f6c\u5b50\u95e8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e 300 mm CMOS \u7684\u4e92\u8865\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u9635\u5217\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u7ee7\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u8f6c\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e43\u81f3\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u90fd\u6709\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs. Furthermore, we demonstrate by numerical analysis that the IVC order significantly enhances valley-current generation in rhombohedral graphene. These results open a pathway toward exploring exotic phenomena emerging from valley-gauge-symmetry breaking, in close analogy with gauge-symmetry breaking in superconductors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u7ae0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4ecb\u89c2\u76f8\u53d8\u4f53\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u53cd\u53d7\u529b\u58f0\u6ce2\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5e76\u5b9a\u91cf\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cd\u53d7\u529b\u58f0\u6ce2\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u901f\u7387\u3002\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u89d2leanor\u5f62\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ecb\u89c2\u76f8\u53d8\u4f53\u6001\u663e\u8457\u5f3a\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4ecb\u89c2\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65f6\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ecb\u89c2\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65f6\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u51c6\u6676\u5e8f\u7684\u4ecb\u89c2\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u5b58\u5728\u5728\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u89d2\u6295\u8d44\u57fa\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u53cd\u53d7\u529b\u58f0\u6ce2\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u6d41\u4e0e\u6ce2\u957f\u3001\u9891\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5b9a\u91cf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u5bf9\u7535\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7403\u8c10\u6ce2\u53cd\u53d7\u529b\u58f0\u6ce2\u4e0b\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u7834\u574f\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u6d41\u5f3a\u5ea6\u968f\u7740\u58f0\u6ce2\u9891\u7387\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u5e42\u5f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u6709\u7740\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u6295\u8d44\u57fa\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u89d2\u6295\u8d44\u57fa\u91d1\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548ctrinsic Prandtl\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u5728\u53cd\u53d7\u529b\u58f0\u6ce2\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u89d2\u6295\u8d44\u57fa\u91d1\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4ecb\u89c2\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5170\u5179itation\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u57c3\u4f26\u8d39\u65af\u7279\u5b9a\u7406\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u58f0\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u5728\u5c0f\u503c\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u96f6\u81ea\u65cb\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u632f\u8361\u5668\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u65e0\u5e8f\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u96f6\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u5b50\u5230\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f3a\u65e0\u5e8f\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ecf\u5178\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u4e5f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86delocalization\uff0c\u8fd9\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5170\u5179itation\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u8f68\u8ff9\u57c3\u4f26\u8d39\u65af\u7279\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u58f0\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c0f\u58f0\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u632f\u8361\u5668\u94fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5dee\u5206\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u968f\u7740\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u53bb\u6709\u5e8f\u6563\u5c04\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7684\u7834\u574f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Using the Matsubara formalism and imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a massless $\u03ba$-scalar field, we compute the $\u03ba$-deformed corrections to thermal Casimir free energy, pressure, entropy, and internal energy. Our results demonstrate that space-time non-commutativity enhances the attractive nature of the thermal Casimir force while preserving thermodynamic consistency; the system satisfies the Nernst theorem and laws of thermodynamics remain intact in $\u03ba$-deformed space-time.

To mitigate these challenges, we explore novel protocols that enable simultaneous classical and quantum communications, relying on a single set of transceivers to jointly modulate and decode classical and quantum information onto the same signal.

While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability.

We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade.

The rotation occurs when the distance from the charge to the center of the sphere is changed. This phenomenon occurs due to induced static fields and is a consequence of the axion electrodynamics underlying the electromagnetic response of a topological insulator. Assuming a regime where the charged probe can be regarded as a point charge $q=Ne$, where $N$ is a positive integer and $e$ is the elementary electric charge, we obtain that the rotation frequency is given by $\u03c9=(N\u03b1)^2\u03a5(\u03b5,d/a)/I$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia, $\u03b1$ is the fine-structure constant, and the function $\u03a5$ depends on the dielectric constant $\u03b5$ and the relative distance $d/a$ of the charge from the center of the sphere of radius $a$. Since the point charge also induces Hall currents on the surface, we compute also their associated angular momentum. This allows us to derive an exact expression for the electronic velocity on the surface as a function of $a/d$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9760\u8fd1\u7403\u5f62\u65e0\u5b9a\u5219\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u5c0f\u5e26\u7535\u63a2\u9488\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5176\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u5176\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d7\u7403\u5fc3\u548c\u7535\u8377\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u673a\u5236\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e0\u5b9a\u5219\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5e26\u7535\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u5b9a\u5219\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u65cb\u8f6c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65e0\u5b9a\u5219\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7535\u63a2\u9488\u5bf9\u7403\u5f62\u65e0\u5b9a\u5219\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7axion\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u9762Hall\u7535\u6d41\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u7535\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e26\u7535\u63a2\u9488\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u9891\u7387\u516c\u5f0f\u03c9=(N\u03b1)^2\u03a5(\u03b5,d/a)/I\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u8868\u9762Hall\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u9762\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7403\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u7535\u8377\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u5b9a\u5219\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u78c1\u5316\u7535\u8377\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u5e26\u7535\u7269\u6781\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4ea7\u751f\u8868\u9762\u78c1\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b8f\u4f1f\u4e14\u793a\u4f8b\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002"}}

The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data.

For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs).

The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision. However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The spacer provides an additional ferromagnetic contribution that renormalizes the otherwise temperature-independent interlayer coupling. As a result, the system shows antiferromagnetic alignment at high temperatures and ferromagnetic alignment at low temperatures. This behavior is observed in Fe(2 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$(0.9 nm)/Cr(0.4 nm)/Fe(2 nm) multilayers with the inner spacer Fe$_{17.5}$Cr$_{82.5}$ paramagnetic at and above room temperature, and is shown to be due to the spacer being significantly magnetically polarized on lowering the temperature toward its Curie point.

Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians.

The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be6\u7ec6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5c06\u7eaf\u6001\u73bb\u8272\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73bb\u8272\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u548c condensed matter \u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u7531\u4e8e hafnian \u7684\u9650\u5236\u5341\u5206\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u521b\u5efa\u7b97\u5b50\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5c40\u90e8 MPS \u5f20\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8ba1\u7b97 hafnian \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7 Jiuzhang 2.0 \u548c Jiuzhang 4.0 \u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u524d\u6709 tensor \u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u7684\u73bb\u8272\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86 MPS \u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}} d_{\\mathrm{out}} k/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u4f18channel uses\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f97\u51faO(d\u2074/\u03b5\u00b2)\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u6700\u591alog\u56e0\u5b50\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u6570\u4ee5\u53caKraus\u79e9\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4eceunitary\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08POVMs\uff09\u548cisometries\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u8303\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u79e9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8ff9\u8ddd\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u786e\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u4f73channel uses\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6240\u8ff0\u4fe1\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u65e0 noisy\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4ee5\u51c6\u5907Choi\u72b6\u6001\u526f\u672c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e00\u8d77\u7eaf\u5316\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a purification\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u6700\u4f18\u7eaf\u6001 tomography\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Diamond\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u534a\u6b63\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u5206\u6790\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1d\u7ef4\u4fe1\u9053\u5728Diamond\u8ddd\u79bb\u6240\u9700\u7684channel uses\u6570\u91cf\u81f3\u5c11\u4e3aO(d\u2074/\u03b5\u00b2)\uff0c\u8be5\u4e0a\u754c\u5728\u6700\u591alog\u56e0\u5b50\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u9650\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u6570\u4ee5\u53caKraus\u79e9\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4eceunitary\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08POVMs\uff09\u548cisometries\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u8303\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u79e9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8ff9\u8ddd\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u786e\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u4f73channel uses\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6240\u8ff0\u4fe1\u9053\u8ddd\u79bb\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u9650\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4eceunitary\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u901a\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7ef4\u6570\u4ee5\u53caKraus\u79e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

However, theoretical bulk calculations and a recent experiment show that the edge states persist in the presence of large external magnetic fields. To address this apparent contradiction, we have developed an analytical description for the edge-state wave function of a semi-infinite sample in a perpendicular magnetic field. Our description relies on the usual bulk Landau levels, together with additional states arising due to the presence of the hard wall, which are unnormalizable in the infinite system. The analytical wave functions agree extremely well with numerical calculations and can be used to directly analyze the behavior of the edge states in a magnetic field.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5229\u7528\u51efanto-\u8428\u8d6b\u65af\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5947\u5c14\u5fb7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5916\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fbe\u5e03\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8 maternity\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u51efanto-\u8428\u8d6b\u65af\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5947\u5c14\u5fb7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5916\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fbe\u5e03\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fbe\u5e03\u53d8\u6362\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5185\u5916\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8 maternity\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u8fbe\u5e03\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u52a9\u52a8\u5668\u53d8\u6362\u7528\u4f5c\u8054\u7cfb\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8 maternity\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so.

Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances.

We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\\Im (\u03c9,\\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(\u03c9,\\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $\u03c9\\cdot \\Im G(\u03c9,\\vec k) \\ge 0$ for real $(\u03c9,\\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\\Im [\u03c9\\, G(\u03c9,\\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $\u03b5(\u03c9,k)$ and $\u03bc^{-1}(\u03c9,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium.

Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons.

The numerical analysis demonstrates that the renormalized tensor behaves smoothly with respect to the parameters of the system and exhibits physically consistent limits in both the strong-field and infrared regimes. The induced energy density grows with the field strength and follows a quadratic behavior, which is consistent with the Schwinger mechanism in three dimension.

We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge.

Early Universe inflation and subsequent reheating could be a unique setup for testing potentially observable effects coming from the derivative expansion of the corresponding EFT around the flat space vacuum. In this work, we consider an EFT describing perturbative reheating dominated by the decay of inflaton to photons caused by the dimension-5 operator $\u03c6F_{\u03bc\u03bd} F^{\u03bc\u03bd}$. We compute the graviton production during reheating and high frequency gravitational wave signal due to the bremsstrahlung effect in the presence of $R_{\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1}F^{\u03bc\u03bd} F^{\u03bb\u03c1}$ operator.

However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ans\u00e4tze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea0\u6b63\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u73af\u5f62\u7801\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u503c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684Error Correction\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u624b\u6bb5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86QEC\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5f62\u7801\u4e0eIsing\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u503c\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e3aQEC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea0\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.\n  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states. In particular, we show that for strong coupling the protocol yields almost complete population transfer between the two outer states, with only small transient population of the middle state, while retaining the same intrinsic robustness as in the underlying two-level model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5065\u7684 populace

Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a quantum computing approach for analyzing electromagnetic waveguide modes using the VQE method.

We completely address DSEU by showing that, for $n$-qubit unitary channels, the query complexity of DSEU is $\u0398(\\sqrt{d})$, where $d=2^n$, for both incoherent and coherent accesses. First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\\sqrt{d})$. Although incoherent access is generally weaker than coherent access, our incoherent algorithm matches this complexity by leveraging additional shared randomness between devices, highlighting the power of shared randomness in distributed quantum learning.

First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling.

We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA.

Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
