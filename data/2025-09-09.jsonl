Below its Curie\ntemperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate\nwithin the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1].\nBy applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with\nlow-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry\nscale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These\ndomains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon\ncurrent reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing\nvoltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without\nsuperconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in\norbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts."}

We searched for\na theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic\nfields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the\nfield region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a\nnonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of\ndifferent magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase\nregion does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does.\nWe tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat\nmeasurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the\ntwo-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking\nof magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic\nspin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that\noccur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements.

Our results reveal that\nvortex photons exhibit exceptional sensitivity to the magnetic moments of\nRydberg atoms, positioning them as a powerful spectroscopic tool for\ninvestigating Rydberg magnetism. It is also demonstrated that the initial\nphoton energy must be carefully selected to observe significant experimental\nresults. Furthermore, the photoionization process displays strong angular\nmomentum selectivity, preferentially favoring configurations where the photon\ntotal angular momentum and atomic magnetic moment are aligned. This pronounced\nasymmetry directly manifests the chiral nature of the vortex photon-Rydberg\natom interaction."}

Motivated by the anomalous three-body\ndecay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work\ninvestigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The\nthree-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic\nrepresentation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is\nobtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate\ncoefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength\nwhere the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the\nthreshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally\naveraged $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the\nexperiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ also\nexplicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi\nenergies $E_{F}^{(i)}\\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy\nis reduced, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and\nbecomes a function of temperature only.

Therefore, a\nsignificant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped\nensemble as kinetic energy.

This extends our\nprevious single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to\ntwo-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene,\nwhere insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall\neffect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional\nsequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization,\nwe generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and\nhigh mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE.\nFor 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an\neffective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large\neffective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the\ncalculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical\nexpressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall\nconductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical\npredictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states.\nSimulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations\nunder realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D\nsemimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron\nLandau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This\nprovides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions,\nhighlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The\nmodel further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport\nproperties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions."}

However, both the risk\nof training-data membership leakage remains underexplored in QML. This\nmotivates us to propose Quantum Machine Unlearning (QMU) to explore two core\nquestions: do QML models require MU due to training-data membership leakage,\nand can MU mechanisms be efficiently implemented in the QML? To answer the two\nquestions, we conducted experiments on the MNIST classification task, utilizing\na class-wise unlearning paradigm in both noiseless simulations and quantum\nhardware. First, we quantify training-data privacy leakage using a Membership\nInference Attack (MIA), observing average success rates of 90.2\\% in noiseless\nsimulations and 75.3\\% on quantum hardware. These results indicate that QML\nmodels present training-data membership leakage with very high probability\nunder adversarial access, motivating the need for MU. Second, we implement MU\nalgorithms on the QML model, which reduces the average MIA success rate to 0\\%\nin simulations and 3.7\\% on quantum hardware while preserving accuracy on\nretained data.

In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a\nplatform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion\nlike particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for\nelectron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic\nfield and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress\ncharge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the\ncharge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and\nnoise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass\nranges. Our preliminary study holds promise for enhancing the screening of\nvarious axion signals using quantum technologies. We expect that our analysis\nand filtering protocol can help advance the use of semiconductor quantum dot\nspin qubit arrays in axion detection."}

Our results reveal that QME emerges\nprominently in the clean-interacting regime, where many-body correlations drive\nnonlinear relaxation pathways, enabling initially distant states to overtake\ncloser ones. In contrast, non-interacting systems exhibit conventional\nthermalization, whereas Stark potentials and random disorder suppress QME by\ninducing localization barriers, with disorder causing milder delays compared to\nthe pronounced effects of Stark fields. Entanglement asymmetry proves to be\nparticularly sensitive to the symmetry restoration dynamics underlying QME.\nThese findings elucidate the critical role of interactions in anomalous\nrelaxation and provide insights for controlling quantum thermalization in\nexperimental platforms such as ultra-cold atomic systems."}
