The confined cellular aggregates transitioned from\ncompressed spheres into dynamic living capillary bridges exhibiting bridge\nthinning and a convex-to-concave meniscus curvature transition. We found that\nthe stability of the bridge is determined by the interplay between cell growth\nand cell spreading on the confining surfaces. This interaction leads to bridge\nrupture at a critical length scale determined by the distance between the\nplates. The force distributions, formation and stability regimes of the living\ncapillary bridges were characterized with full 3D computer simulations that\nincluded cell division, migration and growth dynamics, directly showing how\nmechanical principles govern the behavior of the living bridges; cellular\naggregates display jamming and stiffening analogously to granular matter, and\ncell division along the long axis enhances thinning. Based on our results, we\npropose a new class of active soft matter behavior, where cellular aggregates\nexhibit liquid-like adaptation to confinement, but with self-organized\nrupturing driven by biological activity."}

Over the last two decades, terahertz (THz) technology has\nemerged as a new optical tool for microbiology.

This is a unified\nframework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry\ncurvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate\nrepresentation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method\nincorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic\nintersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy)\nindependent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter\n(e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with\ntheoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to\ngeometric phase effects.

This work addresses\nthese limitations by presenting a rigorous electromagnetic framework for PMC\nmetasurfaces based on dipolar and quadrupolar surface susceptibilities within\nthe generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) formalism. We show that\nachieving polarization- and angle-independent PMC behavior requires a specific\nset of heteroanisotropic (nonlocal) susceptibilities, and we derive closed-form\nexpressions for angular scattering that include higher-order multipole\ncontributions.

In most systems where\nstability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are\nconsidered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent\nperturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal\nphenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove\nthat it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the\nevolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the\ninstantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds\nremain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This\nflexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in\nproving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration\nspaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space\ncan induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break\nergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several\nsystems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving\nstate is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time\neven under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability\nof LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local.

One parameter determines the total\nnumber of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the\neffective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can\nbe either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the\nintrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux\nprofile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are\nstudied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and\nalign well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing\nJackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices\nare formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from\nclarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have\nappeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the\nmany-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel\nsupersymmetry-breaking phenomenon."}

For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry,\nKrylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with\nconventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a\ncomplementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and\ndynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the\nrecently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust\nand reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases\nwhere the total complexity fails to do so."}

This becomes particularly significant when considering operation in\ndynamic conditions such as those encountered in Earth orbiting satellites in\nthe perspective of future space gravity missions on-boarding a cold atom\naccelerometer. We study in this context the impact of rotation on the phase\nshift and contrast of an atom interferometer and investigate mitigation\nstrategies. An analytical model is derived and compared to experimental\ndemonstrations carried out using an original setup in which the well-controlled\nproof-mass of a space electrostatic accelerometer is used as the\nretro-reflection mirror of a cold atom gravimeter. By properly counter-rotating\nthe electrostatic proof-mass, we demonstrate for instance the possibility of\nrecovering the interferometer contrast, otherwise equal to zero, to a level\nbetter than 90%, in both cases of constant angular velocities or in presence of\nangular accelerations. Our results demonstrate the possibility to perform high\nperformance inertial measurements with a cold atom interferometer in a\nchallenging environments."}

On the other hand,\nthe Boltzmann operator $e^{-\\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$\nrepresenting the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature,\nrespectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of\nquantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the\nmatrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $\n\\langle \\tilde{x} | e^{-\\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \\rangle$, or the imaginary-time\npropagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\\rightarrow$\nimaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator.\nHowever, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence\nin the high-temperature limit $(T \\rightarrow \\infty)$. In this work, we solve\nthis problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $\\langle\n\\tilde{x} | e^{-\\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \\rangle$, specifically for systems where\nthe gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite\nupper bound. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the\npositions $x$ and $\\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic\nproblems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators,\nand its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical\nexamples."}

In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to\nunderstand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing\non the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional\nquantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent\nphotons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte\nCarlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which\nis further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show\nthat the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal\ncharacteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the\nglobal phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the\nferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as\ntwo distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI\nshows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the\nclassical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss\nour results, especially for the $\\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing\nexperimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results\ndemonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also\nbe viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of\nquantum magnets."}
