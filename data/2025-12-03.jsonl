One possible explanation provides the RNA world hypothesis. It states that life could emerge from RNA strands only, storing and transferring biological information, as well as catalyzing reactions as ribozymes. Before this state could have emerged, however, the prebiotic world was probably a purely chemical pool of short RNA strands with random sequences and without biological function performing hybridization and dehybridization, as well as ligation and cleavage. In this context relevant questions are what are the conditions that allow longer RNA strands to be built and how can information carrying in RNA sequence emerge?\n  In order to investigate such RNA reactors, efficient simulations are needed because the space of possible RNA sequences increases exponentially with the length of the strands, as well as the number of reactions between two strands. In addition, simulations have to be compared to experimental data for validation and parameter calibration. Here, we present the MoRSAIK python package for sequence motif (or k-mer) reactor simulation, analysis and inference. It enables users to simulate RNA sequence motif dynamics in the mean field approximation as well as to infer the reaction parameters from data with Bayesian methods and to analyze results by computing observables and plotting. MoRSAIK simulates an RNA reactor by following the reactions and the concentrations of all strands inside up to a certain length (of four nucleotides by default). Longer strands are followed indirectly, by tracking the concentrations of their containing sequence motifs of that maximum length."}

Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space. From this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates a conserved quantity, I. We identify this conserved quantity as the physical embodiment of host immunity, a measurable quantity that encapsulates the system's protective capacity, encompassing both its breadth and intensity. This prediction is testable through statistically indistinguishable responses to antigen pairs related by the symmetry transformation. Furthermore, This theoretical model provides a unified framework for understanding key immunological phenomena, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The conserved quantity I comprises a component quantifying protective breadth (with the dimension of action) and a component governing response intensity (with the dimension of energy), is thus established as a fundamental physical entity. This work transforms immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable entity, thereby establishing a foundational framework for predictive immunology and immunological intervention."}

We find that geometries giving rise to baby universes are always subdominant. It follows that the baby universe does not provide a semi-classical description of the state since it is encoded in an exponentially suppressed part of the wave function. We then apply a prescription developed in \\cite{Belin:2025wju} to make the baby universe geometry the leading saddle. In the process, the CFT state becomes mixed, in agreement with the qualitative gravitational picture. We show that the fluctuations in the baby universe are small, even at fixed central charge, making the geometry reliable in the semi-classical limit. Finally, we discuss the interpretation of this mixed state in pure gravity from the perspective of the Virasoro TQFT."}

Under optimal detuning, EIT achieved up to an order-of-magnitude enhancement in gradient sensitivity and maintained a twofold advantage even under identical detuning. Both approaches reached sub-diffraction spatial resolution in the range of 0.29lambda-0.40lambda, with EIT exhibiting sharper edge contrast and higher localization accuracy. These results confirm EIT as a fundamentally superior approach for precision atomic gradient sensing and sub-wavelength localization, offering clear guidance for the design of next-generation optical and quantum metrology systems."}

Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry."}

Our formulation further reveals that the EP frequency, given by the averaged value of the resonant modes, emerges as the physically relevant observable in the near-EP regime, and offers a robust foundation for modeling and extracting resonant ringdown signals."}

This corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 1.9, approaching the theoretical limit of 2, while maintaining a nearly constant focal length across the entire range. The 19-mm-diameter, 22.5-mm-focal-length optic enables a single compact platform for hyperspectral imaging, mid-IR microscopy, super-resolution, imaging through scattering media, and simultaneous multi-band and long-range imaging.

While our microscopic framework applies to generic magnon-phonon interactions, here we focus on high-symmetry crystals where the two transverse acoustic modes form a degenerate doublet. This doublet can combine into circularly polarized phonons, making the chiral selectivity of the coupling manifest: the FM magnon mode hybridizes only with the co-rotating phonon, whereas in collinear AFMs each magnon branch of opposite handedness couples to the phonon of the same chirality. We show that, in both FM and AFM systems, the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential conjugate to the conserved axial angular momentum. In FMs, the two hybrid branches in the co-rotating sector share this chemical potential, weighted by their magnonic fractions; in AFMs, the four magnon-polaron branches split into two chiral sectors that carry opposite angular momenta and couple with opposite sign to the same chemical potential. Building on this microscopic thermodynamic framework, we formulate a Boltzmann transport theory for magnon-polarons and derive compact expressions for angular-momentum and heat currents that interpolate continuously to the decoupled regime and reproduce the phenomenological magnon-polaron transport framework underlying previous spin Seebeck analyses."}

This report examines the parameters and dynamics of 2.5~MeV proton beam operations in two configurations of the bare IOTA lattice: one for demonstrating Non-linear Integrable Optics with the Danilov-Nagaitsev magnet, and the other for use with electron cooling. We offer order-of-magnitude estimates of the transverse emittance growth rate as a function of beam intensity, highlighting contributions from residual gas scattering, intra-beam scattering, and space-charge effects. Under nominal conditions, the beam lifetime is projected to be less than 7~minutes at low intensity with the current vacuum quality, and fewer than 100,000~turns at high intensity due to strong space-charge effects.

In preparation for the EXKALIBUR phase, which targets heavier kaonic atoms, new 1 mm-thick SDDs have been developed with Politecnico di Milano and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Their increased thickness enhances the quantum efficiency by a factor of about two at 30 keV while preserving excellent energy resolution. These detectors are also intended for VIP-3, the next-generation test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Building on VIP-2, which set the most stringent limits on PEP-violating $K_α$ transitions in copper, VIP-3 will extend the search to heavier elements such as Ag, Sn, and Zr.

We show that this result does not hold in the same class of solutions considered as physically viable near FLRW cosmological models, with the heat conduction vector interpreted as a peculiar velocity field.

Our setup follows the separating TBL study of Wu et al.\\ ({\\it J. Fluid Mech.}, vol.\\ 883, 2020, p.\\ A45). An equilibrium zero pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL is generated at a reference location, followed by imposition of a Gaussian suction profile to create a separation bubble. The ZPG TBLs over the riblets and the benchmark smooth case have matched momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{θ_0} = 583$ (friction Reynolds number 224). We employ a well-validated spectral-element solver, and leverage its unstructured-grid nature to generate an optimal grid, based on the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. At the reference location, the T9 and T6 riblets respectively increase and reduce drag, with viscous-scaled spacings $52$ and $13$. We discover that for both riblet cases, the mean separation location occurs at a distance of $140θ_0$ downstream of the reference location, $18\\%$ shorter than the mean separation distance for the smooth case ($170θ_0$). This outcome is related to the progressive enhancement of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers over the riblets, owing to the continuous rise in the adverse pressure-gradient. The KH rollers penetrate into the turbulent separation bubble, with significantly larger size and coherence compared to their counterparts upstream of the mean separation location."}

For static fields, this problem can be mitigated through the use of a superconducting holding field coil, which when operated in persistent current mode serves to stabilize the magnetic field. However, such a solution is not viable when time-varying magnetic fields are present, as is the case for the spin dressing mode of the proposed nEDMSF (nEDM super-fluid) experiment. This experiment features an oscillating magnetic field to dress the gyromagnetic ratios of $^3$He and neutrons to the same value, a condition known as critical dressing. Fluctuations in the dressing field amplitude have the potential to disrupt this condition. Here, we investigate a modification to spin dressing, termed ``magic dressing,'' which renders the system insensitive to small variations in dressing field amplitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this method for the single spin-species case using a sample of polarized $^3$He.

We show that a double gauging of this model, where one projects onto $SU(3)_R$ $R$-symmetry singlets, considerably simplifies the analysis of the non-graviton spectrum.

In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks.

Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications.

Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell."}

Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required."}

In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory."}

Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \\SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations.

We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders."}

Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution."}

Here we show that this ``quantum jump photodetector'' (QJPD) approach can also detect photon-level signals embedded in strong sunlight. Using a single rubidium atom as a QJPD, we count arrivals of individual narrow-band laser photons embedded in sunlight powers of order $10^{10}$ photons/s. We derive a rate-equation model for the atom's internal-state dynamics in sunlight, and find quantitative agreement with experiment. Using this model, we calculate the channel capacity over a noisy communication channel when sending weak coherent states and detecting them in the presence of sunlight, achieving a representative rate of 0.5 bits per symbol when sending 150 probe photons per 10 ms time-bin, embedded in 1 nW of sunlight (of order $10^{10}$ photons/s in the visible and near-infrared bands).

By deriving a set of nontrivial relations for this resolvent, we obtain exact expressions for the generating functions of Wilson loops in terms of the partition function. For large $k$, these expressions reproduce the weak-coupling expansion of the Wilson loops, and in the large-$N$ limit at fixed $k$ they match previously obtained high-precision numerical results. This analysis also resolves the longstanding discrepancy between numerical data and the semiclassical expression for the $1/6$ BPS Wilson loop."}

However, existing quantum topological algorithms, such as the LGZ algorithm, can only efficiently compute summary statistics like Betti numbers, failing to provide persistence diagram information that tracks the lifecycle of individual topological features, severely limiting their practical value. This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from \"quantum computation of Betti numbers\" to \"quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams.\" The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of \"classical precision guiding quantum efficiency.\" This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis."}

Through systematic benchmarks, we show that the Hilbert curve consistently yields lower ground-state energies at fixed bond dimension, with the advantage increasing for larger system sizes and in physically relevant interaction regimes. Our implementation reaches clusters up to $32\\times32$ sites with open and periodic boundary conditions, delivering reliable ground-state energies and correlation functions in agreement with established results, but at significantly reduced computational cost.

Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport."}

It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling.

The microwave is injected into the magnetron filter box using a self-designed injection structure, entering the resonant cavity through filament leads. The intrinsic isolation between the magnetrons output and filament is utilized as an isolator. No waveguide circulators or couplers between the injection source and the magnetron were used in the system, resulting in low cost and compact injection locking.

It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states."}

For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$.

When both conditions are satisfied, the resulting region is classified as a low-loss ENZ medium combining strong light confinement with reduced optical losses. To achieve this behavior in the mid-IR, heavily doped semiconductors are required, and those compatible with current technologies are most desirable. This work provides the first in-depth study, supported by experimental demonstrations, of the plasmonic properties of highly doped GaN thin films on Si, exhibiting low optical losses and low-loss ENZ characteristics up to $3μm$. From the extracted optical parameters, the ENZ and NZI regions are determined and compared with the existing literature. As a result of the large polar character of nitrides, a hybridization of the surface plasmon and phonon polaritons is observed, accompanied by a flat-dispersion of the high-energy mode (pinned near the plasma frequency) indicative of its ENZ character.

The evaporator's long roots effectively extracted water beneath 150 cm deep supernatant water layer. Through replantation of the evaporator to a separate location, an impressive evaporation rate (ER) of 4 kg/(m^2*h) close to 80 wt% solid concentration, a 25% increase to a non-replanted sample.

The probability distribution obtained by such snapshots (which are fundamentally limited to a negligible fraction of the Hilbert space) is of fundamental importance to determine the power of quantum computations. However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states. Our framework is of immediate experimental relevance, and can be further extended both in terms of more advanced network mathematics, including discrete homology, as well as in terms of applications to physical phenomena, such as time-dependent dynamics and gauge theories."}

In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC.

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime.

Quantum advantage is achieved when a practical problem is solved more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. Demonstrating quantum advantage requires a powerful quantum computer with low error rates and an efficient quantum algorithm that has a useful application. Despite rapid progress in hardware development, we still lack useful applications that are feasible for the next generation of quantum computers. Here we argue that an exponential quantum advantage exists in producing numerical resource estimates of larger quantum algorithms by accurately measuring simulation errors. We provide a quantum algorithm for measuring simulation errors of Trotter-based algorithms. Our results indicate that this method will reduce runtimes of quantum algorithms by approximately three orders of magnitude for one-hundred qubit systems. We also predict that these reductions will increase with system size. The methods we propose require relatively few qubits and operations, meaning the next generation of quantum computers could compute simulation errors for classically intractable systems.

This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries.

Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interaction mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of electronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state."}

Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence."}

However, despite their potential, working on-chip polaritonic elements demonstrating room temperature coherent lasing, controllable nonlinear propagation, or amplification have remained elusive.

Using a single-step microfluidic lithographic technique, we realize waveguide circuits with integrated gratings that simultaneously act as couplers and mirrors, forming in-plane Fabry-Pérot cavities. These structures support robust in-plane polariton lasing between gratings, yielding coherent emission along the waveguide. Furthermore, we observe clear signatures of strong nonlinear self-phase modulation and, for the first time, optical amplification of guided polaritons at room temperature.

Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles."}

However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (>$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz.

Two coherent phonon modes are identified: a high-frequency $A_{1g}$ mode ($ω_{1}$) and a lower-frequency $A_{1g}$ CDW amplitude mode ($ω_{2}$). In stark contrast to thermal melting, where phonons soften, the CDW amplitude mode exhibits anomalous hardening (frequency upshift) with increasing pump fluence. We establish this hardening as the direct signature of an ultrafast restoration of the bare lattice potential. The photoexcited carrier plasma screens the long-range electron-phonon interactions that drive the Peierls-like instability, effectively ``undressing\" the soft phonon and driving its frequency toward the stiffer value of the unrenormalized lattice. Furthermore, an abrupt increase in the excited state buildup time above a critical pump fluence marks a sharp boundary to a photoinduced metastable metallic state.

Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Owing to these advantages, the proposed modulated zone-plate scheme offers new possibilities for high-intensity laser physics and holds promise for applications such as laser wakefield acceleration, photon acceleration, and more."}

We derive a Ward identity for supertranslations and compute two point functions for the soft charges for 'in-in' correlators.

Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties.

In particular we concentrate on the simplest nontrivial case of two electrons in a box potential and calculate analytically the energy splitting between the lowest spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states, which is a relevant energy scale for the magnetic properties of the system. In the approximation of a fixed center of mass coordinate, the splitting decays exponentially with the square root of the distance between the electrons at the leading order. We show that the subleading exponential correction significantly increases the splitting and thus becomes crucial in order to describe correctly the exact numerical data for system sizes that are not astronomically large. Two methods of calculation of the energy splitting are developed. The first is based on the analysis of the exact solution that can be expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. It applies at all values of the short-distance cutoff played by the width of one-dimensional wire that regularizes the Coulomb potential. The second method is based on the quasiclassical (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which applies only for sufficiently large values of the cutoff. The two methods give identical result in the overlapping region. As a side result, our study gives the energy splitting in a triangular double well potential of inverse ``M'' shape."}

In contrast to the widely used Kerr--Melvin metric, the Kerr--BR spacetime is of algebraic type~D, admits a clear asymptotic structure, and allows for a systematic analytic treatment of geodesics. By analyzing the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we find that the external magnetic field consistently pushes the ISCO to larger radii \\(r_{\\rm ISCO}\\) for all spin configurations considered. Counterintuitively, despite this outward radial shift, the ISCO orbital frequency \\(Ω_{\\rm ISCO}\\) increases monotonically with the magnetic-field strength, leading to a robust ``blue-shift'' of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. We further show that retrograde orbits are significantly more sensitive to magnetic fields than prograde orbits, and identify a frequency crossover phenomenon in which magnetic corrections can invert the usual spin--frequency hierarchy at the ISCO. Finally, employing a semi-analytic adiabatic evolution scheme driven by exact geodesic relations and a leading-order quadrupole flux, we generate inspiral waveforms and quantify the substantial dephasing induced by the magnetic field. Our results indicate that large-scale magnetic environments can leave observable imprints in EMRI signals for future space-based detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, and that neglecting such effects in waveform models may introduce non-negligible biases in parameter estimation, particularly for the black-hole spin."}

We attribute this high readout contrast to a subset of V2 centers that have one spin-selective optical transition resonant with the laser. The ODMR contrast decreases with temperature, approaching the non-resonant contrast by 60 K, likely due to broadening of the optical transition linewidths.

We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation.

It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!"}

Similar modulations may also arise from orbital eccentricity, raising the possibility of degeneracies that could lead to false microlensing claims. We investigate the extent to which eccentric binary black hole (BBH) signals can mimic microlensing signatures produced by an isolated point-mass lens. With a simulated population of eccentric signals using numerical relativity simulations and \\texttt{TEOBResumS-Dalí} waveform model, we perform a Bayesian model-comparison study, supported by a complementary \\textit{mismatch} analysis. We find a strong degeneracy for high eccentricities, low total masses, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): under these conditions, quasicircular microlensed model can be strongly favored over quasicircular unlensed model, even when the true signal is unlensed. For moderate SNRs ($\\sim 30$), binaries with $M_\\mathrm{tot}\\lesssim 100\\,M_\\odot$ and eccentricity $e \\gtrsim 0.4$ are particularly susceptible to misclassifications. In such cases, inferred microlens parameters exhibit well-constrained posteriors despite being unphysical. Crucially, the degeneracy is completely removed when the recovery uses waveform models that incorporate eccentricity, which overwhelmingly favors the eccentric hypothesis over microlensing. Our results demonstrate that any event exhibiting strong Bayesian evidence for microlensing should also be analyzed with eccentric waveform models and vice-versa to avoid false positives and biased astrophysical inference.

In a closely related class of polynomial $α$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially.

This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction. We find that for scattering of Gaussian wavepackets in one dimension, the late time spectrum is dominated by two large eigenvalues nearly equal to the transmission and reflection probabilities associated with the central value of momentum. The corresponding eigenstates appear as single-peaked reflected or transmitted wavepackets. The remaining smaller eigenvalues, which increase to a maximum during scattering and then decrease to small values, correspond to reflected or transmitted wavepackets with multiple spatially separated parts. In this case and also for two-dimensional scattering, we find that successively smaller eigenvalues correspond to probability distributions with successively more peaks. These multi-peaked states correspond to outcomes of the scattering experiment where a particle initially in a single wavepacket ends up in a superposition of separated wavepackets after scattering."}

Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\\% and 89\\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m.

In nickelates, understanding the role of lattice is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degree of freedom in giving rise to various emergent phenomena reported recently. Here, we investigate the phononic DoF in a series of trilayer nickelates, namely Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 (where x = 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 3.6, and 4) using temperature and polarization dependent Raman scattering measurements. Our in-depth analysis of the phonon evolution with temperature and doping, gives interesting insights into the behaviour of these materials. All these systems undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT), characterized by the development of intertwined spin and charge density waves, with the spin density wave preceding the charge density wave. These transitions manifest as pronounced anomalies in phonon self-energy parameters i.e. peak frequency and linewidth in the vicinity of the metal-to-metal transition. Several phonon modes show dramatic change (nearly an order of magnitude for some modes) in their softening rates across the TMMT, highlighting the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to spin and charge order.

While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching."}

At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping."}

In the cosmological setup, this leads to correction to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the Universe. In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\\dot{\\mathcal{R}}\\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar. This yields a baryon asymmetry parameter $η\\propto l_0^2 T_D^9/M_{\\rm Pl}^7$. The observed baryon asymmetry $η\\sim 9.9 \\times 10^{-11}$ constrains $l_0 \\lesssim 7.1 \\times 10^{-33} m$, approximately $440$ times the Planck length. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the zero-point length correction in the Friedmann equation, effectively slows the expansion rate at high energies, resulting in a modified time-temperature relationship where the Universe maintains higher temperatures for longer time during early epochs compared to standard cosmology. Our results establish zero-point length cosmology as a testable framework connecting quantum gravity to cosmological observables, with implications for early universe thermal history and fundamental length scales."}

Here we extend EP physics into the temporal domain by introducing balanced gain--loss modulation in a photonic time crystal (PTC). A time-periodic refractive-index modulation $n(t)=n_{0}+δn\\cos(Ωt)$ generates an effective non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian that supports coalescence of quasi-eigenmodes in frequency space, constituting a genuine \\textit{temporal exceptional point}. Using a reduced two-mode model for the dominant frequency sidebands, we derive a non-Hermitian dimer Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{PT}}(Δ,γ,κ)$ that is strictly $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric for $Δ=0$ and identify the exact EP condition. Numerical analysis reveals the associated Riemann-sheet topology, mode exchange and Berry-phase accumulation upon encirclement of the EP, and the characteristic $\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ perturbation response indicative of enhanced sensing. We further construct a non-Hermitian transmission model that is exact within the reduced two-mode description, compute the Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for temperature estimation under an explicit noise model, and show that EP-enhanced sensitivity persists when compared to a linewidth-matched Hermitian reference under identical resource constraints. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the CRB is saturable using spectral measurements.

Quantifying this capability as a quantum-classical separation and demonstrating it on current quantum processors has remained elusive. Using a superconducting qubit processor, we show that quantum contextuality enables certain tasks to be performed with success probabilities beyond classical limits. With a few qubits, we illustrate quantum contextuality with the magic square game, as well as quantify it through a Kochen--Specker--Bell inequality violation. To examine many-body contextuality, we implement the N-player GHZ game and separately solve a 2D hidden linear function problem, exceeding classical success rate in both. Our work proposes novel ways to benchmark quantum processors using contextuality-based algorithms."}

Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions."}

We find strong, non-monotonic variations in the mode frequency relative to standard no-shell models.

The metalens consists of unit cells, each containing a thin silicon rod.

The nanorods are placed on a 70 nm thick silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer, with a 50 nm thick gold (Au) reflective layer underneath. In contrast to conventional transmissive metalenses, our design accomplishes complete 2π phase control via geometry-optimized silicon nanorods, facilitating compact reflective optics. By carefully examining the impact of nanorod dimensions on optical performance, the main goal is to optimize the metalens design for enhanced light focusing and manipulation, which could benefit imaging systems, optical communications, and sensor technology."}

This is the case for gravity, even in exactly solvable models such as minisuperspace or low-dimensional theories: the physical states do not inherit an inner product in a straightforward manner, and different quantization procedures yield a priori inequivalent prescriptions. This is one of the main challenges when constructing gravitational Hilbert spaces. In this paper we study a quantization procedure known as group averaging, which is a special case of the BRST/BV formalism and has gained popularity as a promising connection between Dirac quantization and gravitational path integrals. We identify a large class of theories for which group averaging is ill-defined due to isometry groups with infinite volume, which includes Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We propose a modification of group averaging to renormalize these infinite volumes and use it to quantize Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with a positive cosmological constant in closed universes. The resulting Hilbert space naturally splits into infinite-dimensional superselection sectors and has a positive-definite inner product. This is the first complete Dirac quantization of this theory, as we are able to capture all the physical states for the first time."}

Furthermore, we show that this upper bound scales as the square of the product of the inverse temperature and the evolution time. In the low-temperature limit, we establish an additional upper bound expressed as the seminorm of the commutator divided by the energy gap.

The probability distribution obtained by such snapshots (which are fundamentally limited to a negligible fraction of the Hilbert space) is of fundamental importance to determine the power of quantum computations. However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states. Our framework is of immediate experimental relevance, and can be further extended both in terms of more advanced network mathematics, including discrete homology, as well as in terms of applications to physical phenomena, such as time-dependent dynamics and gauge theories."}

We find that geometries giving rise to baby universes are always subdominant. It follows that the baby universe does not provide a semi-classical description of the state since it is encoded in an exponentially suppressed part of the wave function. We then apply a prescription developed in \\cite{Belin:2025wju} to make the baby universe geometry the leading saddle. In the process, the CFT state becomes mixed, in agreement with the qualitative gravitational picture.

A key challenge in this domain is the encoding of input data, which plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of QML models. In this work, we tackle a largely unaddressed aspect of encoding that is unique to QML modeling -- rather than adjusting the ansatz used for encoding, we consider adjusting how data is conveyed to the ansatz. We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications. Finally we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by running it using real quantum hardware with 100 qubit circuits and successfully achieving improved QML modeling performance in this case as well."}

Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution."}

We introduce the Quantum-Based Self-Attention for Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (QBSA-DQAS), a meta-learning framework featuring quantum-based self-attention and hardware-aware multi-objective search. The framework employs a two-stage quantum self-attention module that computes contextual dependencies by mapping architectural parameters through parameterized quantum circuits, replacing classical similarity metrics with quantum-derived attention scores, then applies position-wise quantum transformations for feature enrichment. Architecture search is guided by a task-agnostic multi-objective function jointly optimizing noisy expressibility and Probability of Successful Trials (PST). A post-search optimization stage applies gate commutation, fusion, and elimination to reduce circuit complexity. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance on VQE tasks and large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks. For VQE on H$_2$, QBSA-DQAS achieves 0.9 accuracy compared to 0.89 for standard DQAS. Post-search optimization reduces discovered circuit complexity by up to 44% in gate count and 47% in depth without accuracy degradation. The framework maintains robust performance across three molecules and five IBM quantum hardware noise models. For WSN routing, discovered circuits achieve 8.6% energy reduction versus QAOA and 40.7% versus classical greedy methods, establishing the effectiveness of quantum-native architecture search for NISQ applications."}

It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects.

In a closely related class of polynomial $α$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $α$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data."}

This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction. We find that for scattering of Gaussian wavepackets in one dimension, the late time spectrum is dominated by two large eigenvalues nearly equal to the transmission and reflection probabilities associated with the central value of momentum. The corresponding eigenstates appear as single-peaked reflected or transmitted wavepackets. The remaining smaller eigenvalues, which increase to a maximum during scattering and then decrease to small values, correspond to reflected or transmitted wavepackets with multiple spatially separated parts. In this case and also for two-dimensional scattering, we find that successively smaller eigenvalues correspond to probability distributions with successively more peaks. These multi-peaked states correspond to outcomes of the scattering experiment where a particle initially in a single wavepacket ends up in a superposition of separated wavepackets after scattering."}

Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states."}

In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects."}

Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence."}

Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability.

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments."}

However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems."}

Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states."}

Current progress focuses on integrating optical and electronic components into microfabricated ion traps to allow scaling to large numbers of ion qubits. Most available fabrication strategies for such integrated processors employ monolithic integration of all processor components and rely heavily on CMOS-compatible semiconductor fabrication technologies that are not optimized for the requirements of a trapped-ion quantum processor. In this work, we present a modular approach in which the processor modules, called chiplets, have specific functions and are fabricated separately. The individual chiplets are then combined using heterogeneous integration techniques. This strategy opens up the possibility of choosing the optimal materials and fabrication technology for each of the chiplets, with a minimum amount of fabrication limitations compared to the monolithic approach. Chiplet technology furthermore enables novel processor functionalities to be added in a cost-effective, modular fashion by adding or modifying only a subset of the chiplets. We describe the design concept of a chiplet-based trapped-ion quantum processor and demonstrate the technology with an example of an integrated individual-ion addressing system for a ten-ion crystal. The addressing system emphasizes the modularity of the chiplet approach, combining a surface ion trap manufactured on a glass substrate with a silicon substrate carrying integrated waveguides and a stack of 3D-printed micro-optics, achieving diffraction-limited focal spots at the ion positions."}

I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy. Finally, I present four different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the minimax optimization underlying training, and I discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees."}

This work demonstrates experimental evidence of time-domain dynamics of magnon-photon systems that are coupled through a long-range interaction (i.e. remote coupling) exhibiting level attraction mediated by an auxiliary mode. We directly observe the temporal evolution of dissipatively coupled cavity-magnon modes, where heavily damped transmission line modes mediate the interaction. Our frequency-domain measurements confirm the predicted level attraction, while time-domain ring-down measurements reveal the characteristic signatures of dissipative coupling dynamics.

A useful measure of multipartite entanglement is the minimal decomposition entropy, defined as the minimum of the Rényi entropy $ S_q $ associated with the state's decomposition over all local product bases. This quantity identifies the product bases in which the state is maximally localized, thereby yielding optimal representations for analyzing local-unitary equivalence and structural properties of multipartite states.\n  We investigate the minimal decomposition entropy for absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states, a class of highly entangled states characterized by their maximal entanglement across any bipartitions. We present a numerical algorithm for computing the minimal decomposition entropy for finite $ q>1 $. Entropy distributions for AME and Haar random states are obtained for $ q=2 $ and $ q=\\infty $ in qubit, qutrit, and ququad systems. For $ q=2 $, AME states of four qutrits and four ququads exhibit smaller minimal decomposition entropy than Haar random states, indicating more localized optimal representations. For $ q=\\infty $, corresponding to the geometric measure of entanglement, AME states display higher entanglement than Haar random states. The algorithm additionally produces simpler and sparser decompositions of known AME states, aiding in distinguishing genuinely quantum AME states from those associated with classical combinatorial designs."}

While prior work by Gottesman showed that constant qubit overhead is achievable under stochastic noise using quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, it has remained an open question whether similar guarantees hold under more general, non-stochastic noise models. In this work, we address this question by considering a general circuit-level noise model defined via the diamond norm, which captures both stochastic and non-stochastic noise, including coherent and amplitude damping noise. We prove that constant qubit overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation is achievable in this general setting, using QLDPC codes with constant rate and linear minimum distance. To establish our result, we develop a fault-tolerant error correction scheme and a method for implementing logic gates under general circuit noise. These results extend the theoretical foundations of fault-tolerant quantum computation and offer new directions for fault-tolerant architectures under realistic noise models."}

We evaluate this QMR constitution analytically on classical profile data and implement its final measurement stage as a quantum circuit, running on both noiseless simulators and noisy IBM quantum hardware to map how realistic noise deforms the resulting societal ranking distribution. Moderate-high single-qubit noise does not change the qualitative behavior of QMR, whereas strong noise shifts the distribution toward other dominant winners than the classical one. We quantify this behavior using winner-agreement rates, Condorcet-winner flip rates, and Jensen-Shannon divergence between societal ranking distributions. In a second, exploratory component, we demonstrate an explicitly entanglement-based variant of the QMR constitution that serves as a testbed for multi-voter quantum correlations under noise, which we refer to as the QMR2-inspired variant. There, GHZ-type and separable superpositions over opposite rankings have the same expectation values but respond very differently to noise. Taken together, these two components connect the abstract QMR constitution to concrete implementations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and highlight design considerations for future quantum voting protocols."}

We propose a levitated optomechanical platform capable of generating controllable Schrodinger-cat states in the center of mass motion of a dielectric nanosphere. A comprehensive master equation incorporates gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, establishing a calibrated environmental baseline. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is embedded within the same framework, predicting a characteristic saturation of the decoherence rate with superposition size and a quadratic scaling with mass.

In particular, reconfigurable integrated photonic circuits offer a promising route, thanks to the possibility of implementing adaptive feedback loops, which is an essential ingredient for achieving the necessary nonlinear behavior characteristic of neural networks. Here, we implement a quantum reservoir computing protocol in which information is processed through a reconfigurable linear optical integrated photonic circuit and measured using single-photon detectors. We exploit a multiphoton-based setup for time-series forecasting tasks in a variety of scenarios, where the input signal is encoded in one of the circuit's optical phases, thus modulating the quantum reservoir state. The resulting output probabilities are used to set the feedback phases and, at the end of the computation, are fed to a classical digital layer trained via linear regression to perform predictions. We then focus on the investigation of the role of input photon indistinguishability in the reservoir's capabilities of predicting time-series. We experimentally demonstrate that two-photon indistinguishable input states lead to significantly better performance compared to distinguishable ones. This enhancement arises from the quantum correlations present in indistinguishable states, which enable the system to approximate higher-order nonlinear functions when using comparable physical resources, highlighting the importance of quantum interference and indistinguishability as a resource in photonic quantum reservoir computing."}

Breaking unitarity can lead to the purification of mixed initial states, which corresponds to the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence the absence of a key signature of dynamical chaos. However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. We show that exponentially slow purification arises from a distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane that forms a ring with sharp edges at large radii, with the eigenvalue density exponentially large near these edges. We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane. By calculating the spectral form factor we also show that there is level repulsion around the azimuthal direction, even close to the outer edge of the ring of eigenvalues. Our results connect this spectral signature of quantum chaos to the sensitivity of the system to its initial conditions."}

In this framework, the coherent propagation of a quantum walker over a graph encodes its structural properties into state amplitudes, enabling the identification of highly influential vertices through their transition probabilities. To enhance stability and solution quality, we introduce a dynamic decoupling (``freezing'') mechanism that isolates vertices already selected for the cover, preventing their interference in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. The method employs a compact binary encoding, requiring only $\\lceil \\log_2 (V)\\rceil$ qubits to represent a graph with $V$ vertices, resulting in an exponential reduction of quantum resources compared to conventional vertex-based encodings. We benchmark the proposed heuristic against exact solutions obtained via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and against established classical heuristics, including Simulated Annealing, FastVC, and the 2-Approximation algorithm, across Erdős--Rényi, Barabási--Albert and regular random graph ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the CTQW-based heuristic consistently achieves superior approximation ratios and exhibits remarkable robustness with respect to network topology, outperforming classical approaches in both heterogeneous and homogeneous structures. These findings indicate that continuous-time quantum walks, when combined with topology-independent decoupling strategies, provide a powerful paradigm for large-scale combinatorial optimization and complex network control, with potential applications spanning infrastructure resilience, epidemic containment, sensor network optimization, and biological systems analysis."}

In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry."}

However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport."}

Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results."}

The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model."}

To obtain indistinguishable photons, the source is pumped on resonance with polarized laser pulses, and the output is collected in orthogonal polarization. However, for sources featuring vertical emission of light, 50% of the emitted photons are unavoidably lost in this way. Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity that favors emission in a specific polarization. We identify the configuration for optimal state initialization and demonstrate a path toward near-unity polarized efficiency. We also derive simple analytical formulas for the photon output in each polarization as a function of the Purcell-enhanced emission rates, which shed light on the physical mechanism behind our results."}

These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\\% and 89\\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing."}

This challenging task can be achieved with Zinc Blende GaAs nanowires. They already have shown an efficient photon pairs generation via SPDC at 1550 nm.
