In this\narticle, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the\nMacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a\ncosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of\nthe resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on\nshell.

When\nthis decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even\nwith couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks.

This presents a significant challenge\nfor near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Amplitude Estimation (AWQAE)\nframework, a modular, scalable and adaptive approach that decouples estimation\nprecision from the number of physical qubits required in a single circuit.\nAWQAE operates by iteratively estimating the phase bits in small, fixed-size\nchunks, using a number of smaller, independent quantum circuits, which are\namenable to parallel processing. A key technical contribution of this work is\nintroduction of a phase resolution circuit and an ancilla-guided mechanism that\nenables accurate chunk assignment and eigenphase reconstruction in the presence\nof multiple eigenstates. This design is inherently NISQ-friendly, by lowering\ncircuit depth and qubit count per block to reduce decoherence and noise\neffects. A key component of our approach is a robust classical post-processing\nalgorithm that resolves measurement ambiguities that arise during the iterative\nprocess. This post-processing routine uses a least-significant-bit\n(LSB)-to-most-significant-bit (MSB) correction to reconstruct the full,\nhigh-precision phase estimate, ensuring accuracy. By combining a modular\nquantum-classical loop with an ambiguity-aware reconstruction method, AWQAE\noffers a powerful and flexible solution for performing high-precision QAE on\nresource-constrained quantum hardware.

These phases represent\nsubtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical\nor Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak\nwaves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive\nphase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical\ndescription. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric\nprotocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become\nentangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of\nthe LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly\nquantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering\nan alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain."}

However, contrary to what was commonly\nassumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much\nlarger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the\nsuperposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems\nwhose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very\npromising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this\nwork, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant\nformalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account\nfor the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings\nwith external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the\n(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when\nattainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in\nterms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When\nthis decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even\nwith couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We\nthen apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of\nquantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)\ncharged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our\nclocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix\n$\\rho_{\\tau_2|\\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields\nnot only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical\nexpected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum\nfluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile."}

Here we demonstrate that\ntwo-dimensional Coulomb crystals can emulate molecular isomerization and be\nused to characterize its physical mechanisms. In our molecular analogue, the\nconfining potential acts as an electronic orbital, which can be tuned\ncontinuously and dynamically. We use a planar crystal of six 138Ba+ ions, which\nexhibits two stable configurations depending on the aspect ratio of the\nharmonic trapping potential. By changing this aspect ratio, we directly modify\nthe potential energy surface (PES) of the ion crystal, and trigger\nisomerization in a controlled way. We identify a region of bistability between\nthe two isomers, and use configuration-resolved imaging to detect isomerization\nin real time. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the double well\nPES. By comparing simulated transition rates with experimental population\nratios, we estimate the crystal's temperature. Additionally, we prepare\nmetastable configurations by rapidly quenching the PES, and detect\nisomerization dynamics with sub-millisecond resolution.

Micro-ring resonator is an ideal platform for studying\non-chip photon sources due to strong nonlinear effect, resonant-enhanced\noptical fields, and high integration.
