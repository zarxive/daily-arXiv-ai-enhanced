<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photodetectors, especially UV-sensitive ones, are crucial for applications like medical imaging, security, and telecommunications. Enhancing their efficiency, stability, and tunability is essential for practical use. The paper addresses these challenges through innovative device architecture and material engineering.

Method: The authors developed a gallium nitride HEMT photodetector by integrating various advanced materials and structural designs. They used an n-GaN buffer, an InN channel layer, a h-BN interlayer, dual passivation (SiN and h-BN), a p-GaN layer for 2DEG confinement, and including Ni electrodes and a recessed gate. Numerical simulations were employed to evaluate the device's performance and validate the effectiveness of the materials and structures.

Result: The photodetector demonstrates exceptional performance under UV illumination, with high photo-to-dark current ratios (PDCR) of approximately 1e6. It achieves consistent stability with leakage currents suppressed to ~1e-10 A, significantly lower than literature values. Structural parameters like p-GaN width and doping concentration offer tunability, making the device adaptable to different applications.

Conclusion: This GaN-based photodetector represents a significant advancement in UV photodetectors, offering high efficiency, stability, and tunable performance. By integrating advanced material strategies, the device addresses key challenges in photodetector applications.

Abstract: This work presents a novel Gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility
transistor (HEMT) based ultraviolet photodetector architecture integrating
advanced material and structural design strategies to enhance detection
performance and stability under room-temperature operation. The device is
constructed on a high-thermal-conductivity silicon carbide (SiC) substrate and
incorporates an n-GaN buffer, an indium nitride (InN) channel layer for
improved electron mobility and two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confinement,
and a dual-passivation scheme combining silicon nitride (SiN) and hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN). A p-GaN layer is embedded between the passivation
interfaces to deplete the 2DEG in dark conditions. Lateral nickel (Ni) source
and drain electrodes and a recessed gate positioned within the substrate ensure
enhanced electric field control and noise suppression. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that the integration of a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interlayer
within the dual passivation stack effectively suppresses the gate leakage
current from typical literature values of the order of $10^{-7}$~A to
approximately $10^{-10}$~A, highlighting its critical role in enhancing
interfacial insulation. In addition, consistent with previous reports, the use
of a silicon carbide (SiC) substrate offers significantly improved thermal
management over sapphire, enabling more stable operation under UV illumination.
The device demonstrates strong photoresponse under 360~nm ultraviolet (UV)
illumination, high photo-to-dark current ratios (PDCR) of approximately
$10^{6}$, and tunable performance via structural optimization of p-GaN width
between 0.40~$\mu$m and 1.60~$\mu$m, doping concentration from $5 \times
10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$ to $5 \times 10^{18}$~cm$^{-3}$, and embedding depth between
0.060~$\mu$m and 0.068~$\mu$m.

Abstract: Photonic computing chips have made significant progress in accelerating
linear computations, but nonlinear computations are usually implemented in the
digital domain, which introduces additional system latency and power
consumption, and hinders the implementation of fully-functional photonic neural
network chips. Here, we propose and fabricate a 16-channel programmable
incoherent photonic neuromorphic computing chip by co-designing a simplified
MZI mesh and distributed feedback lasers with saturable absorber array using
different materials, enabling implementation of both linear and nonlinear spike
computations in the optical domain. Furthermore, previous studies mainly
focused on supervised learning and simple image classification tasks. Here, we
propose a photonic spiking reinforcement learning (RL) architecture for the
first time, and develop a software-hardware collaborative training-inference
framework to address the challenge of training spiking RL models. We achieve
large-scale, energy-efficient (photonic linear computation: 1.39 TOPS/W,
photonic nonlinear computation: 987.65 GOPS/W) and low-latency (320 ps)
end-to-end deployment of an entire layer of photonic spiking RL. Two RL
benchmarks include the discrete CartPole task and the continuous Pendulum tasks
are demonstrated experimentally based on spiking proximal policy optimization
algorithm. The hardware-software collaborative computing reward value converges
to 200 (-250) for the CartPole tasks, respectively, comparable to that of a
traditional PPO algorithm. This experimental demonstration addresses the
challenge of the absence of large-scale photonic nonlinear spike computation
and spiking RL training difficulty, and presents a high-speed and low-latency
photonic spiking RL solution with promising application prospects in fields
such as real-time decision-making and control for robots and autonomous
driving.

Abstract: High-energy, narrow-linewidth nanosecond pulses are highly demanding for many
applications that require high temporal and spatial coherence. However, the
amplification of narrow-linewidth pulses is primarily limited by stimulated
Brillouin scattering, which causes pulse instabilities, back-reflected pulses,
and catastrophic damage effects on optical components. In this work, we present
a 1.6 mJ narrow-linewidth nanosecond pulsed fiber laser system based on
all-glass spun tapered double-clad fibers without employing any mitigating
technique for the stimulated Brillouin scattering effect. The system delivers
pulses with an 8 ns duration at a 100 kHz repetition rate, over 97.5% degree of
polarization, a beam quality factor of M2 = 1.3, a spectral linewidth of 53.8
MHz, a 160 W average power, and 188 kW peak power with a slope efficiency of
97.6%. The degree of spatial coherence of the amplified signal was measured to
be 0.94. Our results are highly valued in applications requiring high-energy,
high-coherence pulses with spectral, spatial, and polarization characteristics
in a compact system.

Abstract: Optical atomic clocks deliver unrivaled precision, yet their size and
complexity still confine them to specialized laboratories. Frequency combs
provide the crucial optical-to-microwave division needed for clock readout, but
conventional fiber- or bulk-laser combs are far too large for portable use. The
advent of chip-integrated microcombs, frequency combs generated in micron-scale
resonators, has revolutionized this landscape, enabling fully miniaturized,
low-power clocks that bridge optical and radio-frequency domains on a single
chip. Nevertheless, stabilizing a microcomb solely through pump laser control
entangles otherwise independent feedback parameters, injects extra technical
noise, and prevents flexible partial division of the optical frequency. Here,
we propose and demonstrate a universal on-chip optical-clock architecture that
supports both partial and full optical division. A hybrid passive-active scheme
enables locking any two microcomb teeth independently, eliminating
cross-coupling of control loops. Using the pump laser as a nonlinear actuator
to stabilize an arbitrary tooth, we achieve a residual relative frequency
instability of 1e-16. This advance brings integrated optical clocks closer to
real-world deployment and opens new avenues for precision timing and
navigation.

Abstract: We reveal an instantaneous optical valley selection rule that illuminates the
coupling between the instantaneous optical chirality of the driving laser field
and the chirality of valley systems. Building on this principle, we propose and
demonstrate that a single chirality-separated optical field, in which
oppositely signed instantaneous optical chiralities are separated within an
optical cycle, enables independent manipulation of currents from $\rm K$ and
$\rm K^{\prime}$ valleys.Based on this scheme, we highlight two key example
applications: (1) complete separation of currents from different valleys,
yielding 100\%-purity valley-polarized currents, and (2) generation of pure
valley current with zero net charge flow. Our work offers a robust and highly
controllable all-optical strategy for ultrafast engineering valley currents in
the optical cycle timescale, paving a new avenue for valleytronics and quantum
information technologies.

Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes
light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing
of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier.
Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum
emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical
solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit,
we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity
enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands.
When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters
hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau
polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable
via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further
exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by
nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics
with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool
for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer,
and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for
applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.

Abstract: The semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) with a dephasing operator for the
microscopic polarizations are a well established approach to simulate
high-harmonic spectra in solids. We discuss the impact of the dephasing
operator on the stability of the numerical integration of the SBEs in the
Wannier gauge. It is shown that the standard approach to apply dephasing is
ill-defined in the presence of band crossings and leads to artifacts in the
carrier distribution. They are caused by rapid changes of the dephasing
operator matrix elements in the Wannier gauge, which render the convergence of
the simulation in the stationary basis infeasible. In the comoving basis, also
called Houston basis, these rapid changes can be resolved, but only at the cost
of a largely increased computation time. As a remedy, we propose a modification
of the dephasing operator with reduced magnitude in energetically close
subspaces. This approach removes the artifacts in the carrier distribution and
significantly speeds up the calculations, while affecting the high-harmonic
spectrum only marginally. To foster further development, we provide our
parallelized source code.

*Abhishek Mall,Zhou Shen,Kartik Ayyer*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses a modified X-ray single particle imaging technique that uses a 2D crystal lattice to enhance resolution by suppressing background scattering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome current limitations in X-ray free electron laser-based X-ray single particle imaging by utilizing a crystal lattice to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.

Method: The method involves placing a strongly scattering 2D crystal lattice near the sample and using computational algorithms to retrieve the structure from the enhanced Bragg peaks.

Result: The computational method improves resolution and allows higher sensitivity to the object signal, making it feasible to use at wider range of synchrotron sources.

Conclusion: This technique has the potential to advance X-ray single particle imaging by expanding its accessibility and improving resolution capabilities.

Abstract: X-ray single particle imaging (SPI) has offered the potential to visualize
structures of biomolecules at near-atomic resolution. However, state-of-the-art
structures at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) are limited to moderate
resolution, primarily due to background scattering. We computationally explore
a modified SPI technique based on holographic enhancement from a strongly
scattering 2D crystal lattice placed near the object. The Bragg peaks from the
crystal enable structure retrieval even for background levels up to 10$^{5}$
times higher than the object signal. This method could enable SPI at more
widely accessible synchrotron sources, where even detection of objects before
radiation damage is nearly impossible currently, supports practical
fixed-target sample delivery, and enables high-resolution imaging under
near-native conditions. Numerical simulations with a custom reconstruction
algorithm to recover the latent parameters show the potential to improve the
achievable resolution while also expanding the accessibility to the technique.

Result: Achieved 1 dB/cm and 1.3 dB/cm loss at 8.5 μm (TE/TM), 0.28 dB/cm at 4.6 μm (TM). Quality factors over 600,000 at 4.6 μm, indicating significant efficiency for future nonlinear applications.

Conclusion:  Barrage of modern devices rely on nonlinear processes, which may depend on efficient mid-IR resonators. Their work shows promise with high Q factors and low losses, opening doors for future nonlinear optical devices.

Abstract: We demonstrate mid-IR integrated race-track resonators on a III-V
semiconductor platform,InGaAs core epitaxially grown on InP. We have performed
a complete characterization of the optical propagation losses at wavelength =
4.6 um and wavelength = 8.5 um, two representative wavelengths for the 1st and
2nd atmospheric transparency windows. We measured losses of 1 dB/cm (TE
polarization) and 1.3 dB/cm (TM polarization) at 8.5 um. Substantially lower
losses, 0.28 dB/cm, were measured at wavelength = 4.6 um (TM polarization). We
then implemented racetrack resonators with straight evanescent couplers. We
obtained loaded quality factors larger than 600.000 at wavelength = 4.6 um.
These results are promising towards the development of non-linear mid-IR
integrated devices with Q factors beyond a million, where the onset of
stimulated parametric processes could be reachable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perovskite quantum dots show potential as wavelength-tunable single photon sources, but their integration into nanophotonic structures is challenging due to random distribution and non-directional emission.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable method for integrating quantum dots into nanophotonic circuits, leveraging Purcell effect for improved efficiency and quantum efficiency.

Abstract: Perovskite quantum dots hold great promise for quantum information processing
as wavelength-tunable single photon sources operable over a broad temperature
range. However, their deterministic integration into nanophotonic structures
remains a major challenge, limited by their random spatial distribution and
non-directional emission. In this work, we employ a two-step electron beam
lithography process to deterministically place CsPbBr3 quantum dots within the
mode volume of plasmonic ring microcavities. Simulations predict strong field
enhancement within the cavity, boosting photon emission rates via the Purcell
effect and improving the quantum efficiency of the emitters. Experimentally,
coupling ensembles of CsPbBr3 quantum dots to the cavities results in a
four-fold enhancement in photoluminescence intensity and a three-fold reduction
in fluorescence lifetime at room temperature. Single-emitter coupling is
further investigated at cryogenic temperatures, leading to a two-fold reduction
in radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate a scalable approach for the
integration of perovskite quantum dots into nanophotonic cavities and quantum
photonic circuits.

Abstract: Performing simultaneous depth-of-field (DoF) extension and edge enhancement
within a single optical element remains a fundamental challenge in advanced
imaging. Here, we propose a wavelength-tunable nonlocal Huygens' metasurface
capable of simultaneously extracting depth and edge features of images in a
single-shot exposure. Using the selective polarization response of the Huygens'
metasurfaces, the circularly polarized converted component undergoes geometric
phase modulation for wavefront shaping to extend the DoF, while the
non-converted component acts as a spatial frequency filter to enhance edge
contrast. The integration of a phase-change material, Sb$_{2}$S$_{3}$, enables
continuous tuning of the resonance wavelength across a range of 100 nm by
modulating its refractive index, granting the system excellent broadband
spectral adaptability. This work offers a novel and compact solution for
real-time depth sensing and feature extraction in applications such as
autonomous navigation and biomedical imaging.

*Davood Momeni*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for reconstructing effective Hamiltonians from gravitational energy densities, using tools from relativistic kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and thermodynamics. It suggests applications across cosmology, quantum gravity, and holography, providing a novel route to study spacetime emergence through observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind the paper is to develop a systematic method to extract microscopic dynamics from macroscopic energy densities, addressing the challenge of understanding spacetime emergence from thermodynamic observables.

Method: The method involves starting from local thermal equilibrium and Liouville dynamics, deriving an inverse procedure to relate energy density ρ(x) to a distribution function f(x,p), which is then used to recover the Hamiltonian H(x,p) through functional inversion. This combines relativistic kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and covariant thermodynamics.

Result: The result is a general framework that connects macroscopic energy densities with microscopic Hamiltonians across various theories, including FLRW cosmology, Loop Quantum Gravity, AdS/CFT, and the SYK model, offering new insights into spacetime emergence.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of this approach to bridge geometry, entropy, and Hamiltonian dynamics in curved spacetime, providing a new tool for studying spacetime emergence through observable densities. It suggests exciting future applications in different areas of theoretical physics.

Abstract: We present a general framework for reconstructing effective Hamiltonians from
known gravitational energy density profiles in curved spacetime. Starting from
local thermal equilibrium and Liouville dynamics, we establish an inverse
procedure that relates the macroscopic energy density \( \rho(x) \) to a
distribution function \( f(x,p) \sim e^{-\beta H(x,p)} \), and recovers the
underlying Hamiltonian \( H(x,p) \) via functional inversion. This approach
synthesizes tools from relativistic kinetic theory, statistical mechanics, and
covariant gravitational thermodynamics, offering a systematic way to extract
microscopic dynamics from coarse-grained energy observables. Applications
include FLRW cosmology, Loop Quantum Gravity corrections, AdS/CFT holography,
and the SYK model. Our results provide a novel route for probing emergent
spacetime dynamics through observable densities, bridging geometry, entropy,
and Hamiltonian flow in curved backgrounds.

Abstract: In this study, we examine the thermodynamics of black holes immersed in
perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) by employing the Misner-Sharp energy
framework. We extend the analysis to include the thermal fluctuations of these
black holes when size reduces to small size, redefining key thermodynamic
variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, and entropy
within the context of PFDM. Using these newly defined variables, we
systematically calculate the enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat of
PFDM black holes, incorporating perturbative thermal corrections. To assess the
stability of these black holes, we perform a detailed graphical analysis of the
specific heat as a function of the horizon radius, providing insights into the
thermal stability of PFDM black holes. This comprehensive approach enhances our
understanding of the thermodynamic properties and stability of black holes in
the presence of dark matter.

### [17] [The Dynamics of Cosmic Evolution: Insights from Bouncing Cosmology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06586)
*M. Sharif,M. Zeeshan Gul,Ahmad Nawaz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores bouncing cosmological solutions in f(Q,C) gravity, examining dynamics of Bianchi I spacetime with perfect fluid. Various functionals are tested, and it's found that while viable bounce solutions exist, they breach null energy conditions. The equation of state shows quintessence or phantom behavior, suggesting accelerating expansion. f(Q,C) could offer an alternative to standard cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the exploration of alternative gravitational frameworks in cosmology, particularly focusing on bouncing universes which avoid big bang singularities. This is driven by the desire to find viable models explaining cosmic acceleration without resorting to dark energy, which is a popular but still debated topic in theoretical cosmology.

Method: The authors analyze a Bianchi type-I spacetime using f(Q,C) gravity with different functionals. They consider non-singular bounce solutions and employ linear perturbation to study stability. The analysis includes checking null energy conditions and equation of state parameter trends.

Result: Bounce solutions exist but violate null energy conditions. The equation of state indicates quintessence or phantom behavior, leading to accelerating expansion. f(Q,C) offers an alternative cosmological model.

Conclusion: The study contributes to exploring modified gravity models for cosmic acceleration and early universe dynamics, suggesting f(Q,C) as a promising alternative to standard cosmology.

Abstract: The primary aim of this work is to explore feasible bouncing cosmological
solutions in the framework of $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{C})$ gravity, where
$\mathcal{Q}$ denotes non-metricity and $\mathcal{C}$ indicates the boundary
term. To achieve this, we analyze the dynamics of a Bianchi type-I spacetime
with perfect fluid distribution. We consider various functional forms of
$f(\mathcal{Q,C})$ theory to assess how this modified gravity framework
influences cosmic evolution. Additionally, we examine the dynamics of different
cosmological parameters to explore non-singular bounce solutions. We also use
linear perturbation to study the stability analysis. Our findings reveal the
breach of the null energy conditions, which is required for the existence of
viable bounce solutions. The equation of state parameter demonstrates either a
quintessence phase or a phantom regime of the universe, demonstrating that the
cosmos is undergoing accelerating expansion. This gravitational framework
presents a promising alternative to the standard cosmological model, presenting
an innovative viewpoint on gravitational interactions and the dynamics of the
early universe.

Conclusion: 重构f(R)模型并通过分析确认了旋涡效应的存在，为研究宇宙的循环演化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing universes
within the framework of analytically reconstructed $f(R)$ gravity. Using exact
bouncing scale factor solutions of exponential and power-law forms, we
reconstruct the corresponding $f(R)$ models and investigate the thermodynamic
behavior of a minimally coupled scalar field in these geometries. The pressure
evolution during expansion and contraction phases is shown to be asymmetric,
leading to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral over each cycle, defined
by $\oint p_\phi\, dV$. We identify closed hysteresis loops in the
equation-of-state space and quantify the net energy transfer per cycle. Our
results reveal that such reconstructed $f(R)$ models generically support
irreversible evolution, demonstrating a natural emergence of the thermodynamic
arrow of time. These findings provide new insight into the dissipative features
of modified gravity and the long-term dynamics of cyclic cosmological
scenarios.

Conclusion: 结论支持在所有亚临界旋转范围内的Kerr-de Sitter黑洞满足振型稳定性假设，从而具有稳定性。研究为理解黑洞稳定性提供了更广泛的理论支持，特别是在非缓慢旋转的情况下。

Abstract: We show the stability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes, in the full subextremal
range, as solutions of the vacuum Einstein equation with a positive
cosmological constant under the assumption that mode stability holds for these
spacetimes. The method is similar to the (unconditional) proof in the slowly
rotating case by Hintz and Vasy. The key novelties are the implementation of
constraint damping in the full subextremal range as well as the verification of
a subprincipal symbol condition at the trapped set.

Conclusion: 研究为理解潜在的暗物质和相关相变提供了新的物理框架。

Abstract: We explore the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Dyonic-ModMax
(EDM) black holes (BHs) incorporating quantum gravity corrections and plasma
effects. The ModMax theory promotes the classical Maxwell theory to a
non-linear electrodynamics with a larger symmetry structure (electromagnetic
duality plus conformal invariance), and provides dyonic BH solutions
characterized by both electric and magnetic charges modulated by the
nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism,
we derive the Hawking radiation spectrum and demonstrate how the Generalized
Uncertainty Principle (GUP) modifies the thermal emission, potentially leading
to stable remnants. Our analysis of gravitational lensing employs the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem to compute light deflection angles in both vacuum and
plasma environments, revealing strong dependencies on the ModMax parameter and
plasma density. We extend this to axion-plasmon environments, uncovering
frequency-dependent modifications that could serve as dark matter signatures.
The photon motion analysis in plasma media shows how the exponential damping
term $e^{-\gamma}$ affects electromagnetic backreaction on spacetime geometry.
We compute quantum-corrected thermodynamic quantities, including internal
energy, Helmholtz free energy, pressure, and heat capacity, using exponentially
modified entropy models. The heat capacity exhibits second-order phase
transitions with critical points shifting as functions of $\gamma$, indicating
rich thermodynamic phase structures. Energy condition analysis reveals
violations in near-horizon regions, characteristic of exotic matter supporting
these geometries.

### [21] [Reconciling Inflation with Hubble Anisotropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06796)
*Brett McInnes*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the isotropy of the Hubble field in cosmology. It presents a contradiction between inflationary models and observed anisotropy, suggesting that non-metric spacetime geometries, specifically those with torsion, might provide a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a long-standing issue in cosmology: the isotropy of the cosmic expansion. Despite inflationary models predicting isotropy, observed anisotropies present a challenge, prompting a theoretical exploration of alternative frameworks.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis, employing principles of general relativity and inflationary theory. They examine the constraints imposed by inflationary models on spacetime geometry and derive the implications of abandoning the strict metric assumption.

Result: The paper concludes that if spacetime is allowed to have torsion, it can accommodate observed anisotropies in the Hubble field without modifying inflation's initial conditions.

Conclusion: By introducing spacetime torsion, the model provides a natural explanation for Hubble anisotropies, aligning observations with inflationary predictions.

Abstract: There have been persistent suggestions, based on several diverse data sets,
that the cosmic expansion is not exactly isotropic. It is not easy to develop a
coherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard
General Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of
the very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm
basis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which
Inflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\,$ this, of course, includes the
vast majority of such theories -- $\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that
spacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is
completely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the
``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be
confirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from
the outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly
metric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far
the most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm
predictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the
degree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component
of the Hubble tension.

Method: 重新审视了模型独立分析方法，应用到新的数据集上，通过FLRW假设进行分析。

Result: 确认了宇宙加速膨胀，暗能量可能需要一种正压力，影响了现有模型的复杂性、cosmological原理或GR的有效性。

Conclusion: 暗能量的发现需要进一步研究，考虑到不同因素如数据解释、cosmological原理或GR的适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit/reinterpret/extend the model-independent analysis
method (which we now call spread - luminosity distance fitting, spread-LDF)
from our previous work. We apply it to the updated supernova type Ia catalogue,
Pantheon+ and recent GRB compilations. The procedure allows us, using only FLRW
assumption, to construct good approximations for expansion history of the
universe, re-confirming its acceleration to be a robust feature. When we also
assume General Relativity ("GR"), we can demonstrate, without any matter/energy
model in mind, the need for (possibly nonconstant) dark energy ("GDE"). We find
hints for positive pressure of GDE at z>1 with implications on either the
complexity of dark energy, or the validity of one of the cosmological
principle, interpretation of SN Ia data, or GR.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general
relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set
of simulated gravitational wave signals, including both general relativistic
and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power
spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo detectors at their designed
sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context
of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we
find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR,
even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to
simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is
effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using
numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show
that missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent
violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for
analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real
gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We
present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3,
finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is
$0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in
the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results
highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and
demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the
fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.

TL;DR: The paper suggests that black hole ringdowns exhibit nonlinear effects which produce gravitational waves from non-classical quantum states, making this potential for future quantum gravity detection despite practical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research aims to explore the quantum mechanical nature of gravity through black hole ringdowns, a manipulation of quantum states to detect gravitational waves.

Method: The authors describe analyzing quantum features of black hole ringdowns using methods from quantum optics, focusing on second harmonic generation and employing interferometric detectors for measurements despite coupling challenges.

Result: The paper proposes the possibility of using ringdown nonlinearities as quantum detectors for gravitational waves, suggesting a novel approach despite experimental challenges.

Conclusion: The research indicates that these nonlinear effects could generate detectable gravitational waves, offering a new avenue to study quantum gravity, though further theoretical and experimental work is needed.

Abstract: Is gravity quantum mechanical? If so, we argue that nonlinear effects in
black hole ringdowns - notably second harmonic generation - generates
gravitational waves in non-classical states. While quantum features of these
states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be
measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter
makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we
instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly
coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a
new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了带有电荷的Kalu-Ramond（KR）引力中旋转黑洞的阴影图像，使用了一个光学和几何上都薄的绕射盘作为光源模型。结果显示，与Sgr A*相比，M87*的观测数据对电荷参数Q和洛伦兹破坏参数G施加了更强的限制。在薄绕射盘模型下，观测者仰角较大的θ_o会将内阴影变形为帽状结构。参数（a, Q, G）主要影响内阴影的大小和临界曲线的亮度，增加这些参数会使阴影变小并增强临界曲线的可区分性。在反向绕射盘的情况下，引力红移显著降低了图像的观测亮度。此外，我们计算了投影屏幕上红移因子的分布。结果显示，大θ_o导致的相对论效应（比如蓝移）增强了图像的蓝移，而黑洞周围的粒子发射的光在内阴影附近产生了强烈的红移。最后，我们在同步辐射下研究了极化图像，发现极化强度P_o在其偏振图像和一阶图像中达到最大值，而内部阴影区域内没有极化向量。这些发现有助于深入理解带有电荷的黑洞在洛伦兹破坏引力中的阴影特性。

Result: 实验结果显示，与Sgr A*相比，M87*观测数据对电荷参数Q和洛伦兹破坏参数G施加了更强的约束。大角度θ_o会影响内阴影的形状和亮度，增加某些参数会减小阴影大小并增强临界曲线的可区分性。反向绕射盘情况下引力红移降低了图像亮度。在同步辐射下，极化强度P_o在其偏振图像和一阶图像中最大，内部阴影内无极化向量。

Conclusion: 该研究通过精确的数值模拟和理论分析，深入探讨了带有电荷的黑洞在洛伦兹破坏引力背景下的阴影图像特征，为理解此类黑洞的光学性质提供了重要的理论依据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the shadow images of rotating charged black holes in
Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, using an accretion disk that is both optically and
geometrically thin and located on the equatorial plane as the light source
model. The results show that, compared to Sgr A*, the observational data of
M87* impose stronger constraints on the charge parameter Q and the
Lorentz-violating parameter G. Under the thin accretion disk model, a larger
observer inclination theta_o deforms the inner shadow into a hat-like
structure. The parameters (a, Q, G) mainly affect the size of the inner shadow
and the brightness of the critical curve, where increasing these parameters
reduces the shadow size and enhances the distinguishability of the critical
curve. In the retrograde accretion disk case, the gravitational redshift
significantly reduces the observed brightness of the image. In addition, we
compute the distribution of the redshift factor on the projection screen. The
results indicate that the Doppler effect induced by large theta_o enhances the
blueshift in the image, while the light emitted by particles plunging into the
black hole leads to strong redshift near the inner shadow. Finally, we study
the polarization images under synchrotron radiation and find that the
polarization intensity P_o reaches its maximum around the lensed image and
higher-order images, whereas no polarization vectors appear within the inner
shadow. This stands in sharp contrast to horizonless compact objects. These
findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the shadow properties of
charged black holes within Lorentz-violating gravity.

quintessence fluid (QF). We analyze the dynamics of photons and test particles,
focusing on trajectories, photon spheres, BH shadows, and innermost stable
circular orbits (ISCO), highlighting how CoS and QF parameters affect these
features. We then examine the thermodynamic topology of the system by analyzing
vector field zeros, showing that varying CoS leads to distinct topological
configurations with total charges of either $0$ or $+1$, corresponding to known
classes like RN and AdS-RN. Additionally, we study scalar field dynamics via
the massless Klein-Gordon equation, reformulated into a
Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger-like form to derive the effective potential. We compute
the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar perturbations, showing how CoS and QF
influence oscillation frequencies and damping rates, with implications for
gravitational confinement and thermalization in the AdS/CFT context.

gravitational waves. In this study, we revisit the surface energy derivation
using a variational method that was recently used, and we recover the energy's
dependence on the compact binary's reduced mass, symmetric mass ratio, and the
normalized rotational speed at merger. For 31 out of 93 cataloged GW events
within the O1, O2 and O3 observation runs, we compute the anticipated energy
radiated as gravitational waves and compare these values with the observed
energy, either directly measured or extracted from the total-minus-remnant mass
difference. It is shown that the model presented in this work agrees well with
observed energy measurements, within the error range and via 1:1 ratios
spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ across 29 example events (the mean value of
these 29 ratios being $0.941$), with GW190403_051519 serving as an outlier with
the 1:1 ratio of $0.462$, demonstrating the precision and universality of the
energy expression to be applied to current and future detections.

Abstract: At the quantum level, the polynomial models of gravity with six and eight
derivatives are superrenormalizable, but suffer from higher derivative ghost
and/or tachyonic ghost states. On the other hand, these models may have
advantages in the control of negative effects of ghosts, compared to the more
common fourth-derivative theory. We explore the positiveness of energy of the
individual plane wave solutions in the general models with six and eight
derivatives. Different from the fourth-order gravity, the part of the energy
which may be seen as the leading one in the UV, is positively defined in the
tensor sector. We extend this investigation to the scalar sectors of the free
theory.

Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in
the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the
equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact
solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is
embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known
McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends
on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with
the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or
during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the
supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes
suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the
cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters
the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour
of black holes around different future singularities are carefully
investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the
tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended
object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside
the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the
spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon,
it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the
radius of the singularity becomes infinite.

Conclusion: 量子毛不仅改变黑洞几何，还显著影响其强性引力透镜效应的观测指标。

Abstract: According to the no-hair theorem, stationary black holes are uniquely
characterized by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. In this paper, we
explore quantum hair by deriving the quantum-corrected black hole metric within
the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky formalism. The quantum-corrected metric is obtained
perturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity
between the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal
Gauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this
metric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute
the associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular
separation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum
hair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the
nonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong
deflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the
angular separation decreases. In addition, the role of quantum hair is
discussed in the weak and strong naked singularities. As a result, we
demonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but
also its strong gravitational lensing effects.

### [31] [Interior instability of naked singularities of a scalar field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07655)
*Junbin Li*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the instability of naked singularities in the Einstein-Scalar field system and their potential to form black holes under certain perturbations, contributing to the understanding of cosmic censorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the cosmic censorship hypothesis, which suggests that singularities are always surrounded by event horizons, and this study provides insights into whether naked singularities can form without being hidden.

Method: The authors analyze the instability by perturbing the solutions with specific characteristics, considering different regions (interior and exterior) and varying null cones, demonstrating both interior and exterior instability under certain conditions.

Result: The study shows that naked singularities are unstable under certain perturbations and supports weak cosmic censorship in this model by suggesting black hole formation instead of leaving a naked singularity.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to understanding the conditions under which naked singularities might be converted into black holes, supporting the idea of cosmic censorship by preventing their existence in the absence of surrounding horizons.

Abstract: We show that the $k$-self-similar naked singularity solutions of the
spherically symmetric Einstein--Scalar field system are unstable to black hole
formation under perturbations that are totally supported in the interior
region, in all regularities strictly below the threshold. The instability below
the threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that
general naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV
perturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic
censorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on
the exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface
formation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel
approach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming
null cones becoming more and more singular.

Conclusion: 加速和减速阶段探测器表现出良好的可除性，其相关性度量在经历加速或减速阶段后平滑恢复到初始状态。

Abstract: We construct a smooth trajectory in Minkowski spacetime that is inertial in
the asymptotic past and future but undergoes approximately uniform acceleration
for a finite duration. In a suitable limit, this trajectory reduces to the
standard Rindler trajectory, reproducing the expected Bogoliubov
transformations and results consistent with the thermal time hypothesis. We
analyze the behavior of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector following such a
trajectory and explore the dependence of complete positivity (CP) divisibility
on the detector's frequency, acceleration, and the duration of acceleration.
Notably, we find that the detector exhibits a memory effect due to the finite
duration of acceleration, which is also quantified by the Fisher information.
We further examine two UDW detectors along various trajectory combinations and
show that, unlike the transition rate, both the total correlation and the
entanglement harvested return smoothly to their initial values after the
acceleration/deceleration phase. These correlation measures behave similarly in
both accelerating and decelerating segments. Interestingly, negativity and
mutual information remain unaffected by the memory effect. We also discuss the
physical significance of the sign of the flux of acceleration-induced
radiation.

Abstract: We study the thermodynamic phase transition of ModMax anti-de Sitter (AdS)
black holes using Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in
unstable circular orbits. Our results demonstrate that the thermal profile of
the Lyapunov exponent serves as an efficient probe of the black hole's phase
structure. We calculate the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent across the
transition and show that it acts as an order parameter, exhibiting a critical
exponent $\delta=1/2$ in the vicinity of the critical point. Furthermore, we
explore the violation of the chaos bound, finding that the bound is violated
when the horizon radius falls below a threshold value. We also examine how the
ModMax parameter and the particle's angular momentum modify this threshold,
revealing their role in controlling the onset of chaos bound violation.

Abstract: The five-dimensional loop quantum Kaluza-Klein cosmology is constructed based
on the symmetric reduction of the connection formulation of the full theory.
Through semiclassical analysis, the effective scalar constraint for the
cosmological model coupled with a dust field is derived, incorporating the
quantum fluctuations of geometry as a subleading order correction. It
demonstrates that the quantum model has the correct classical limit. The
explicit solutions to the equations of motion show that the classical big bang
and past big rip singularities in the classical model are avoided by a quantum
bounce and a quantum collapse respectively in the effective model. In a
particular scenario, the dynamical compactification of the extra dimension is
realized, while the observable four-dimensional universe transitions through
three distinct epochs: (i) a super-inflationary phase generating 55 e-folds
with particular choices of the initial value, (ii) a decelerated expansion era,
and (iii) a late-time accelerated expansion phase driven by quantum
fluctuations. These results suggest that both cosmic inflation and dark energy
may originate from the interplay between the compactified extra dimension and
quantum geometric effects.

TL;DR: The paper examines the irreversibility in systems with event horizons, linking quantum tunneling to entropy fluctuations. It uses three examples to illustrate this connection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of quantum tunneling in entropy fluctuations is crucial as entropy is key to understanding irreversibility in thermodynamics.

Method: The paper uses three examples of entropy variance under different conditions: quantum fluctuations for black hole horizons, thermal fluctuations for the Hubble volume in de Sitter state, and Poisson distribution for Planckon model.

Result: The paper shows that entropy variance and event horizons are connected through quantum and thermal fluctuations, highlighting the role of tunneling in thermodynamic processes.

Conclusion: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, with quantum tunneling playing a central role in determining thermodynamic properties such as entropy and fluctuations.

Abstract: The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical
irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no
difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of
quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their
temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of
entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area
of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations;
(ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state,
obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of
entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson
distribution.

Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view
and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon
where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be
effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime.
Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement
compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the
family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and
T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic
and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the
emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific
materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined
approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can
be used for other materials families to build a materials database for
radiative heat transfer.

Abstract: Inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnets (AFMs) with odd-parity
spin-polarization pattern have been proposed as a new venue for spintronics.
These AFMs require commensurate ordering to ensure an effective time-reversal
symmetry, which guarantees a strictly antisymmetric spin polarization of the
electronic states. Recently, nonsymmorphic centrosymmetric crystals have been
identified as a broad class of materials which could exhibit unit-cell doubling
magnetism with odd-parity spin-polarization. Here we investigate the stability
of these states against incommensuration. We first demonstrate that the
symmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit
the existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological
Ginzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate
ordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave
spin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they
have an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity
spin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off
the time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin
fluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the
effect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and
find that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments.
However, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new
mechanism for driving incommensuration. Our results imply that odd-parity AFMs
are likely to be preceded by an incommensurate phase, or emerge directly from
the normal state via a first order transition. These conclusions are consistent
with the phase diagram of several candidate materials.

Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order
parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence
linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density,
giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the
interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a
spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which
functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes
nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by
spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling
the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response
via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of
ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discovers the first experimental realization of anomalous Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators and their topological interface modes, contributing to the understanding of Floquet-driven topological phases. They constructed a 1D three-band model and observed multifold bulk-edge correspondence in acoustics. The results offer new avenues for non-equilibrium topological physics studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Abelian topological phases beyond traditional Abelian theories are attracting significant attention, this paper contributes by demonstrating the first experimental realization of anomalous Floquet topological insulators, which opens up new possibilities in understanding non-equilibrium topological phases and offers experimental avenues for further exploration.

Method: They constructed a one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and integrated time-periodic coupling circuits with static acoustic crystals. They observed counterintuitive topological interface modes through experiments in acoustics. Both bulk-edge correspondence and the unusual interface modes were verified.

Result: Anomalous Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNTIs) were experimentally realized, demonstrating topological edge modes in multiple gaps. Bulk-edge correspondence was observed. Counterintuitive topological interface modes in domain walls were observed in the first Floquet model analog, and previous edge states were obstructed in the counterpart. Both the three-fold bulk-edge correspondence and these modes were unattainable in Floquet Abelian systems. Additionally, the field opens up new avenues for expanding and exploring non-equilibrium topological phases.

Conclusion: This work provides a concrete foundation for exploring the physics of Floquet-driven topological phases. Moreover, it opens a new branch of topological physics and provides a new platform for further experimental exploration of non-equilibrium topological phases, potentially offering interesting future directions for this research field.

Abstract: Non-Abelian topological phases, which go beyond traditional Abelian
topological band theory, are garnering increasing attention. This is further
spurred by periodic driving, leading to predictions of many novel multi-gap
Floquet topological phases, including anomalous Euler and Dirac string phases
induced by non-Abelian Floquet braiding, as well as Floquet non-Abelian
topological insulators (FNTIs) that exhibit multifold bulk-edge correspondence.
Here, we report the first experimental realization of anomalous FNTIs, which
demonstrate topological edge modes in all three gaps despite having a trivial
bulk charge. Concretely, we construct an experimentally feasible
one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and implement it in acoustics by
integrating time-periodic coupling circuits to static acoustic crystals.
Furthermore, we observe counterintuitive topological interface modes in the
domain-wall formed by an anomalous FNTI and its counterpart with swapped
driving sequences, modes previously inaccessible in Floquet Abelian systems.
Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration of the uncharted
non-equilibrium topological physics.

*Bozhen Zhou,Pan Zhang,Yucheng Wang,Chao Yang*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper studies conductance in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with gain and loss, showing half-quantized conductance in the topologically nontrivial phase. The results highlight the role of dissipation in enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the transport properties of topological systems with gain and loss, which is important for understanding how dissipation affects topology in quantum systems.

Method: The authors analyze the model using analytical methods and demonstrate half-quantization using Lindblad equations and coherent population transfer (CPT).

Result: The conductance becomes half-integer in the nontrivial phase due to gain/loss. The half-quantization arises primarily from dissipation through gain/loss and edge states.

Conclusion: This work introduces a new mechanism for topological transport in 1D systems and shows how dissipation enables topological signatures in open quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantized conductance from topologically protected edge states is a hallmark
of two-dimensional topological phases. In contrast, edge states in
one-dimensional (1D) topological systems cannot transmit current across the
insulating bulk, rendering their topological nature invisible in transport. In
this work, we investigate the transport properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model with gain and loss, and show that the zero-energy conductance exhibits
qualitatively distinct behaviors between the topologically trivial and
nontrivial phases, depending on the hybridization and dissipation strengths.
Crucially, we analytically demonstrate that the conductance can become
half-quantized in the topologically nontrivial phase, a feature absent in the
trivial phase. We further show that the half quantization predominantly
originates from transport channels involving gain/loss and edge states. Our
results uncover a new mechanism for realizing quantized transport in 1D
topological systems and highlight the nontrivial role of dissipation in
enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.

### [41] [Randomly twisted bilayer graphene -- the cascade transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07024)
*Baruch Horovitz,Pierre Le Doussal*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: TBG with disorder in twist angle leads to extreme Dirac velocity reduction, causing DOS divergence, which implies electrons pile near zero energy. Disorder AO affects Coulomb interactions, and Hartree-Fock shows chemical potential jumps at integer fillings, leading to transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the effects of disorder on twisted bilayer graphene's electronic properties, which is crucial for understanding potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices.

Method: The research employs theoretical models, specifically Dirac equation with random gauge potentials and-disordered environments, and uses methods like Hartree-Fock to analyze the effects.

Result: The findings reveal that disorder enhances extreme electronic effects in TBG, with diverging DOS and significant implications for device functionality.

Conclusion: The study concludes that TBG's electronic behavior is significantly influenced by disorder, which could impact its use in practical electronic applications.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known to have disorder in its twist angle.
We show that in terms of a Dirac equation with a random gauge potential ${\bf
A}({\bf r})$ this disorder becomes huge when the average twist angle is near
the magic angle where the Dirac velocity vanishes. The density of states (DOS)
then diverges at the Dirac point as $\rho(E)\sim E^{(2/z)-1}$ with $z\gg 1$ and
we deduce that all electrons occupy energies very near $E=0$. We prove a sum
rule on the disorder averaged eigenfunctions from which we deduce that each
added electron contributes equal intraband Coulomb interaction energy. The
various bands in TBG are related by either ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow {\bf
A}({-\bf r})$ or ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow -{\bf A}({\bf r})$ which affects
the interband interaction energy. We find, within Hartree-Fock, jumps in the
chemical potential at each integer filling, accounting for the cascade
transitions.

*Toshihito Osada*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates topological features in α-type layered organic conductors, specifically looking at 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetals and topological insulators. It uses Wannier charge centers as a framework to identify topological states. The study suggests that type-I Dirac semimetal is crucial for explaining chiral transport, while weak TI is consistently observed. The strong TI appears uncertain due to experimental constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the topological states of materials is crucial for both fundamental physics and potential applications in electronics and quantum computing. This paper focuses on α-type layered organic conductors, aiming to identify their topological features using a Wannier-based approach, which is gaining attention for insights into unconventional topological phases.

Method: The research employs a Wannier charge center framework to analyze the electronic structure of multilayered α-(ET)2I3 and α-(BETS)2I3. They examine Dirac/Weyl semimetal states induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking to identify topological states such as type-I Dirac semimetal and weak TI. The strong TI's consistency with experiments is questioned, suggesting it might not be realizable.

Result: The study finds that interlayer spin-orbit coupling and layering significantly influence the topological states. In α-(ET)2I3, type-I Dirac semimetal explains chiral transport phenomena, while in α-(BETS)2I3, a strong weak TI emerges. However, the strong TI is unlikely due to experimental constraints and material-specific factors.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework using WCCs to predict and identify topological states in α-type layered conductors. The results suggest that type-I Dirac semimetal and weak TI are robust, while the potential for strong TI remains uncertain.

Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type
layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on
Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological
states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered
\alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer
spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral
transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates
from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3,
a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective
of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The
strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be
realized.

### [43] [Magnetic Moment vs Angular Momentum: Spin Hall Response in Bismuth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07200)
*Junji Fujimoto,Yuki Izaki,Yuki Fuseya*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Spin currents in Bi can carry either spin angular momentum or magnetic moment, which are not strictly proportional. Computations show that the magnetic-moment tensor is much larger and less anisotropic than the angular momentum tensor, with damping effects adding longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity, indicating a need to distinguish between the two types of currents in multiband systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses spin currents in multiband systems, specifically in Bi, which introduces a new aspect to the understanding of spin Hall conductivity by considering magnetic moments instead of just angular momentum.

Method: A multiband kp model is used to compute the spin Hall conductivity tensors for Bi, analyzing differences between the magnetic-moment and angular-momentum tensors, considering quasiparticle damping.

Result: The magnetic-moment tensor is significantly larger and less anisotropic compared to the angular-momentum tensor. The spin Hall angle for magnetic-moment exceeds unity, while the angular-momentum angle is less than 1. Damping effects lead to longitudinal components in both tensors.

Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of distinguishing between spin angular momentum and magnetic moment in multiband systems, as the magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeding unity disproves the traditional assumption that spin Hall conductivity requires reciprocal coefficients, necessitating this distinction for accurate modeling.

Abstract: Spin currents can carry either spin angular momentum or its associated
magnetic moment, which are no longer strictly proportional in multiband
systems. Using a multiband $k \cdot p$ model, we compute the intrinsic spin
Hall conductivity tensors of elemental Bi. The magnetic-moment tensor emerges
about two orders of magnitude larger and far less anisotropic than the
angular-momentum tensor, while quasiparticle damping activates otherwise
longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity,
demonstrating that a clear distinction between the two currents is
indispensable for multiband systems.

### [44] [Conical Intersections Shed Light on Hot Carrier Cooling in Quantum Dots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07322)
*Caitlin V. Hetherington,Nila Mohan T. M.,Shanu A. Shameem,Warren F. Beck,Benjamin G. Levine*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper explores how different ligands on colloidal semiconducting quantum dots affect the vibronic coherences observed through spectroscopy, showing that the mechanism of hot carrier relaxation can be generalized using a cascade of conical intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying ultrafast relaxation of excited states in quantum dots is crucial for understanding materials used in optoelectronic applications, aiming to optimize their performance by controlling disorder mechanisms.

Method: The authors used broadband multidimensional spectroscopy to observe vibronic coherences arising from conical intersections in QDs with different ligands.

Result: Carboxylate ligands allow for a generalized electron coupling mechanism, but with less prominence compared to amine ligands. Truncating ligand chains affects the relaxation mechanism.

Conclusion: The findings extend the understanding of ultrafast dynamics in QDs, highlighting the role of ligands in modifying relaxation pathways beyond just reducing electron hopping. This suggests potential design strategies for optimizing optoelectronic devices by engineering ligand properties.

Abstract: Experimental observations of vibronic coherences in electronically excited
colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals offer a window into the ultrafast dynamics
of hot carrier cooling. In previous work, we showed that, in amine-passivated
quantum dots (QDs), these coherences arise during relaxation through a cascade
of conical intersections between electronically excited states. Here, we
demonstrate the generality of this framework by application to QDs with
surface-bound carboxylate ligands. A model involving a similar cascade of
conical intersections accurately reproduces the frequencies of vibronic
coherences observed with broadband multidimensional spectroscopy. The impact of
ligands on the relaxation dynamics is attributed to two distinct mechanisms
involving either electronic or vibrational coupling between the core and
ligands. Compared to the amine-passivated QDs studied previously, the
electronic coupling mechanism is less prominent in carboxylate-passivated QDs.
Furthermore, comparison of acetate and formate ligands reveals that truncating
the ligand alkyl chains alters the relaxation behavior predicted by the model.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the quantum metric dipole tuning in nonmagnetic materials to induce nonlinear magnetotransport effects, specifically in Cd3As2, using a combination of experiments and effective model analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether the quantum metric dipole can induce nonlinear Hall effects in nonmagnetic systems, expanding the potential applications in nonlinear magnetotransport.

Method: They used experiments in Cd3As2 with strong magnetic fields and developed a k.p model incorporating the Zeeman and orbital coupling to explain the phenomena.

Result: A time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall effect was observed alongside the usual longitudinal magnetoresistance, tunable by the magnetic field.

Conclusion: This opens a new strategy for engineering quantum effects in nonmagnetic materials using quantum metrics.

Abstract: The quantum geometry, comprising Berry curvature and quantum metric, plays a
fundamental role in governing electron transport phenomena in solids. Recent
studies show that the quantum metric dipole drives scattering-free nonlinear
Hall effect in topological antiferromagnets, prompting the questions of whether
this effect can occur in nonmagnetic systems and be externally tuned by a
magnetic field. Our work addresses these frontiers by demonstrating that the
quantum metric dipole is actively tuned by an external magnetic field to
generate a time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall response in a nonmagnetic
topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Alongside the well-known
chiral-anomaly-induced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, an exotic
nonlinear planar Hall effect emerges with increasing magnetic field. Careful
scaling analysis indicates that this nonlinear planar Hall effect is controlled
by the magnetic-field-modulated quantum metric dipole. Constructing a k.p
effective model of the Dirac bands under Zeeman and orbital coupling, we derive
the evolution of the quantum metric dipole as a function of the magnetic field,
providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental results. Our results
establish a band-structure-based strategy for engineering nonlinear
magnetotransport in nonmagnetic materials via the quantum metric dipole,
opening a pathway toward magnetic-field-tunable nonlinear quantum devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thermal Scanning-Probe Lithography (tSPL) to create detailed topographical landscapes in van der Waals heterostructures, enabling precise control over the geometry of two-dimensional materials like graphene and hBN. This technique allows for customization of charge carrier doping by creating an electric field gradient, which is demonstrated through successful transport measurements and oscillations in resistance peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of 2D materials has seen a focus on their controlled synthesis and integration into functional devices. Current lithography methods are limited to specific in-plane patterns, restricting more complex architectures. There's a clear need for a more versatile patterning technique that can create detailed topographies and control the structural properties of these materials at the nanoscale.

Method: The authors employ Thermal Scanning-Probe Lithography (tSPL), which allows for the creation of smooth, topographic landscapes with nanometer precision. The technique enables the modulation of the graphene layer's thickness and geometric shape by applying electric fields using tSPL-patterned gates. The paper describes the implementation of sinusoidal topography and its effect on charge carrier doping through an electric field gradient, as well as the subsequent transport measurements demonstrating the success of this method.

Result: Successful demonstration of tSPL's ability to create high-quality, topographically textured van der Waals heterostructures. The use of sinusoidal patterns modulates the electric field gradient, leading to commensurability oscillations in resistance, which are observed experimentally. This validates tSPL as a precise and versatile tool for controlling the geometry and properties of 2D materials.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking technique in 2D materials research, expanding the possibilities for designing complex and functional electronic devices by enabling precise topographical control. The application of tSPL in vdW heterostructures marks a significant step forward in overcoming the limitations of conventional lithography methods, paving the way for advanced applications in quantum electronics and nanoscale device development.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments
generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a
protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate
properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices,
heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching,
which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are
primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes,
limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal
scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in
vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with
nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an
electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate
charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport
measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability
oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.

Abstract: Moir\'e flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for
exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band
often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with
internal symmetries such as SU($N$) have so far been realized only in highly
engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern
band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in
rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN
substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase
diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and
analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry
breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. Our findings unveil a new
class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from
quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.

Abstract: Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum
interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall
regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n
junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against
decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for
graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations.
We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate
potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor
scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The
resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are
efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which
yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional
signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the
asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference
visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Raman scattering response of CoPS3 under varying magnetic field and temperature. They identify hybrid magnon-phonon excitations and determine their energies, magnon-phonon coupling strengths, and propose new material parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between magnetic interactions and vibrational modes in CoPS3 is important for advancing our knowledge of antiferromagnetic materials and their properties under varying external conditions.

Method: Raman scattering and magnetic measurements were used to study the material's response. They likely analyzed the peaks to identify excitation modes and measured how these modes change with magnetic field and temperature.

Result: The material shows two phonon-like modes at specific wavenumbers. The magnon-phonon interaction is significant and can explain their splitting. They determined the effective exchange energy and magnetic anisotropy parameters, as well as an anisotropic g-factor which explains the observed splitting.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the understanding of how magnetic interactions influence vibrational modes in CoPS3, providing new material parameters that account for the observed splitting in Raman spectra.

Abstract: The Raman scattering response of the biaxial antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ has
been investigated as a function of both magnetic field and temperature. The
peaks observed in the low-frequency spectral range (90--200~cm$^{-1}$) have
been identified as hybrid magnon--phonon excitations. The energies of the bare
magnon and phonon modes, as well as the effective coupling strengths between
different excitation pairs, have been determined. The strong and selective
magnon--phonon interaction largely accounts for the pronounced splitting of two
phonon-like modes observed at 152~cm$^{-1}$ and 158~cm$^{-1}$ in the
antiferromagnetic phase of CoPS$_3$. Based on the identification of bare magnon
excitations and their magnetic-field dependence, we propose an updated set of
parameters for the effective exchange ($J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 9.9$~meV) and
biaxial magnetic anisotropy ($D = 4.3$~meV and $E = -0.7$~meV) and advocate for
an apparent anisotropic $g$-factor ($g_x = g_y = 2$, $g_z = 4$) in the CoPS$_3$
antiferromagnet.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper examines the ErSbTe material family as a nodal line semimetal candidate. Using ARPES and first-principles calculations, they found that ErSbTe exhibits a diamond-shaped Fermi surface with nodal features, identified by gapless bands crossing the Fermi level along specific symmetry directions. The material shows paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic transitions around 1.94 K and 1.75 K, with specific resistivity anomalies at these temperatures. The electronic structure suggests the influence of Er's symmetry on band degeneracy, and the absence of a characteristic resistivity feature compared to other similar materials indicates unique properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of compound semimetals is crucial for understanding novel electronic phenomena, such as nodal lines and phase transitions, which can lead to applications in next-generation electronics and quantum computing. ErSbTe is part of a family of materials with rich magnetic and electronic properties, making it an interesting candidate for such research.

Method: The paper uses a combination of experimental techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy) and computational modeling (first-principles band structure calculations) to analyze the electronic and thermodynamic properties of ErSbTe. They considered the effects of spin-orbit coupling in their theoretical analysis, which is vital for understanding the material's electronic structure, especially around nodal points.

Result: The findings highlight the presence of a nodal line semimetal behavior in ErSbTe with a diamond-shaped Fermi surface. The material exhibits paramagnetic phases at low temperatures, indicating a change in magnetic ordering as the temperature decreases. The resistivity measurements show anomalies around 1.94 K and 1.75 K, suggesting temperature-dependent magnetic ordering or phase transitions. The electron band structure indicates nodal features crossing the Fermi level, influenced by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the material, which are critical for understanding its electronic behavior under different conditions.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the understanding of the electronic and thermodynamic properties of ErSbTe, a nodal line semimetal. The diamond-shaped Fermi surface with nodal features, combined with the observed phase transitions, suggests that ErSbTe has unique electronic properties that could be explored further. Its distinct behavior compared to other LnSbTe materials makes it a valuable candidate for future research in semimetal physics and materials science applications.

Abstract: The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing
characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f
electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper,
we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties
and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using
angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first
principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without
considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy
which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent
susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements,
coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition
approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field
cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like
feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe,
exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX,
electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by
the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this
direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its
maximum along the GM direction.

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted considerable attention and undergone
extensive investigation in recent years. However, theoretical studies
addressing size-dependent effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
establish a unified semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport
equation, incorporating generalized boundary conditions to bridge the ballistic
and diffusive transport regimes. Our analysis reveals that the nonlinear Hall
effect arises from the combined action of two distinct mechanisms: the Berry
curvature dipole and the Fermi-surface integral of Berry curvature.
Furthermore, we investigate the Hall effect in topological crystalline
insulators (TCIs), elucidating that the size dependence originates from
competition between the two transport mechanisms. By connecting the two
distinct regimes, our theoretical framework provides a comprehensive
understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect in finite-sized systems, offering
both fundamental insights and a useful analytical tool for more size-dependent
investigations.

Motivation: Understanding thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is crucial for material development, aiming to tailor thermal properties for various applications.

Method: The authors used ab-initio density functional theory to calculate binding energies and developed an interlayer potential, then used it to model interfacial thermal conductivity and phonon density of states analysis.

Result: Strain significantly enhances (136%) and suppresses (70%) thermal conductance. Phonon density of states show blueshift with compressive strain and redshift with tensile strain, positively correlating thermal conductance with temperature and interaction strength.

Conclusion: External strain effectively controls and enhances interfacial thermal conductance in van der Waals heterostructures, providing a promising avenue for thermal management in material design.

Abstract: Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals
heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer
interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for
graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy
obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to
calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that
the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external
strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the
phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat
flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the
unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite
effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value.
Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both
temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the
interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.

Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into
account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a
simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based
on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing
the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift
retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's
vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift
arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice.
The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin,
retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi
velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between
spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.

Abstract: As integrated circuits continue to scale down and adopt three-dimensional
(3D) stacking, thermal management in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) has emerged as
a critical design constraint. In this study, we present a combined experimental
and simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically
understand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed
Source (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure
cross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips
at nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6
interconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct
multilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model,
while areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the
underlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using
COMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric
thermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations
reveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the
primary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure
plays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation
approach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC
architectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in
future high-performance 3D-stacked devices.

Abstract: Quantum Wells (QW) are of great importance in optoelectronic devices such as
LEDs and LASERs, being the emissive layers.Simulating the quantum particles in
different QW topologies like rectangular finite potential wells, multiple
potential wells, and triangular biased potential well heterojunctions enables
faster modeling, theoretical characterization, and more. QVNTVS performs energy
level and wavefunction calculations, recombination probability, transition
energy, and optical emission computations quickly and accurately. Contrasting
with the existing simulators, QVNTVS is an open-source project and can produce
solutions for niche problems like potential wells under an electric field,
heterojunctions, recombination, and transition matrices. QVNTVS simulates QWs
by solving the Time-Independent Schr\"odinger Equation for different potential
profiles in a discretized space using the finite-difference method and computes
the properties of the device using the extracted information from the solution.
The results align with the analytical calculations and the experimental data.

Abstract: Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics,
combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows
for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of
SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to
address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other
two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable
spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in
next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to
the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for
both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for
in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the
unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$
interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the
conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the
bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a
wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.

Method: The researchers used semiconductor optical amplifiers or quantum dot SOAs, applying short resonant pulses to induce Rabi oscillations. They likely measured noise levels to observe squeezing effects.

Result: They achieved 

Conclusion: Quasi-squeezing via coherent effects in SOAs requires careful control of pulse parameters to avoid quantum noise, suggesting potential applications in quantum communication systems.

Abstract: Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or
\c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also
offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add
amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing
to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity
and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to
squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but
often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier.
At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a
quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we
demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise
squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise
in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this
condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when
the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the
pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In
all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.

Motivation: The paper focuses on improving the detection of quantum dot properties through noise analysis and noise estimation.

Method: The authors analyzed noise characteristics, developed noise estimators, optimized them, and evaluated their performance using simulated data.

Result: The estimator from Chen et al. performed best, showing minimal scattering and suitability for the application.

Conclusion: The optimal operating regime for quantum dot sensors can be accurately determined using a suitable noise estimator, with the Chen estimator being the most effective.

Abstract: In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of
electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum
dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally
sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance
measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to
tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze
the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to
identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio.
Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal
operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators,
modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality
based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best
suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results.
Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest
classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our
approach.

Abstract: Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum
computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by
fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the
appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by
analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation
algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and
manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new
approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible
framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with
appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation
to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom
models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust,
technology-independent algorithms. Code is available at

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter
space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the
system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various
platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems -
such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this
gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter
modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems
can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach
enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum
states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.

Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a
fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale
experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium
dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general
extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing
potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed
different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking
and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we
observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional
U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we
demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string
fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering
processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes.
Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon
quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an
extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order
correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly
correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions
between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing
non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying
far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.

Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole
compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional
Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the
uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model,
while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous
predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which
yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating
signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore,
we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature
phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature
increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value
characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This
crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above
which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains
the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing
open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where
integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal
intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations,
dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic,
nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar
anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.

Abstract: Cluster synchronization in multilayer networks of phase oscillators with
phase-lag poses significant challenges due to the destabilizing effects of
delayed interactions. Leveraging the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model, this study
addresses these challenges by systematically exploring the role of natural
frequency distributions in sustaining cluster synchronization under high
phase-lag conditions. We focus on four distributions: uniform (uni-uni),
partially degree-correlated (deg-uni, uni-deg), and fully degree-correlated
(deg-deg), where oscillators' intrinsic frequencies align with their network
connectivity. Through numerical and analytical investigations, we demonstrate
that the deg-deg distribution, where both layers employ degree-matched
frequencies, remarkably enhances synchronization stability, outperforming other
configurations. We analyze two distinct network architectures: one composed
entirely of nontrivial clusters and another combining trivial and nontrivial
clusters. Results reveal that structural heterogeneity encoded in the deg-deg
coupling counteracts phase-lag-induced desynchronization, enabling robust
cluster synchronization even at large phase-lag values. Stability is rigorously
validated via transverse Lyapunov exponents (TLEs), which confirm that deg-deg
networks exhibit broader synchronization regimes compared to uniform or
partially correlated systems. These findings provide critical insights into the
interplay between topological heterogeneity and dynamical resilience, offering
a framework for designing robust multilayer systems from delay-tolerant power
grids to adaptive biological networks, where synchronization under phase-lag is
paramount.

Abstract: The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab will deliver a
high-intensity, multi-megawatt neutrino beam to the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE), enabling precision tests of the three-neutrino paradigm, CP
violation searches, neutrino mass ordering determination, and supernova
neutrino studies. In order to accelerate DUNE's physics reach and ensure robust
beam operations, we propose an integrated AI-driven framework with real-time
diagnostics and radiation-hardened instrumentation. A physics-informed digital
twin is at the heart of this Real-Time Beam Integrity Monitor. By
reconstructing pion phase space from muon profiles and exploiting magnetic horn
optic linearity, it enables spill-by-spill beam correction and flux
stabilization. By using this approach, flux-related systematics could be
reduced from 5\% to 1\%, potentially accelerating the discovery of CP
violations by four to six years. Complementing this, a US-Japan R\&D effort
will deploy a LGAD-based muon monitor in the NuMI beamline. Time of Flight
(ToF) measurements can be acquired with picosecond precision using this
radiation-hard system, enhancing sensitivity to horn chromatic effects.
Simulations confirm strong responses to these effects. Machine learning models
can predict beam quality and horn current with sub-percent accuracy. This
scalable, AI-enabled strategy improves beam fidelity and reduces systematics,
transforming high-power accelerator operations.

Abstract: Slow positrons are increasingly important to the study of material surfaces.
For these kinds of studies, the positrons must have low emittance and
relatively high brightness. Unfortunately, fast positron sources like
radioactive capsules or linac driven sources have broad energy and angular
spread, which make them difficult to capture and use. Moderators are materials
that produce slow, mono-energetic positrons from a fast positron beam. Since
their efficiencies are typically less than $10^{-3}$ slow $e^+$ per fast $e^+$,
research into how to maximize efficiency is of great interest. Previous work
has shown that using a linac, one can decelerate the fast positron beam in
order to greatly increase moderation efficiency. We present here start-to-end
simulations using G4beamline to model a 100 MeV electron beam incident upon a
Tungsten target, focused by an adiabatic matching device, and decelerated by a
1.3 GHz, 5-cell pillbox cavity. We show that by decelerating the positrons
after their creation we can increase the number of positrons under 500 keV by
15 times, translating to a 16.3 times improvement in moderation efficiency, and
therefore leading to a brighter positron source.

speed control performance of DC servo motors, which are widely used in
industrial applications such as robotics and CNC. The objective of the proposed
controller is to enhance the speed control performance of DC servo motors on
the CE110 Servo Trainer. The proposed method integrates a traditional PID
controller with a sliding mode control mechanism to effectively handle system
uncertainties and disturbances. Experimental results show that the SMC-PID
method provides significant improvements in accuracy and stability compared to
traditional PID controllers, with metrics such as reduced overshoot, shorter
settling time, and increased adaptability to system uncertainties. This
research highlights the effectiveness of the SMC-PID controller, enhancing the
performance of DC servo motor speed control.

### [69] [Comment on "Unifying Aspects of Generalized Calculus"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06596)
*Mikołaj Sienicki,Krzysztof Sienicki*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Czachor's non-Newtonian calculus faces conceptual issues in physics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the feasibility of extending calculus to non-Newtonian systems for scientific applications.

Method: Abstract analysis using mathematical bijections and physical scrutiny.

Result: The framework fails due to problematic bijections and lacks predictive power in physical contexts.

Conclusion: Rejection of Czachor's approach for physical theories with insufficient foundational coherence.

Abstract: Czachor's recent proposal introduces a form of non-Newtonian calculus built
by pulling back arithmetic operations through arbitrary bijections between
continua. Although the idea is mathematically inventive, it runs into serious
conceptual trouble when examined from a physical standpoint. Claims of
universal applicability quickly unravel under scrutiny -- especially when
considering pathological bijections like the Cantor function, which break the
framework's core assumptions. When applied to domains such as relativity,
entropy, or cosmology, the results often collapse into tautological
restatements lacking real predictive power. This commentary explores these
issues in depth, highlighting where and why the formalism falls short of
providing a physically coherent theory.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum
many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed
balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of
matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning
agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in
(1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that,
above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are
non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to
area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks
that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement
distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum
accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of
equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned
behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work
establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven
individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom,
demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and
uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.

$Ax=b$, given the input state $|b\rangle$, is envisaged to have diverse
applications. In this paper, we substantially simplify the algorithm,
originally formed of a complex sequence of phase estimations, amplitude
amplifications and Hamiltonian simulations, by replacing the phase estimations
with a continuous time quantum walk. The key technique is the use of weak
couplings to access the matrix inversion embedded in perturbation theory.

Abstract: Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling
open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise
noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum
control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental
noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical
modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an
effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise
sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the
system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness
against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state
transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($>\!99\%$) across
diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared
to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between
theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a
hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across
platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state
qubits.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper discusses improvements to Josephson mixers to handle frequency multiplexed signals effectively, with enhanced bandwidth and power capabilities. They achieved high power reflections and saturation powers through optimized design strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researchers aim to enhance the capabilities of Josephson mixers, which are crucial for quantum signal processing, by addressing their limitations in processing multiplexed signals. This is essential for scalability in large quantum systems.

Method:  The authors optimized the JRM's inductances to suppress higher order mixing and engineered its EM environment with coupled-mode networks. These strategies were used to design mixers with improved performance metrics like bandwidth and power handling.

Result:  The optimized JMs showed enhanced performance with bandwidths of 400-700 MHz and high power reflections. They demonstrated applications in qubit readout, routing, and entanglement generation.

Conclusion:  The redesigned Josephson mixers overcome bandwidth and power limitations, making them suitable for frequency multiplexed quantum signal processing tasks, supporting scalability in quantum computing and communications.

Abstract: Nondegenerate Josephson mixers (JMs), formed by coupling two different
transmission-line resonators to Josephson ring modulators (JRMs), are vital and
versatile devices capable of processing microwave signals at the quantum limit.
Owing to the lossless nondegenerate three-wave mixing process enabled by the
JRM, JMs can perform phase preserving amplification of quantum signals,
generate two-mode squeezed states, and perform noiseless frequency conversion.
However, due to their limited bandwidth and saturation power, such
resonator-based JMs are generally unable to simultaneously process
frequency-multiplexed signals required in large quantum processors. To overcome
this longstanding dual challenge, we redesign the JRM parameters by optimizing
its inductances to suppress higher order mixing products and engineer its
electromagnetic environment by incorporating lumped-element coupled-mode
networks between the JRM and the two distinct ports of the JM. By implementing
these strategies, we measure for JMs realized with four coupled modes per port,
operated in amplification (conversion), bandwidths of about 400 MHz (700 MHz)
with power reflections above 10 dB (below -10 dB) and saturation powers of
about -110 dBm at 15 dB (-91 dBm at -26 dB). Similarly, we demonstrate for a
low external quality factor resonant-mode JM operated in conversion, a maximum
bandwidth of about $670$ MHz with power reflections below -10 dB and a maximum
saturation power of about -86 dBm at -17 dB. Such nondegenerate JMs with
enhanced bandwidths and saturation powers could serve in a variety of
frequency-multiplexed settings ranging from high fidelity qubit readout and
unidirectional routing of quantum signals to generation of remote entanglement
with continuous variables.

### [74] [A disputable assumption behind the empirical equivalence between pilot-wave theory and standard quantum mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06667)
*J. Manero,R. Muciño,E. Okon*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper suggests that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory might violate the assumption that information is configurationally grounded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper challenges the foundational assumptions of the pilot-wave theory, potentially introducing new implications for quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors analyze the derivations of key elements in the pilot-wave theory, particularly focusing on the assumption about information grounding.

Result: The analysis reveals that the theory may not uphold the 'information is configurationally grounded' assumption, affecting its compatibility with standard quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the need to reevaluate this assumption if the pilot-wave theory is to align with the principles of standard quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory asserts that a complete
characterization of an $N$-particle system is given by its wave function
together with the (at-all-times-defined) positions of the particles, with the
wave function always satisfying the Schr\"odinger equation and the positions
evolving according to the deterministic "guiding equation". A complete
agreement with the predictive apparatus of standard quantum mechanics,
including the uncertainty principle and the probabilistic Born rule, is then
said to emerge from these equations, without having to confer any special
status to measurements or observers. Two key elements behind the proof of this
complete agreement are absolute uncertainty and the POVM theorem. The former
involves an alleged "naturally emerging, irreducible limitation on the
possibility of obtaining knowledge within pilot-wave theory" and the latter
establishes that the outcome distributions of all measurements are described by
POVMs. Here, we argue that the derivations of absolute uncertainty and the POVM
theorem depend upon the questionable assumption that "information is always
configurationally grounded". We explain in detail why the offered rationale
behind such an assumption is deficient and explore the consequences of having
to let go of it.

Abstract: Many quantum networking applications require efficient photonic interfaces to
quantum memories which can be produced at scale and with high yield. Synthetic
diamond offers unique potential for the implementation of this technology as it
hosts color centers which retain coherent optical interfaces and long spin
coherence times in nanophotonic structures. Here, we report a technique
enabling wafer-scale processing of thin-film diamond that combines ion
implantation and membrane liftoff, high-quality overgrowth, targeted color
center implantation, and serial, high-throughput thermocompression bonding with
yields approaching unity. The deterministic deposition of thin diamond
membranes onto semiconductor substrates facilitates consistent integration of
photonic crystal cavities with silicon-vacancy (SiV) quantum memories. We
demonstrate reliable, strong coupling of SiVs to photons with cooperativities
approaching 100. Furthermore, we show that photonic crystal cavities can be
reliably fabricated across several membranes bonded to the same handling chip.
Our platform enables modular fabrication where the photonic layer can be
integrated with functionalized substrates featuring electronic control lines
such as coplanar waveguides for microwave delivery. Finally, we implement
passive optical packaging with sub-decibel insertion loss. Together, these
advances pave the way to the scalable assembly of optically addressable quantum
memory arrays which are a key building block for modular photonic quantum
interconnects.

Conclusion: 该研究为光腔中的量子气体动力学提供了强大的理论框架，推动了对复杂量子系统动态行为的理解。

Abstract: Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable
laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range
interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate
interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay
of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations.
Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms
at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective
theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field
is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly
perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective
Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of
polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to
the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large
intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime
and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field
seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical
description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature
interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to
strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework
for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits,
amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with
a versatile experimental platform.

### [77] [Reducing quantum resources for observable estimation with window-assisted coherent QPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06677)
*Harriet Apel,Cristian L. Cortes,Jessica Lemieux,Mark Steudtner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the limitations of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) despite perfect gates and states, leading to probabilistic failures. The authors propose using windowing techniques from classical signal processing to mitigate these issues, resulting in significant improvements in quantum resource estimates, specifically a reduction in Toffoli counts by two orders of magnitude. They also suggest that these findings can assist in understanding composite algorithms combining quantum building blocks with classical techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical issue in Quantum Phase Estimation, which is a foundational quantum algorithm used in many quantum computing applications. The authors propose a novel solution by integrating windowing techniques, commonly used in classical signal processing, into the quantum computing domain. This aims to reduce errors and improve the efficiency of quantum algorithms that rely on QPE as a subroutine, which is highly relevant given the limited understanding of error propagation in such composite algorithms.

Method: The authors analyze the root cause of QPE failures, which stems from the incompatibility between finite-sized quantum registers and the infinite precision required for phase representation. They propose a method involving windowing the phase register, inspired by classical signal processing, to capture the phase more effectively within the finite register. The method also involves comparing the previous QPE techniques with the new window-assisted approach, using quantum resource estimates to compare the performance, including the use of improved block encoding techniques to enhance the efficiency of the QPE subroutine.

Result: The study demonstrates that by windowing the phase register in QPE, accompanied by improved block encoding techniques, there is a substantial reduction in the Toffoli gate counts, achieving an improvement of over two orders of magnitude compared to previous methods. This result is promising as it reduces quantum computational resources, making quantum algorithms more feasible and efficient.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the integration of windowing techniques into Quantum Phase Estimation significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of quantum algorithms that utilize QPE as a subroutine. By addressing the fundamental limitations of QPE and demonstrating the benefits of window-assisted QPE, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding and improving the performance of composite quantum algorithms. The findings also suggest broader applications of windowing methods in other quantum algorithms, hinting at further potential advancements in quantum computing by combining quantum and classical processing techniques.

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) routines are known to fail probabilistically
even with perfect gates and input states. This effect stems from an
incompatibility of finite-sized quantum registers to capture a phase within QPE
with phase angles of infinite precision, and the effect extend even beyond what
would be reasonably expected from rounding. This effect can be partially
mitigated by biasing the phase register with a window, or taper state, from
classical signal processing. This paper focuses on how windowing a coherent QPE
used as a subroutine can improve the accuracy of the overall algorithm.
Specifically we study the quantum task of estimating observables where
window-assisted coherent QPE is used as a subroutine to implement a reflection
about an eigenstate. Quantum resource estimates show over 2-orders-of-magnitude
reduction in Toffoli counts over the previous costed techniques -- also
assisted by the use of improved block encoding techniques -- demonstrating an
encouraging decrease in resources for quantum computation of molecular
observables. Since QPE, as one of only a few quantum building blocks, appears
as a subroutine in many algorithms; this analysis also provides a model for
understanding how window functions propagate to an improved error in composite
algorithms.

*Alexandre Cesar Ricardo,Ciro Micheletti Diniz,Celso Jorge Villas-Bôas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores interference between electromagnetic and mechanical waves in trapped ions, using quantum mechanics, and proposes hybrid quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring quantum interference between different wave types could lead to novel quantum technologies and understanding of quantum systems.

Method: Ion-trap platform used to study interactions and manipulate states via electromagnetic and mechanical waves.

Result: Achieved controlled interference based on phase and amplitude, enabling population transfer modulation and potential quantum devices.

Conclusion: Opens up possibilities for hybrid quantum systems combining optics and mechanics.

Abstract: Classically, wave interference is a phenomenon that can be explained by
considering only the waves themselves, that is, without the need to consider
the apparatus that monitors or observes them. Thus, in classical theories,
interference can only occur between waves of the same nature. In quantum
theory, the observed results require a description of the system and its
measuring apparatus, which allows us to rethink the explanation of various
natural phenomena. In this paper, we consider the ion-trap platform to study
the interference of waves with different physical natures, specifically the
electromagnetic and mechanical. At first, we drive two lasers onto a
single-trapped ion to produce Jaynes-Cummings and Carrier interactions, where
we verify that, depending on the phase relationship between the coherent state
of the vibrational (mechanical) mode and the Carrier pulse (electromagnetic
wave), the interactions enhance or cancel out population transfer to the
electronic state of the ion, that works out as our measuring apparatus for
those waves. Extending our result to an ion chain, we verify that a precise
modulation of the Carrier Rabi frequency and phase (electromagnetic pulse)
according to the amplitude of the incoming mechanical coherent state in the ion
chain enables creating either constructive or destructive interference with
propagating pulses, in which the electronic state of the driven ion is,
respectively, populated more and faster, or transparent to both pulse waves,
when the information flux behaves as if no external fields are applied.
Finally, this new type of controlled interference between waves of different
natures allows us to propose new hybrid quantum devices, such as transistors or
filters of wave packets, where photonic (phononic) pulses control the passage
of phononic (photonic) waves.

TL;DR: This paper compares p-adic Schrödinger equations with their classical counterparts using continuous-time quantum Markov chains. Simulations reveal the quantum chains have a higher limiting distribution than classical ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum systems (especially CTQMCs) and their differences from classical Markov chains is crucial. This paper aims to explore these differences through numerical simulations, providing insights for quantum computing applications.

Method: The paper compares p-adic Schrödinger equations, specifically looking at CTQMCs, with p-adic heat equations and their CTMCs. A mathematical study and numerical simulations are used to solve initial value problems and approximate limiting distributions.

Result: Numerical simulations indicate quantum Markov chains have a higher stationary distribution than classical Markov chains.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that CTQMCs could exhibit quantum advantages over classical models, relevant for quantum algorithm development.

Abstract: The continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) are a fundamental tool in the
development of quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that discretizations
of p-adic Schr\"odinger equations give rise to continuous-time quantum Markov
chains (CTQMCs); this type of Markov chain includes the CTQWs constructed using
adjacency matrices of graphs as a particular case. In this paper, we study a
large class of p-adic Schr\"odinger equations and the associated CTQMCs by
comparing them with p-adic heat equations and the associated continuous-time
Markov chains (CTMCs). The comparison is done by a mathematical study of the
mentioned equations, which requires, for instance, solving the initial value
problems attached to the mentioned equations, and through numerical
simulations. We conducted multiple simulations, including numerical
approximations of the limiting distribution. Our simulations show that the
limiting distribution of quantum Markov chains is greater than the stationary
probability of their classical counterparts, for a large class of CTQMCs.

Result: 当使用光场时，误差幅度与原子数平方成正比，但平均误差与原子数线性增加。

Conclusion: 通过调整初始状态和相互作用时间，可有效降低量子门错误。

Abstract: When an electromagnetic field in a coherent or quasiclassical (e.g.,
squeezed) state is used to simultaneously drive an ensemble of two-level atoms,
the quantum nature of the field will, in general, cause the final state of the
atoms to differ from the one predicted for a totally classical field. This is a
potential source of error in quantum logic gates in which the gate is the
rotation of the atoms by a laser. In this paper, we use second order
perturbation theory to find how this error scales with the number of atoms,
$N$, being driven simultaneously, for an arbitrary rotation angle. The result
depends on the initial atomic state: for some highly entangled states, and a
field in a coherent state, the error may scale as $N^2$, yet we find that the
average over a random distribution of initial states only scales as $N$. We
discuss possible ways to mitigate the error, including the use of squeezed
states, as well as adjusting the interaction time between the field and atoms
to be different from what would be expected from the classical-field treatment.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of identifying the precise moment a quantum channel undergoes a transition, focusing on the quantum limit of the average success probability in unambiguous discrimination. authors propose a method to determine lower and upper bounds on this probability and provide an analytical expression for the case where channels are unitary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: quantum information theory and process discrimination are important areas, and identifying transition points between channels is a fundamental problem with practical applications in quantum computing and communication.

Method: The paper uses information theory and quantum mechanics to analyze the problem, proposes a method involving mathematical derivations and inequalities to find bounds and an analytical solution for unitary case.

Result: They establish bounds and an analytical formula for the transition detection probability when channels are unitary, contributing to more efficient algorithms for quantum process discrimination.

Conclusion: This work provides theoretical insights and practical tools for quantum process discrimination, advancing our understanding of optimal methods for detecting channel transitions with minimal errors.

Abstract: Identifying the precise moment when a quantum channel undergoes a change is a
fundamental problem in quantum information theory. We study how accurately one
can determine the time at which a channel transitions to another. We
investigate the quantum limit of the average success probability in unambiguous
discrimination, in which errors are completely avoided by allowing inconclusive
results with a certain probability. This problem can be viewed as a quantum
process discrimination task, where the process consists of a sequence of
quantum channels; however, obtaining analytical solutions for quantum process
discrimination is generally extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a
method to derive lower and upper bounds on the maximum average success
probability in unambiguous discrimination. In particular, when the channels
before and after the change are unitary, we show that the maximum average
success probability can be analytically expressed in terms of the length of the
channel sequence and the discrimination limits for the two channels.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) has been studied, but challenges like dipolar fields and B0/B1 inhomogeneities reduce its efficiency. A theoretical framework and various control sequences were developed to address these issues. Results provide guidance for designing better PHIP transfer sequences in liquid-state NMR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of PHIP depends on overcoming real-world experimental difficulties such as inhomogeneous magnetic fields and dipolar interactions which can reduce efficiency. This study provides both theoretical analysis and practical solutions for optimizing PHIP transfer sequences, making it more applicable in concentrated liquid-state NMR samples.

Method: The researchers used average Hamiltonian theory and numerical simulations to develop and analyze new control sequences. They considered both pulsed and continuous-wave methods and evaluated the effects of dipolar fields and chemical shifts.

Result: The study reveals that certain sequences can either hinder or enhance PHIP transfer efficiency depending on the specific conditions, offering guidelines for selecting effective transfer protocols. The findings suggest that optimized sequences can improve the efficiency and reliability of PHIP in practical experiments.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding and application of PHIP by addressing real-world limitations and providing optimized control sequences, paving the way for more robust hyperpolarization in concentrated liquid-state NMR systems.

Abstract: Para-hydrogen induced polarization (PHIP) achieves efficient
hyperpolarisation of nuclear spins with the transfer of the singlet order of
parahydrogen to target molecules through catalytic hydrogenation reactions and
subsequent coherent control of the spin dynamics. However, in realistic
conditions B0/B1 inhomogeneities lead to significant reduction in the
polarization transfer efficiency. Moreover, in high-concentration samples,
dipolar fields arising from the magnetisation of the sample can degrade
polarisation transfer efficiency significantly. In this work, we present a
theoretical framework and a comprehensive analysis of both pulsed and
continuous-wave (CW) control sequences designed to mitigate the detrimental
effects of dipolar fields, $B_0/B_1$ inhomogeneities, and moderate chemical
shifts. By combining tools from average Hamiltonian theory with detailed
numerical simulations, we introduce and characterise a wide range of transfer
sequences, including dipolar-field adjusted and dipolar-field suppressing
protocols. We identify conditions under which dipolar interactions either
hinder or, perhaps surprisingly, stabilise polarization transfer, depending on
the sequence structure. Our results offer practical guidance for the selection
and design of PHIP transfer sequences under realistic experimental constraints
and open pathways toward robust hyperpolarisation in concentrated liquid-state
NMR samples.

Abstract: Magnomechanical cavities offer a new frontier in quantum electrodynamics that
give rise to several significant theoretical and experimental results. In this
paper, we propose a novel theoretical mechanism for achieving a nonreciprocal
macroscopic entanglement between magnons, photons and phonons, based on the use
of an alternative squeezed magnons method. Indeed, in contrast to conventional
approaches, we show how precise control of the amplitude and phase of the
squeezed mode allows to obtain a tunable nonreciprocity of entanglement. The
magnons resulting from the collective motion of the spin in a macroscopic
ferrimagnet become coupled to the microwave photons via magnetic dipole
interaction and to the phonons via magnetostrictive interaction. Moreover, we
establish that the proposed scheme achieves ideal nonreciprocity, which can be
optimized by cavity-magnon coupling and bath temperature control. Finally, by
using the parameters that are experimentally feasible with current
technologies, this work provides new perspectives for hybrid magnon-based
quantum technologies.

Abstract: Non-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in atomically
thin materials provides new degrees of freedom and enhanced quantum information
capacity compared to conventional phase-matched sources. These systems emerged
as promising platforms for quantum computing, communication, and imaging, with
the potential to support higher-order nonlinear processes. However, direct
observation of photon-pair emission from a monolayer has remained
experimentally challenging. In this work, we theoretically modeled SPDC
emission across the full angular space from a monolayer GaSe film and
experimentally validated the model through measurements of both co- and
counter-propagating photon pairs. We demonstrated two-photon quantum
correlations in the telecom C-band from the thinnest SPDC source reported to
date. The spatially symmetric, broadband emission predicted by theory was
confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, we observed high-fidelity Bell states in
the counter-propagating configuration, marking the first realization of
polarization-entangled photon pairs from a monolayer. Our results revealed the
emission characteristics of SPDC in the deeply subwavelength, non-phase-matched
regime, and introduced atomically thin, counterpropagating SPDC as a scalable
and integrable platform for programmable quantum state generation, extendable
via moir\'e superlattice engineering.

Conclusion: 研究展示了基于量子行走的MST求解在资源效率和计算复杂性方面具有优势。

Abstract: We present a novel quantum walk-based approach to solve the Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) problem under a maximal degree constraint (MDC). By recasting the
classical MST problem as a quantum walk on a graph, where vertices are encoded
as quantum states and edge weights are inverted to define a modified
Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that the quantum evolution naturally selects the
MST by maximizing the cumulative transition probability (and thus the Shannon
entropy) over the spanning tree. Our method, termed Quantum Kruskal with MDC,
significantly reduces the quantum resource requirement to $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$
qubits while retaining a competitive classical computational complexity.
Numerical experiments on fully connected graphs up to $10^4$ vertices confirm
that, particularly for MDC values exceeding $4$, the algorithm delivers MSTs
with optimal or near-optimal total weights. When MDC values are less or equal
to $4$, some instances achieve a suboptimal solution, still outperforming
several established classical algorithms. These results open promising
perspectives for hybrid quantum-classical solutions in large-scale graph
optimization.

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with quantum computing is a critical
challenge, hindered by the severe constraints of Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) devices, including barren plateaus and limited coherence.
Current approaches often fail due to static quantum-classical partitioning. We
introduce Adaptive Quantum-Classical Fusion (AQCF), the first framework to
bridge this gap through dynamic, quantum-classical co-design. AQCF's core
principle is real-time adaptation: it analyzes input complexity to orchestrate
seamless transitions between classical and quantum processing. The framework
features three key innovations: (1) entropy-driven adaptive circuits that
circumvent barren plateaus; (2) quantum memory banks that unify classical
attention with quantum state-based similarity retrieval; and (3) intelligent
fusion controllers that allocate tasks for optimal performance. This
architecture maintains full compatibility with classical Transformers while
progressively incorporating quantum advantages. Experiments on sentiment
analysis demonstrate that AQCF achieves competitive performance, significantly
improves quantum resource efficiency, and operates successfully within typical
NISQ constraints. By providing a seamless integration pathway, AQCF offers both
immediate practical value on current quantum hardware and a clear evolution
path toward mature Quantum LLMs.

Abstract: We show that the distance between two qubits coupled to a structured

suppress Bell nonlocality. In a mirror-terminated guide, quantum correlations
lost to the bath return at discrete recurrence times, turning a product state
into a Bell-violating one without any entangling drive (only local basis
rotations/readout). In the continuum limit, we derive closed-form criteria for
the emergence of nonlocality from backflow, and introduce a Bell-based analogue
of the BLP measure to quantify this effect. We also show how subwavelength
displacements away from a decoherence-free node quadratically reduce the
lifetime of a dark state or bright state, enabling highly sensitive
interferometric detection. All results rely on analytically solvable models and
are compatible with current superconducting and nanophotonic platforms,
offering a practical route to passive, geometry-controlled non-Markovian

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a critical problem in quantum metrology, specifically the estimation of frequencies in quantum systems, which is essential for applications in sensing, calibration, and control. This challenge is tackled using Bayesian methods with an innovative approach called WES to enhance performance and efficiency.

Method: WES is designed as a Window Expansion Strategy for low-cost adaptive Bayesian experimental design. It incorporates empirical methods to reduce optimization overhead, manage scaling issues, and enable parallel processing. The classical processing costs are adjustable, allowing control over performance benchmarks. It compares WES with existing heuristics and random strategies, establishing its superior reliability and speed while approaching Heisenberg limits.

Result: Through numerical simulations, the paper demonstrates that WES provides the most reliable performance and the fastest learning rate, achieving saturation of the Heisenberg limit, outperforming traditional heuristics in metrology applications.

Conclusion: WES represents a significant advancement in quantum metrology, offering an efficient and effective solution for frequency estimation that surpasses current benchmarks, suggesting potential wide-ranging applications across quantum sensing and control technologies.

Abstract: A two-level quantum system evolving under a time-independent Hamiltonian
produces oscillatory measurement probabilities. The estimation of the
associated frequency is a cornerstone problem in quantum metrology, sensing,
calibration and control. In this work, we tackle this task by introducing WES:
a Window Expansion Strategy for low cost adaptive Bayesian experimental design.
WES employs empirical cost-reduction techniques to keep the optimization
overhead low, curb scaling problems, and enable high degrees of parallelism.
Unlike previous heuristics, it offers adjustable classical processing costs
that determine the performance standard. As a benchmark, we analyze the
performance of widely adopted heuristics, comparing them with the fundamental
limits of metrology and a baseline random strategy. Numerical simulations show
that WES delivers the most reliable performance and fastest learning rate,
saturating the Heisenberg limit.

Abstract: Quantum linear system (QLS) algorithms offer the potential to solve
large-scale linear systems exponentially faster than classical methods.
However, applying QLS algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging due
to issues such as state preparation, data loading, and efficient information
extraction. In this work, we study the feasibility of applying QLS algorithms
to solve discretized three-dimensional heterogeneous Poisson equations, with
specific examples relating to groundwater flow through geologic fracture
networks. We explicitly construct a block encoding for the 3D heterogeneous
Poisson matrix by leveraging the sparse local structure of the discretized
operator. While classical solvers benefit from preconditioning, we show that
block encoding the system matrix and preconditioner separately does not improve
the effective condition number that dominates the QLS runtime. This differs
from classical approaches where the preconditioner and the system matrix can
often be implemented independently. Nevertheless, due to the structure of the
problem in three dimensions, the quantum algorithm achieves a runtime of
$O(N^{2/3} \ \text{polylog } N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$, outperforming the best
classical methods (with runtimes of $O(N \log N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$) and
offering exponential memory savings. These results highlight both the promise
and limitations of QLS algorithms for practical scientific computing, and point
to effective condition number reduction as a key barrier in achieving quantum
advantages.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model reveal a
rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of
quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance,
experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing
controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization
of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by
employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of
quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a
phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian
limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally
probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized
by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel
spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all
quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to
changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological
origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry
breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for
future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.

Abstract: A central challenge in quantum metrology is to identify optimal protocols
under measurement constraints that reflect realistic experimental conditions,
e.g., local measurements in multipartite scenarios. Here, we present a
sufficient criterion for metrological schemes to saturate the quantum
Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) using local measurements, based on stabilizer
formalism. In ideal settings, we show that graph states always admit local
estimation protocols with an optimal estimation precision determined only by
the underlying graph structure. A family of graph states is identified as probe
states that achieve suboptimal precision scaling. In noisy environments, we
construct several subspaces of probe states (mixed in general) that not only
saturate the QCRB with local measurements but also maintain approximately
invariant precision scaling. These subspaces offer multiple metrological
advantages, including high precision, partial noise resilience, and
noise-correcting capability prior to parameter encoding. Under dephasing noise,
they exhibit markedly better performance than Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
states. Our results advance the framework for local-measurement quantum
metrology, achieving a robust trade-off between precision and noise tolerance.

Abstract: Given a set of ordered quantum states, described by density operators $%

quantum information science. Bosonic Gaussian states are a class of quantum
states on infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, widely used in quantum optics and
quantum information science. Bosonic Gaussian states are conveniently and
conventionally characterized by their means and covariance matrices. In this
work, we provide the expression of Bargmann invariant tr($\rho _{1}\rho
_{2}...\rho _{n}$) for any $m$-mode bosonic Gaussian states $\{\rho

Abstract: It is known that the existence of memory effect can revive quantum
correlations in open system dynamics. In this regard, the backflow of
information from environment to the system can be identified with Complete
Positive (CP) indivisibility as well as Positive (P) indivisibility criteria.
It is also known that if a quantum system is CP-divisible, it can also have
memory effect which can be witnessed by P-indivisibility. Here, we have
explored the relation of P-divisibility with unitality condition of noise
channels, showing that a unital channel is P-divisible. We have shown how a
system channel and its environment need to be both P-divisible, but cannot be
both P-indivisible, provided the system-environment joint quantum state evolves
unitarily. We have also established our results using three unitaries acting on
different sets of states. In particular, due to backflow of information from
the environment, quantumness of a system can increase, as shown for an example
of the three-qubit W state.

Abstract: Understanding quantum correlations through information-theoretic measures is
fundamental to developments in quantum field theory, quantum information, and
quantum many-body physics. A central feature in a plethora of systems is the
area law, under which information scales with the size of the boundary of the
system, rather than volume. Whilst many systems and regimes exhibiting an area
law have been identified theoretically, experimental verification remains
limited, particularly in continuous systems. We present a methodology for
measuring mutual information in an experimental simulator of non-interacting
quantum fields, and propose using the analogue $(2 + 1)$-dimensional spacetime
offered by thin films of superfluid helium. We provide numerical predictions
incorporating the natural thermal state of the helium sample that exemplify an
area-law scaling of mutual information, and characterise deviations
attributable to the inherent finite system size.

Abstract: Characterizing correlations in a quantum system on the basis of the results
of the projective measurements can be performed with different means including
the calculation of the classical mutual information. Generally, estimating such
information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the
system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical
mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network
approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a
prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in
transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both
condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network
approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in
the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In
addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed
with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework to study entropy dynamics in quantum-classical systems under strong coupling, shows suppression of net entropy transfer achieving thermodynamic efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding entropy dynamics in quantum systems is crucial for quantum thermodynamics and hardware design.

Method: Developed a multi-replica master equation to handle strong coupling and evaluate entropy flow.

Result: Demonstrated suppression of entropy transfer due to quantum coherence and hybridization, leading to thermodynamic bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Provides a general framework for entropy analysis and design of efficient quantum hardware.

Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and
entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be
expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only
a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics
of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors
addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited
to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling
between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting
multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and
related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results
show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy
transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a
general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more
robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.

Motivation: 研究者关注于如何更简洁地理解量子系统中的柯ishes佩克集合，特别是在三态系统中的对称性结构和应用。

Method: 通过构造一个对称且满足性质的集合，计算发现其满足KS集合的条件，并呈现更多对称性和较低的基底数目。

Result: 发现了具有更高对称性的14个基底的KS集合，证实了前一猜想不成立，并为之前的qutrit策略记录提供了新的最低输入数。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过构建更对称的KS集合，不仅在三态系统中更高效，还反驳了现有猜想，提示了更高效的量子策略可能在未来研究中得到应用。

Abstract: Kochen-Specker (KS) sets are fundamental in physics. Every time nature
produces bipartite correlations attaining the nonsignaling limit, or two
parties always win a nonlocal game impossible to always win classically, is
because the parties are measuring a KS set. The simplest quantum system in
which all these phenomena occur is a pair of three-level systems. However, the
simplest KS sets in dimension three known are asymmetrical and require a large
number of bases (the current minimum is 16, set by Peres and Penrose). Here we
present a KS set that is much more symmetrical and easier to prove than any
previous example. It sets a new record for minimum number of bases, 14, and
enables us to refute Conjecture 2 in Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 010201 (2025),
setting a new record for qutrit-qutrit perfect strategies with a minimum number
of inputs: 5-9.

### [100] [Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08160)
*Georgios Styliaris,Rahul Trivedi,J. Ignacio Cirac*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper shows that matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit, achieving long-range entanglement, and includes MPUs from C^*-weak Hopf algebras.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on the implementation of MPUs, which are significant in quantum information and many-body physics. The challenge lies in converting non-unitary tensors into a quantum circuit, which has implications for quantum computing and simulation.

Method: The authors construct a polynomial-depth circuit by decomposing each tensor into a sequence of unitary operations, showing that any MPU can be rewritten as a product of gates with a depth that scales polynomially with the system size.

Result: The construction allows for the implementation of a broad class of MPUs, including those generating long-range entanglement, and provides depth estimates based on the system's constants.

Conclusion: Thus, implementing the described method enables the practical use of MPUs in quantum computing, overcoming the unitarity obstacle in their construction.

Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a
consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area
law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum
circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In
this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a
polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated
bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of
polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant
$\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size
$N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate
long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries
constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we
also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show
that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \,
\mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$
being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value
of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter
on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing
interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum
processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent
topological states. By engineering diagonal
Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally
demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet
engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the
commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally
realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor
is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum
system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy
gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the
distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile
hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in

*Shehbaz Tariq,Junaid ur Rehman,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum diversity strategy for MIMO channels using approximate cloning and purification, and it shows that while this method has advantages, especially when full CSI is available, it's not always beneficial due to the dilution cost of cloning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for reliable quantum communication, inspired by traditional MIMO techniques, aiming to enhance communication reliability by distributing quantum information across multiple channels and purifying the received state.

Method: The approach involves using approximate cloning at the transmitter to distribute information across multiple channels followed by purification at the receiver to merge and refine the noisy joint state into a single quantum state. Direct comparison with simpler strategies like best-channel selection is performed to evaluate performance.

Result: Numerical results demonstrate that the cloning-purification strategy can offer advantages, particularly when full CSI is utilized for optimizing cloning asymmetry. However, the study also reveals that distributing quantum information across all channels isn't always beneficial, primarily due to the dilution cost inherent in cloning operations.

Conclusion: The proposed cloning-purification strategy enhances quantum communication reliability in specific scenarios by leveraging advanced quantum channel management techniques, but it's not universally superior due to practical limitations related to cloning efficiency and resource allocation.

Abstract: Quantum communication plays a pivotal role in enabling distributed quantum
computing and sensing. Diversity strategies can be used to increase the
communication reliability (in the sense of output fidelity with respect to the
input quantum state) when multiple communication channels are available. The
current paper proposes a diversity strategy for quantum discrete variable (DV)
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, utilizing approximate cloning
to distribute information across multiple channels at the transmitter and
purification to merge the noisy and entangled joint state into a single quantum
state at the receiver. The proposed method is compared with simpler strategies,
such as the best-channel selection, to identify the advantage regions over a
quantum channel combining both crosstalk and depolarization, where the
crosstalk is modeled by a controlled-SWAP operator. Our numerical results show
that the cloning-purification strategy offers an advantage, especially in cases
where full channel state information (CSI) can be exploited to optimize the
cloning asymmetry. More importantly, and in contrast to the classic MIMO
diversity, we demonstrate that the distribution of quantum information over all
available channels does not always provide an advantage due to the dilution
cost of the cloning operation.

Abstract: Accurate calculation of strongly correlated electronic systems requires
proper treatment of both static and dynamic correlations, which remains
challenging for conventional methods. To address this, we present VQE-PDFT, a
quantum-classical hybrid framework that integrates variational quantum
eigensolver with multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT).
This framework strategically employs quantum circuits for multiconfigurational
wavefunction representation while utilizing density functionals for correlation
energy evaluation. The hybrid strategy maintains accurate treatment of static
and dynamic correlations while reducing quantum resource requirements.
Benchmark validation on the Charge-Transfer dataset confirmed that VQE-PDFT
achieves results comparable to conventional MC-PDFT. Building upon this, we
developed shallow-depth hardware-efficient ansatz circuits and integrated them
into a QM/MM multiscale architecture to enable applications in complex
biological systems. This extended framework, when applied to electron transfer
in the European robin cryptochrome protein ErCRY4, yielded transfer rates that
align well with experimental measurements. Importantly, successful execution on
actual quantum hardware demonstrates practical feasibility for biological
quantum computing applications, supported by comprehensive error analysis.

and other highly regarded quantum resources, such as coherence, imaginary, and
predictability. Our research complements the measure theory of quantum-state
texture and enriches the theory framework of quantum-state texture resource.

### [105] [A Method for Constructing Quasi-Random Peaked Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07491)
*O. G. Udalov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: An algorithm is introduced that constructs peaked quantum circuits, which exhibit high concentration on a specific bitstring. The circuit uses a brick-wall architecture with random gates. The algorithm allows for precise control over the peak probability but uses the MPS method for simulation, which is more effective for shallow circuits than deeper ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to explore methods for creating quantum circuits with desired output states, likely for applications in quantum computing and information processing.

Method: The paper proposes a method using a brick-wall architecture of random gates to construct 'peaked' quantum circuits. The MPS simulation method is evaluated for these circuits.

Result: The result is that the algorithm allows precise control over the peaked probability, but the MPS simulation method is only efficient for shallow, rather than deeply structured, circuits.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that while the algorithm successfully creates peaked quantum states, the simulation method has limitations for deeper circuit structures, implying further research is needed for more efficient simulation techniques.

Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum
circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability
concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist
of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit
state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the
final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A
technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the
quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of
the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the
construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product
state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs
effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for
deeper ones.

Conclusion: 研究者提出了统一的graded量子码，结合代数几何和链复形方法，展示了其在多个领域的应用价值。未来的研究可进一步优化码的设计并探索更多应用。

Abstract: We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum
error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG)
codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective
spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted
degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method
with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted
heights.The second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces,
generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple
gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on
homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors.
  A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k +
2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments
from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple
orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields.
  Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum
computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic
geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces advanced gate search techniques for trapped-ion systems that enhance gate performance and flexibility while addressing laser control challenges. They improve upon existing schemes by incorporating error mitigation strategies, multi-objective optimization, unpaired pulses, and symmetry-based control methods, achieving high-fidelity gate operations with tens of ions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is driven by the need to overcome limitations of existing multi-qubit gate protocols in trapped-ion systems, particularly the increased laser control requirements and error-prone transitions, by proposing improved gate search schemes that leverage advanced control methods and symmetries to boost performance.

Method: The authors present an improved gate search scheme using a multi-objective machine design approach, incorporating dominant error sources, allowing unpaired pulses, and applying symmetries to reduce phase noise. They also perform simulations to analyze gate performance under various errors.

Result: The methods successfully demonstrate the feasibility of achieving microsecond two-qubit gates with high fidelities (99.9%) between arbitrary ion pairs in 50-ion processors, despite experimental and systematic errors.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that integrating these advanced control strategies and error mitigation techniques can significantly enhance the scalability and reliability of trapped-ion quantum processors, paving the way for fault-tolerant quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Non-adiabatic two-qubit gate proposals for trapped-ion systems offer superior
performance and flexibility over adiabatic schemes at the cost of increased
laser control requirements. Existing fast gate schemes are limited by
single-qubit transition errors, which constrain the total number of pulses in
high-fidelity solutions. We introduce an improved gate search scheme that
enables both local and non-local two-qubit gates in chains containing tens of
ions. These protocols use a multi-objective machine design approach that
incorporates dominant sources of error in the design to ensure the solutions
are compatible with existing fast laser controls. We also generalize previous
schemes by allowing for unpaired pulses during the gate evolution. By imposing
symmetries on the pulse sequences, we eliminate susceptibility to laser phase
noise and further simplify the multi-mode control over the state-dependent
motion of the ion crystal. We perform a comprehensive analysis of expected gate
performance in the presence of random and systematic experimental errors to
demonstrate the feasibility of performing microsecond two-qubit gates between
arbitrary ion pairs in current linear ion-trap processors of up to $50$ ions
with fidelities approaching $99.9\%$.

Abstract: In recent years, efficient quantum circuit simulations incorporating ideal
noise assumptions have relied on tensor network simulators, particularly
leveraging the matrix product density operator (MPDO) framework. However,
experiments on real noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices often
involve complex noise profiles, encompassing uncontrollable elements and
instrument-specific effects such as crosstalk. To address these challenges, we
employ quantum process tomography (QPT) techniques to directly capture the
operational characteristics of the experimental setup and integrate them into
numerical simulations using MPDOs. Our QPT-assisted MPDO simulator is then
applied to explore a variational approach for generating noisy entangled
states, comparing the results with standard noise numerical simulations and
demonstrations conducted on the Quafu cloud quantum computation platform.
Additionally, we investigate noisy MaxCut problems, as well as the effects of
crosstalk and noise truncation. Our results provide valuable insights into the
impact of noise on NISQ devices and lay the foundation for enhanced design and
assessment of quantum algorithms in complex noise environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental deployment of a new design for
combined quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
Novel to our system is the dynamic obfuscation of the QKD-PQC sequence of
operations, the number of operations, and parameters related to the operations;
coupled to the integration of a GPS-free quantum synchronization protocol
within the QKD process. We compare the performance and overhead of our QKD-PQC
system relative to a standard QKD system with one-time pad encryption,
demonstrating that our design can operate in real time with little additional
overhead caused by the new security features. Since our system can offer
additional defensive strategies against a wide spectrum of practical attacks
that undermine deployed QKD, PQC, and certain combinations of these two
primitives, we suggest that our design represents one of the most secure
communication systems currently available. Given the dynamic nature of its
obfuscation attributes, our new system can also be adapted in the field to
defeat yet-to-be-discovered practical attacks.

Conclusion: 强驱动力促使量子系统进入特定稳态，发现NESS遵循玻色定律；扩展了Floquet理论，研究一般驱动情况下的系统行为，声称能在Born-Markov近似之外的情况进行研究。

Abstract: Periodic driving is used to steer physical systems to unique stationary
states or nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), producing enhanced properties
inaccessible to non-driven systems. For open quantum systems, characterizing
the NESS is challenging and existing results are generally limited to specific
types of driving and the Born-Markov approximation. Here we go beyond these
limits by studying a generic periodically driven $ N$-level quantum system
interacting with a low-density thermal gas. Exploiting the framework of Floquet
scattering theory, we establish general Floquet thermalization conditions
constraining the nature of the NESS and the transition rates. Moreover, we
examine theoretically the structure of the NESS at high temperatures, and find
out that the NESS complies, rather surprisingly, with the Boltzmann law for any
driving. Numerical calculations illustrate our theoretical elaborations for a
simple toy model.

Abstract: In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME)
emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial
symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While
theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its
multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and
control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully
connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from
short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent
manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states,
elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ
entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced
density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry
breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches
from tilted N\'{e}el states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in
intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy
dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the
introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic
states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides
the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting
platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum
many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information
applications.

### [112] [GPU-Accelerated Syndrome Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes below the 63 $μ$s Latency Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07879)
*Oscar Ferraz,Bruno Coutinho,Gabriel Falcao,Marco Gomes,Francisco A. Monteiro,Vitor Silva*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated decoder for quantum codes achieving sub-63 μs latency, improving upon surface code decoders. It addresses the scalability issue of quantum codes by using QLDPC codes with constant-rate encoding and asymptotic goodness. The decoder leverages GPU parallelism to meet tight timing constraints, suggesting a pathway for real-time quantum computation beyond surface codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The combination of quantum error correction with hardware acceleration like GPUs is a natural progression in the field, aiming to bridge the gap for scalable quantum computing.

Method: The method involves using parallelized belief propagation on GPUs to decode QLDPC codes, achieving latency improvements.

Result: The decoder achieves low latencies, especially for smaller codes, significantly reducing the time required for decoding beyond surface code capabilities.

Conclusion: This work shows that scalable quantum decoding can be achieved using commodity GPUs, making real-time quantum computation possible with better codes than surface codes.

Abstract: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated decoder for quantum low-density
parity-check (QLDPC) codes that achieves sub-$63$ $\mu$s latency, below the
surface code decoder's real-time threshold demonstrated on Google's Willow
quantum processor. While surface codes have demonstrated below-threshold
performance, the encoding rates approach zero as code distances increase,
posing challenges for scalability. Recently proposed QLDPC codes, such as those
by Panteleev and Kalachev, offer constant-rate encoding and asymptotic goodness
but introduce higher decoding complexity. To address such limitation, this work
presents a parallelized belief propagation decoder leveraging syndrome
information on commodity GPU hardware. Parallelism was exploited to maximize
performance within the limits of target latency, allowing decoding latencies
under $50$ $\mu$s for [[$784$, $24$, $24$]] codes and as low as $23.3$ $\mu$s
for smaller codes, meeting the tight timing constraints of superconducting
qubit cycles. These results show that real-time, scalable decoding of
asymptotically good quantum codes is achievable using widely available
commodity hardware, advancing the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum
computation beyond surface codes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高量子计算的可靠性和可扩展性是当前量子计算领域的重要研究方向。量子错误纠正码（QEC）是实现可靠量子计算的关键技术。然而，传统的QEC需要大量ancilla量子位来存储错误综合征，这导致了物理量子位数量庞大，限制了量子计算机的规模。因此，如何降低ancilla量子位的需求，从而提高量子计算的效率和可扩展性，成为一个重要问题。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种减少量子计算中ancilla量子位数量的新方法，该方法通过优化CSS码的 syndrome测量电路，在保持可靠性的前提下显著降低了所需的物理量子位数量。这为大规模量子计算提供了重要的技术突破，有助于克服潜在的资源限制，推动量子计算实现实用规模。

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are a vital technology for demonstrating
reliable quantum computation. They require data qubits for encoding quantum
information and ancillary qubits for taking error syndromes necessary for error
correction. The need for a large number of ancillary qubits is an overhead
specific to quantum computing, and it prevents the scaling of quantum computers
to a useful size. In this work, we propose a framework for generating efficient
syndrome measurement circuits with a few ancillary qubits in CSS codes and
provide a method to minimize the total number of physical qubits in general
settings. We demonstrated our proposal by applying it to surface codes, and we
generated syndrome measurement circuits under several constraints of total
qubit count. As a result, we find that balanced data and ancillary qubit counts
achieve the lower logical error rates under a fixed total number of physical
qubits. This result indicates that using fewer ancillary qubits than the number
of stabilizers can be effective for reducing logical error rates in a practical
noise model.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel gradient descent algorithm for approximating projective norms of higher-order tensors, noting that calculating these norms is NP-hard and thus challenging. The algorithm provides guarantees for convergence to a minimal nuclear rank decomposition, extended to symmetric tensors and density matrices. Numerical results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness for pure and mixed states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity involved in computing projective norms, especially for higher-order tensors, poses a significant challenge. The need for efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees is crucial for applications in quantum information theory.

Method: They introduced a gradient descent approach that ensures convergence to the minimal nuclear rank decomposition, applying it to symmetric tensors and density matrices.

Result: Numerical experiments confirm the algorithm's effectiveness in calculating nuclear ranks and projective norms for various quantum states.

Conclusion: The approach offers a computationally feasible method to tackle the NP-hard problem, providing viable solutions for quantum information analysis.

Abstract: Projective Norms are a class of tensor norms that map on the input and output
spaces. These norms are useful for providing a measure of entanglement.
Calculating the projective norms is an NP-hard problem, which creates
challenges in computing due to the complexity of the exponentially growing
parameter space for higher-order tensors. We develop a novel gradient descent
algorithm to estimate the projective norm of higher-order tensors. The
algorithm guarantees convergence to a minimum nuclear rank decomposition of our
given tensor. We extend our algorithm to symmetric tensors and density
matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by computing the
nuclear rank and the projective norm for both pure and mixed states and provide
numerical evidence for the same.

Abstract: In scenarios where full access to all qubits of a multipartite quantum system
is available and global operations can be implemented, the preparation of
arbitrary entangled states - including multipartite Dicke states - is
theoretically straightforward. However, practical constraints often limit
direct control over all qubits. In this work, we first present an efficient
method for preparing a four-qubit Dicke state, and then demonstrate how a
four-qubit Dicke state can be expanded to a five-qubit Dicke state even when
only a subset of qubits is accessible. We propose a quantum circuit that
achieves this transformation under restricted control, and support our
analytical derivation with numerical simulations. We further carry out a
robustness analysis of our circuit under imperfect gate implementations and
find that it retains high fidelity for experimentally relevant levels of
coherent over-rotation errors, confirming its resilience to realistic noise.

Abstract: The $\mathbf{A}^2$ term presents a fundamental challenge to realizing the
superradiant phase transition (SPT) in cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, we
propose a hybrid quantum system enabling SPT regardless of the presence of the
$\mathbf{A}^2$ term. The system consisting of a qubit, a mechanical mode, and
an optical cavity, where the qubit and mechanical mode constitute a quantum
Rabi model, while the mechanical mode and cavity form an optomechanical system.
Crucially, the auxiliary cavity introduces a switchable $\mathbf{A}^2$ term
that effectively counteracts or even fully eliminates the original
$\mathbf{A}^2$ effect. This allows controllable observation of SPT, diagnosed
via the second-order equal-time correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ of phonons.
Furthermore, the auxiliary cavity exponentially reduces the critical coupling
strength, significantly relaxing experimental requirements. Besides, we show
that phonons in the normal phase are bunching, but coherent in the superradiant
phase. Interestly, higher-order squeezing is found in both phases, with
near-perfect higher-order squeezing achieved at SPT point, establishing it as a
probe for SPT behavior. Our work demonstrates that hybridizing optomechanics
and cavity quantum electrodynamics provides a promising route to accessing SPT
physics in the presence of the $\mathbf{A}^2$ term.

### [117] [Superresolution for two incoherent optical sources with arbitrary intensities in two dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08049)
*Junyan Li,Shengshi Pang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a quantum superresolution technique that surpasses the Rayleigh criterion for two-dimensional imaging, achieving subdiffractional resolution by estimating the separation between two point sources with non-zero precision even when they are infinitesimally close. The study demonstrates that alignment of point sources along specific directions and precise measurement techniques can enhance estimation accuracy. However, it also reveals a limitation where the relative azimuth's resolution degrades quadratically as the sources come closer, indicating a fundamental limit in resolving their orientation when they are too close.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seems to push the boundaries of optical imaging by leveraging quantum metrology to overcome the classical Rayleigh limit, particularly in two-dimensional systems. The premise is intriguing as it suggests that quantum mechanics can offer a way to achieve super-resolution beyond the traditional constraints, which could have significant implications for fields like medical imaging, astronomy, and microscopy.

Method: The authors use multiparameter quantum estimation theory to analyze the precision limits of distance and relative azimuth measurements between two incoherent point sources. They likely derive mathematical models or use Fisher information matrices to compute the ultimate estimation precision for the distance and azimuth angles. They also consider the impact of point-spread functions (PSFs) symmetry on the estimation accuracy for the distance by aligning the sources along particular directions.

Result: The key findings include achieving subdiffractional resolution for the distance between two incoherent point sources, even as they approach zero separation, surpassing the Rayleigh criterion. They also show how alignment can enhance precision, but they identify a quadratic decay in the resolution of the relative azimuth when sources are too close, indicating a fundamental limit in estimating their orientation.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for quantum-assisted optical imaging by demonstrating that quantum super-resolution is possible in two-dimensional systems. However, it also reveals essential limitations in estimating multiple parameters simultaneously, highlighting the need for further research to overcome these constraints and perhaps employing hybrid quantum-classical methods for more comprehensive parameter estimation.

Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion has long served as a fundamental limit for the
resolution of classical optical imaging. However, recent advances in quantum
metrology have led to the quantum superresolution technique that can break
Rayleigh's curse and estimate the separation between a pair of incoherent point
sources with nonvanishing precision. For two-dimensional optical systems, the
precision limit of estimating the whole separation, i.e., the distance, between
two point sources remains unknown so far. In this paper, we investigate the
estimation precision of the distance between two incoherent point sources with
arbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging system. Through the
multiparameter quantum estimation theory, we obtain the ultimate estimation
precision of the distance and show that it remains nonzero when the distance
approaches zero, which surpasses the Rayleigh criterion. We further show that
the precision can be enhanced by aligning the two point sources along specific
directions if the point-spread functions of the two sources are not circularly
symmetric, and find the optimial relative azimuth between the two point sources
and the highest estimation precision of the distance. In addition to the
distance estimation, we also consider the quantum estimation of the relative
azimuth between two incoherent point sources. A surprising result is that the
precision limit of the azimuth decays quadratically with the distance, which
suggests that the azimuth cannot be resolved when the two point sources get
sufficiently close to each other and is therefore inaccessible by the quantum
superresolution technique in this case. This reveals a new and fundamental
limitation on the resolvability of two incoherent point sources in
multi-dimensional quantum imaging which cannot be addressed by optimizing the
quantum measurements.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines how quantum information processing affects the perception of complexity in adaptive strategies compared to classical agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to understand how quantum information processing can influence an agent's complexity perception.

Method: The research employs mathematical modeling and analysis in the realm of quantum information theory and complexity science to explore this phenomenon.

Result: The key findings reveal that quantum agents can have differing conclusions about strategy complexity compared to classical agents, and they establish an information-theoretic lower bound on memory requirements.

Conclusion: This research suggests that quantum information offers a unique perspective on complexity, potentially revolutionizing how complexity is measured and understood in adaptive systems.

Abstract: Whether winning blackjack or navigating busy streets, achieving desired
outcomes requires agents to execute adaptive strategies, strategies where
actions depend contextually on past events. In complexity science, this
motivates memory as an operational quantifier of complexity: given two
strategies, the more complex one demands the agent to track more about the
past. Here, we show that conclusions about complexity fundamentally depend on
whether agents can process and store quantum information. Thus, while classical
agents might find Strategy A more complex to execute than Strategy B, quantum
agents can reach the opposite conclusion. We derive sufficient conditions for
such contradictory conclusions and illustrate the phenomenon across multiple
scenarios. As a byproduct, our results yield an information-theoretic lower
bound on the minimal memory required by any agent - classical or quantum - to
execute a given strategy.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Recent work shows hexagonal qubit layouts with only three couplers are as effective as traditional ones. This paper proposes a method to handle broken qubits and couplers in such layouts, extending the LUCI framework. The method improves circuit distance when components are broken, making hexagonal grids more viable for large-scale quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of maintaining quantum error correction capabilities despite hardware component failures, which is a critical concern for scalable quantum computing. Hexagonal layouts are efficient, so enhancing their resilience is important.

Method: The authors extend the LUCI framework, likely incorporating strategies to identify and manage broken components during error correction, thereby improving fault tolerance.

Result: The method enables hexagonal surface codes to handle broken elements, improving circuit distance, thus making large-scale quantum error correction feasible.

Conclusion: The proposed LUCI extension provides a robust solution for hardware failures, supporting the scalability of quantum computing with hexagonal qubit architectures.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that a hexagonal grid qubit layout, with only three
couplers per qubit, is sufficient to implement the surface code with
performance comparable to that of a traditional four-coupler layout [McEwen et
al., 2023]. In this work we propose a method for handling broken qubits and
couplers even in hex-grid surface code architectures, using an extension of the
LUCI framework [Debroy et al., 2024]. We show that for isolated broken qubits,
the circuit distance drops by one, while for isolated broken couplers, the
distance drops by one in one or both bases. By providing a viable dropout
strategy, we have removed a critical roadblock to the implementation of
hexagonal qubit grids in hardware for large-scale quantum error correction.

Abstract: Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling
scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of
the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that
with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites
and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average
transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required
time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality
quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet
centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site
magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the
inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully
designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the
dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values
of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to
longer range coupling schemes.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a protocol to estimate logical Pauli channels conditioned on specific syndrome outcomes using noise-robust methods, validated on a trapped-ion device.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for scalable quantum computing requires accurate characterization of quantum error correction circuits, especially under realistic hardware noise. This research focuses on estimating logical error rates to improve fault tolerance validation and mitigation strategies.

Method: The method introduces a protocol using SPAM-robust Bayesian modeling to analyze two or more syndrome gadgets, conditioned on observed parity outcomes. It is suitable for flag-based syndrome measurement schemes and specifically tested on a trapped-ion device (Quantinuum H1-1).

Result: The results show significant improvements in noise diagnostic tests for fault tolerance when using strategies like swapped measurements and Pauli frame randomization. This validates the protocol's effectiveness in enhancing error correction techniques.

Conclusion: The protocol provides a practical approach for estimating logical channels under realistic noise, which is essential for advancing scalable quantum computing. It offers a foundation for integrating noise-aware techniques into quantum hardware advancements.

Abstract: Characterizing how quantum error correction circuits behave under realistic
hardware noise is essential for testing the premises that enable scalable fault
tolerance. Logical error rates conditioned on syndrome outcomes are needed to
enable noise-aware decoding and validate threshold-relevant assumptions. We
introduce a protocol to directly estimate the logical Pauli channels (and pure
errors) associated with detector regions formed of two or more syndrome
extraction gadgets, conditioned on observing a particular parity in the
syndrome outcomes. The method is SPAM-robust and most suitable for flag-based
syndrome measurement schemes. For classical processing of the experimental data
we implement a Bayesian modelling approach. We validate this new protocol on a
small error-detecting code using Quantinuum H1-1, a trapped-ion device, and
demonstrate that several noise diagnostic tests for fault tolerance improve
significantly when using noise tailoring and mitigation strategies, such as
swapped measurements for leakage protection, and Pauli frame randomization.

Abstract: While quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes are a low-overhead means
of quantum information storage, it is valuable for quantum codes to possess
fault-tolerant features beyond this resource efficiency. In this work, we
introduce trivariate tricycle (TT) codes, qLDPC codes that combine several
desirable features: high thresholds under a circuit-level noise model, partial
single-shot decodability for low-time-overhead decoding, a large set of
transversal Clifford gates and automorphisms within and between code blocks,
and (for several sub-constructions) constant-depth implementations of a
(non-Clifford) $CCZ$ gate. TT codes are CSS codes based on a length-3 chain
complex, and are defined from three trivariate polynomials, with the 3D toric
code (3DTC) belonging to this construction. We numerically search for TT codes
and find several candidates with improved parameters relative to the 3DTC,
using up to 48$\times$ fewer data qubits as equivalent 3DTC encodings. We
construct syndrome-extraction circuits for these codes and numerically
demonstrate single-shot decoding in the X error channel in both
phenomenological and circuit-level noise models. Under circuit-level noise, TT
codes have a threshold of $0.3\%$ in the Z error channel and $1\%$ in the X
error channel (with single-shot decoding). All TT codes possess several
transversal $CZ$ gates that can partially address logical qubits between two
code blocks. Additionally, the codes possess a large set of automorphisms that
can perform Clifford gates within a code block. Finally, we establish several
TT code polynomial constructions that allows for a constant-depth
implementation of logical $CCZ$ gates. We find examples of error-correcting and
error-detecting codes using these constructions whose parameters out-perform
those of the 3DTC, using up to $4\times$ fewer data qubits for
equivalent-distance 3DTC encodings.

Abstract: De novo genome assembly is challenging in highly repetitive regions; however,
reference-guided assemblers often suffer from bias. We propose a framework for
pangenome-guided sequence assembly, which can resolve short-read data in
complex regions without bias towards a single reference genome. Our method
frames assembly as a graph traversal optimisation problem, which can be
implemented on quantum computers. The pipeline first annotates pangenome graphs
with estimated copy numbers for each node, then finds a path on the graph that
best explains those copy numbers. On simulated data, our approach significantly
reduces the number of contigs compared to de novo assemblers. While it
introduces a small increase in inaccuracies, such as false joins, our
optimisation-based methods are competitive with current exhaustive search
techniques. They are also designed to scale more efficiently as the problem
size grows and will run effectively on future quantum computers.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling is a central technique in quantum computing for actively
suppressing decoherence and systematic imperfections through sequences of
single-qubit operations. Conventional sequences typically aim to completely
freeze system dynamics, often resulting in long protocols whose length scales
exponentially with system size. In this work, we introduce a general framework
for constructing time-optimal, selectively-tailored sequences that remove only
specific local interactions. By combining techniques from graph coloring and
classical coding theory, our approach enables compact and hardware-tailored
sequences across diverse qubit platforms, efficiently canceling undesired
Hamiltonian terms while preserving target interactions. This opens up broad
applications in quantum computing and simulation. At the core of our method is
a mapping between dynamical decoupling sequence design and error-detecting
codes, which allows us to leverage powerful coding-theoretic tools to construct
customized sequences. To overcome exponential overheads, we exploit symmetries
in colored interaction hypergraphs, extending graph-coloring strategies to
arbitrary many-body Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework through concrete examples, including compact sequences that suppress
residual ZZ and ZZZ interactions in superconducting qubits and Heisenberg
exchange coupling in spin qubits. We also show how it enables Hamiltonian
engineering by simulating the anisotropic Kitaev honeycomb model using only
isotropic Heisenberg interactions.

### [126] [Average Contraction Coefficients of Quantum Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08214)
*Ruben Ibarrondo,Daniel Stilck França*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces new measures of contraction for quantum channels that capture typical behavior instead of worst-case scenarios, leading to phase transitions depending on noise strength and depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is inspired by the data-processing inequality and seeks to refine our understanding of quantum channel behavior beyond worst-case analysis.

Method: The authors analyze contraction coefficients by studying moments of contraction for quantum divergences, relate these for different divergences, and derive bounds using channel properties like entropy and purity. They focus on trace distance for specific results involving phase transitions in noise channels and random quantum circuits.

Result: The research establishes phase transitions in average contraction: at low noise, contraction remains high; above a critical threshold, it decays exponentially. These findings are extended to random quantum circuits, showing behavior dependent on circuit depth. Additionally, the paper applies its methods to differential privacy, revealing trade-offs between privacy and average indistinguishability.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed framework for understanding typical quantum channel behavior, offering new insights into contraction phenomena and their applications in privacy and computation.

Abstract: The data-processing inequality ensures quantum channels reduce state
distinguishability, with contraction coefficients quantifying optimal bounds.
However, these can be overly optimistic and not representative of the usual
behavior. We study how noise contracts distinguishability of `typical' states,
beyond the worst-case. To that end, we introduce and study a family of moments
of contraction for quantum divergences, which interpolate between the
worst-case contraction coefficient of a channel and its average behavior under
a chosen ensemble of input states. We establish general properties of these
moments, relate moments for different divergences, and derive bounds in terms
of channel parameters like the entropy or purity of its Choi state.
  Focusing on the trace distance, we obtain upper and lower bounds on its
average contraction under tensor-product noise channels, and prove that,
depending on the local noise strength, there is a phase transition in the limit
of many channel uses: below a critical error rate the average contraction
remains near unity, whereas above it decays exponentially with system size. We
extend these phase-transition phenomena to random quantum circuits with unital
noise, showing that constant-depth noisy circuits do not shrink the trace
distance on average, even when given highly entangled states as input. In
contrast, even at $\log\log n$ depth, the average trace distance can become
superpolynomially small.
  Finally, we explore moments of contraction for f-divergences and discuss
applications to local differential privacy, demonstrating that noise regimes
ensuring privacy can render outputs essentially indistinguishable on average.
Thus, our results provide a fine-grained framework to quantify typical channel
noise in quantum information and computation and unveil new phenomena in
contraction coefficients, such as phase transitions for average contraction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The simulation of electronic systems is an anticipated application for
quantum-centric computers, i.e. heterogeneous architectures where classical and
quantum processing units operate in concert. An important application is the
computation of radical chain reactions, including those responsible for the
photodegradation of composite materials used in aerospace engineering. Here, we
compute the activation energy and reaction energy for hydrogen abstraction from
2,2-diphenyldipropane, used as a minimal model for a step in a radical chain
reaction. Calculations are performed using a superconducting quantum processor
of the IBM Heron family and classical computing resources. To this end, we
combine a qubit-reduction technique called entanglement forging (EF) with
sample based quantum diagonalization (SQD), a method that projects the
Schr\"{o}dinger equation into a subspace of configurations sampled from a
quantum device. In conventional quantum simulations, a qubit represents a
spin-orbital. In contrast, EF maps a qubit to a spatial orbital, reducing the
required number of qubits by half. We provide a complete derivation and a
detailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its
accuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.

### [129] [Composable Quantum Fault-Tolerance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08246)
*Zhiyang He,Quynh T. Nguyen,Christopher A. Pattison*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces composable fault-tolerance as a framework for proving threshold theorems in quantum computing, allowing modular and rigorous threshold proofs by composing gadgets without needing complex probabilistic noise models. It provides a library of standard gadgets and demonstrates their use in threshold proofs for surface codes and Gottesman's scheme.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proving threshold theorems in quantum computing is complicated, and combining elements from different papers into a single proof is difficult. This paper aims to simplify this process by introducing a new framework, composable fault-tolerance.

Method: The authors developed a framework called composable fault-tolerance that separates noise distribution analysis from circuit correctness analysis, enabling modular threshold proofs. They created a library of gadgets for quantum error correction codes and applied these to demonstrate threshold proofs for specific quantum computing techniques.

Result: The framework simplifies proving threshold theorems by allowing independent analysis of components and provides ready-to-use gadgets. They demonstrated this by showing threshold proofs for surface codes and Gottesman's constant space overhead scheme.

Conclusion: The new framework and library of gadgets make proving fault-tolerance more manageable by focusing on novel techniques while relying on the framework for standard components, leading to more intuitive proofs.

Abstract: Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a
burdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively
formulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from
multiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of
different measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable
fault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the
noise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and
enables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and
rigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and
commonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth
circuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample
applications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with
surface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of
Gottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future
fault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while
leaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework,
with the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Carrollian holography is a framework for flat space holography. This paper defines Carrollian amplitudes for massless scalar fields and provides explicit expressions for two-, three-, and four-point functions. They show these amplitudes relate to Lorentzian holographic correlators in AdS/CFT and derive celestial amplitudes in D dimensions.Overall, the paper connects these holographic concepts across different spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding holographic principles in various spacetime geometries is crucial for developing a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. This paper aims to bridge flat space and celestial holography using Carrollian amplitudes, offering new tools to explore these relationships.

Method: The authors define Carrollian amplitudes for massless scalars in general dimensions. They compute two-, three-, and four-point functions and explore their connection to AdS/CFT and celestial holography.

Result: They successfully compute and express the early computed amplitudes, demonstrating their relation to AdS/CFT and celestial holography. This provides new insights into holographic correspondence in flat space and celestial settings.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to connecting flat space holography with celestial holography, offering a framework to study quantum gravity through these holographic dualities.

Abstract: Carrollian holography is a framework for flat space holography, suggesting
that gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime in $D$ dimensions is dual to a
conformal Carrollian field theory in $D - 1$ dimensions living at null
infinity. In this work, we elaborate on the definition of Carrollian amplitudes
for massless scalar fields in general dimensions and provide explicit
expressions for the two-, three-, and four-point functions. We show that these
amplitudes naturally arise from Lorentzian holographic correlators in AdS/CFT
through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the
Carrollian limit at the boundary. Finally, we use the relation between
Carrollian and celestial holography to derive explicit expressions for
celestial amplitudes in $D$ dimensions, which are reinterpreted as correlators
of the celestial CFT in $D - 2$ dimensions.

TL;DR: The paper presents a matrix model approach to study Liouville conformal blocks involving degenerate and irregular operators. The model uses a β-deformed Hermitian matrix with a potential degree matching the irregular operator's degree. Conformal blocks are linked to WZW models under a constraint, satisfying modified KZ equations. The response combines this model with generalized resolvents for realization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To gain a deeper understanding of conformal field theories and matrix models, particularly through the lens of Liouville theory and its applications in string theory or quantum gravity.

Method: The papers employ matrix model techniques, β-deformed measures, conformal constraints, and link them to WZW models and KZ equations.

Result: They derive matrix integral representations for irregular conformal blocks and connect to KZ equations in modified forms.

Conclusion: The results provide a powerful tool for analyzing and computing Liouville conformal blocks with irregular operators.

Abstract: In this paper we study matrix model realizations of Liouville conformal
blocks with degenerate and irregular operators. The corresponding matrix model
is Hermitian with a $\beta$-deformed measure and the degree of the potential
corresponds to the degree of the irregular operator in the CFT conformal block.
We then show how such matrix integrals can be obtained from an
$SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ WZW model with a conformal constraint giving rise to
Liouville theory. The corresponding conformal blocks satisfy irregular versions
of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations and we provide a matrix model
realization in terms of generalized resolvents.

It examines how these operators, inspired by previous work by Kirillov and Noumi, function within different algebraic structures such as the W_{1+	imes} algebra and the affine Yangian Y(gl_1). The study likely contributes to understanding the non-commuting nature of these operators and their applications in representation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of creation operators and their applications in representation theory is fundamental, especially concerning symmetric functions like Schur, Jack, and Macdonald polynomials. This abstract suggests it offers a deeper understanding of operator commutativity and their role in algebraic structures like W-algebras and affine Yangians.

Method: The authors delve into constructing the creation operators in various algebraic settings, including the matrix and Fock representations of W_{1+	imes} and Y(gl_1). They likely employ representation theory techniques and operator algebra methods to build and analyze these operators in different contexts.

Result: The paper probably results in a better understanding of how non-commuting creation operators behave in the specified algebras, contributing to the combinatorial and algebraic structures of symmetric function theory.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that by studying these creation operators in diverse algebraic frameworks, it enhances our grasp on their properties and interactions, which is crucial for advancing both representation theory and the theory of symmetric functions.

Abstract: We reconsider in modern terms the old discovery by A. Kirillov and M. Noumi,
who devised peculiar operators adding columns to Young diagrams enumerating the
Schur, Jack and Macdonald polynomials. In this sense, these are a kind of
``creation'' operators, representing Pieri rules in a maximally simple form,
when boxes are added to Young diagrams in a regular way and not to arbitrary
``empty places'' around the diagram. Instead the operators do not commute, and
one should add columns of different lengths one after another. We consider this
construction in different contexts. In particular, we build up the creation
operators $\hat B_m$ in the matrix and Fock representations of the
$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra, and in the Fock representation of the affine Yangian
algebra $Y(\widehat{gl}_1)$.

*Gleb Arutyunov,Lukas Hardi*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper addresses the quantization of the rational spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider model using quantum Hamiltonian reduction, identifies associated algebraic structures, and conjectures a connection to affine Yangians in a particle limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on an important problem in mathematical physics involving the quantization of a specific integrable system, the rational spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. This model is known for its relevance in various areas of theoretical physics, including quantum mechanics and integrable systems. The motivation behind the study is likely to advance our understanding of how to quantize such systems and possibly uncover deeper algebraic structures like quantum groups or Yangians that underpin them.

Method: The authors employ quantum Hamiltonian reduction, a technique used to construct quantum algebras from classical ones, specifically applied to a framed Jordan quiver. They construct a quantized quiver variety, which serves as the algebra of quantum observables for the model. This setup allows them to identify loop algebras and Yangians within the constructed algebra, leading to conjectures about these structures in the limit of a large number of particles.

Result: The authors successfully quantize the model using their method, identify the presence of loop algebras and Yangians, conjecturing that these structures become shifted affine Yangians in the limit. They also derive a difference equation for eigenstates of the lowest Hamiltonian, which reduces to a known result when the spin polarization is trivial (ℓ=1). This result not only confirms conjectures about the quantum algebra structure but also provides a concrete mathematical framework for further analysis of the model.

Conclusion: The paper contributes significantly to the understanding of the quantization of the rational spin Ruijsenaars-Schneider model by utilizing quantum Hamiltonian reduction. It provides a clear identification of the underlying algebraic structures and posits a connection to affine Yangians, offering a solid foundation for future research in this area. The derived equations for eigenstates further validate the theoretical framework and suggest potential applications in related fields of theoretical physics.

Abstract: This paper tackles the long-standing problem of quantizing the rational spin
Ruijsenaars--Schneider model originating in the work of Krichever and Zabrodin.
We make use of the technique of quantum Hamiltonian reduction to construct a
quantized quiver variety $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ associated to the framed
Jordan quiver. This quantized quiver variety is simultaneously the algebra of
quantum observables of the rational spin Ruijsenaars--Schneider model of $N$
particles with $\ell$ spin polarizations. Inside this algebra, we find a loop
algebra and Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}_\ell$ and conjecture that in the limit of
infinitely many particles, the algebra $\mathfrak{A}_{N,\ell}$ becomes a
shifted affine Yangian. We also exhibit a difference equation for eigenstates
of the lowest Hamiltonian that reduces to the spinless case when $\ell=1$.

*So Katagiri*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new supersymmetric matrix model for M2-branes in M-theory. It uses Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD) symmetry to reformulate the supermembrane action with Nambu brackets, allowing matrix regularization that preserves key symmetries and classifications BPS configurations. This provides a foundation for matrix models of higher-dimensional branes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be advancing the understanding of matrix models in string theory, specifically in the context of M2-branes. It appears to introduce a novel approach using Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations symmetry, which could be significant for preserving certain properties like Lorentz covariance during regularization. The focus on BPS configurations also suggests it could provide insights into stable states in M-theory.

Method: The method involves constructing a supersymmetric Lorentz-covariant matrix model using Nambu brackets and RVPD symmetry. The model Regularizes the supermembrane action by decomposing Nambu brackets into Poisson brackets, which allows for consistent matrix regularization preserving the Fundamental Identity and Lorentz covariance. The paper identifies $	ilde{	heta}$-symmetry and uses the algebra to classify BPS states based on their dimensional reductions.

Result: The model successfully reformulates the supermembrane action with Nambu brackets, enabling a matrix regularization that preserves crucial symmetries. It classifies various BPS configurations, including those in different dimensions, and suggests potential applications for higher-dimensional branes like M5-branes.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in the development of Lorentz-covariant matrix models, particularly for M2-branes. By leveraging RVPD symmetry and Nambu brackets, the authors construct a model that maintains key symmetries necessary for matrix regularization and offers a systematic classification of BPS states, paving the way for exploring higher-dimensional branes in M-theory.

Abstract: We present a novel supersymmetric Lorentz-covariant matrix model for
M2-branes in M-theory, constructed via the framework of Restricted
Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD) which is a residual symmetry from
gauge-fixed volume-preserving diffeomorphisms. The model reformulates the
supermembrane action entirely in terms of Nambu brackets, whose decomposition
into Poisson brackets allows for a consistent matrix regularization that
preserves both the Fundamental Identity and Lorentz covariance. Under the RVPD
gauge structure, $\kappa$-symmetry is reduced to a restricted form
($\tilde{\kappa}$) that closes with RVPD transformations into a novel symmetry
algebra. This algebra enables a systematic classification of BPS
configurations: particle states (1/2-BPS), noncommutative membranes (1/4-BPS),
and extended configurations in 4, 6, and 8 dimensions (1/8-, 1/16-, and
1/32-BPS), while the 10-dimensional case is non-BPS. The construction provides
a natural lift of D2-brane matrix theory to M-theory and offers a pathway
toward Lorentz-covariant matrix models for higher branes such as M5-branes.

Abstract: Black holes, like any other object - respond to external fields like
background electric and gravitational fields. At lowest order, the response of
a black hole to, (e.g.) a gravitational wave in the $l^{th}$ spherical harmonic
mode is to develop a generalized `quadrupole moment' in the same symmetry
channel. The induced moment of the black hole is proportional to the external
forcing field. The constant of proportionality between the field and the
response is a function of the frequency $\omega$ of the incident perturbation.
These constants of proportionality are sometimes called `Love' numbers in the
study of astrophysical black holes. Using the `Large $D$ Membrane Paradigm'
formalism, we compute gravitostatic black hole `Love' numbers (at $\omega \to
0$ limit), in large $D$. This work opens the road of using Large $D$ Membrane
Paradigm formalism to extend the computation of these black hole `Love' numbers
for all values of $\omega$ in large $D$ - which we announce in this paper.

Abstract: We explore the microstructure of asymptotically flat charged black holes
through the lens of nonextensive R\'enyi statistics. A modified form of the
R\'enyi entropy is proposed to incorporate compressibility effects, and
geometrothermodynamics is applied within such a framework. Besides, by
quantizing the black hole horizon area, we derive a microscopic description in
terms of discrete degrees of freedom, with R\'enyi entropy providing a
nonextensive generalization of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compute the
R\'enyi partition function and probability distribution in the canonical
ensemble, highlighting significant deviations from Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior at
finite temperature due to nonextensive effects. The black hole undergoes a
first-order Van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large
configurations, characterized by discontinuities in entropy and latent heat,
both of which are shown to depend on the number of area quanta. A critical
threshold emerges beyond which the transition becomes athermal. Additionally,
we establish a thermodynamic duality between charged-AdS black holes in
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and charged-flat R\'enyi black holes, expressed via
a conformal transformation of state variables. This duality extends naturally
to higher dimensions. Our results provide new insights into the microstructure
of black holes.

Abstract: We investigate boson stars in an $O(3)$ scalar field theory with a
symmetry-breaking potential. By constructing numerically spherically symmetric
solutions, we demonstrate that the model gives rise to a rich set of field
configurations. The negative coupling constant of the scalar self-interactions
allows for two types of boson stars: Type I solutions represent the usual boson
stars, that emerge from the vacuum as the boson frequency is decreased below
the boson mass, whereas type II boson stars emerge from a set of static soliton
solutions. Depending on the strengths of the gravitational and the electric
coupling constants, both types or only one type is present. At a critical set
of coupling constants, both types undergo a bifurcation. There the spirals of
both types disconnect from their branches and reconnect with each other, while
the remaining branches of both types also reconnect with each other.

The Kallen-Lehmann decomposition is a representation of Green's functions in terms of spectral densities, so the paper likely aims to provide new tools for analyzing quantum fields in these spaces. The use of one-loop self-energy calculations in a Yukawa model indicates they're looking at corrections to propagators, which are fundamental in renormalization and scattering theory.

Method: The authors derive compact formulas using harmonic decomposition in AdS and dS, translating the products of spinor and scalar harmonics into Kallen-Lehmann forms. They validate the flat space limit by comparing results, and for the dS case, they simplify one-loop calculations related to the self-energy using spectral equations.

Result: Compacted expressions for Kallen-Lehmann decompositions in AdS and dS are presented. The flat space limit is shown to be correct, establishing a bridge between these spacetimes. A simplified spectral approach for one-loop self-energies in the dS Yukawa model is introduced, facilitating calculations.

Conclusion: The paper successfully derives compact Kallen-Lehmann formulas, validates their equivalence to flat space limits, and introduces new spectral methods for loop computations. This work provides new tools for studying quantum fields in AdS and dS geometries, which are crucial for both theoretical physics and potential applications in cosmology.

Abstract: Compact formulas (1), (28) presented in this paper permit to formulate the
Kallen-Lehmann harmonic decompositions of the products of two spinor and of
spinor and scalar harmonic functions in AdS and Wightman functions in dS
spaces; the correct flat space limit of the corresponding Kallen-Lehmann
densities is demonstrated. Also in Sec. 4 the relatively simple, suitable for
calculations Kallen-Lehmann representations of the real parts of spinor and
scalar one-loop self-energies in Yukawa model in dS space-time are proposed,
and corresponding spectral equations in the chain approximation are written
down.

Abstract: We argue that the special extremal slice inside an AdS black hole is dual to
an absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. We demonstrate this by
confirming the $n$-independence of holographic $n$-th Renyi entropies for any
bi-partite subsystems. Our result gives an AME state in an infinite-volume
system, where the local bond dimension is set by the black hole entropy. In
particular, our construction provides concrete support from the gravity side
for the emergence of random structures and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert
space in recent non-isometric holographic codes.

### [141] [Time Ordering Effects and Destruction of Quasiparticles in Two-dimensional Holographic CFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07645)
*Weibo Mao,Masahiro Nozaki*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores how composite operator evolutions affect entanglement dynamics in 2D holographic CFTs, finding significant dependence on energy distribution and quasiparticle decay. It establishes a connection between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities, particularly at late times. The results suggest that the time ordering of different evolution operators influences entanglement and correlation behaviors. The gravity dual analysis further supports these findings by linking them to gravitational physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding entanglement dynamics in higher-dimensional systems can be complex, but using holographic models and gravitational duality may simplify these investigations, especially in 2D. This paper addresses this by focusing on composite operators and their effects on entanglement and correlations.

Method: The study involves analyzing entanglement entropy and non-local correlations, deriving the late-time behavior by examining energy-momentum densities through gravitational duals. The methodology likely includes numerical simulations or analytical calculations based on conformal field theory and holography.

Result: The key findings are that bipartite entanglement and non-local correlations depend heavily on the energy distribution and the decay of quasiparticles, with specific relations established between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum. These behaviors are particularly pronounced at late times, where their asymptotic trends are determined by the gravitational duals associated with the 2D holographic CFTs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that composite operator evolutions lead to distinct entanglement and correlation patterns influenced by energy distribution and quasiparticle decay. The gravitational duality provides a comprehensive framework to analyze and predict these behaviors, offering insights into high-energy or late-time phenomena in holographic conformal field theories.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics induced by a
composite operator, defined as the local operator evolved with the time
evolution operator constructed of the Euclidean and Lorentzian ones. The
systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic
conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by
gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time
evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local
correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation
between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation
states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local
correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the
decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local
correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems
considered in this paper.

Conclusion: 这种方法为探索5D和6D理论提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: We study Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries for rank-two theories, encompassing
4D field theories as well as 5D and 6D Kaluza-Klein (KK) theories. The singular
model for each SW geometry is derived from a one-parameter family of algebraic
curves $y^2 = f(x,t)$, where $t$ parametrizes one dimension of Coulomb branch
moduli space. The functional form of $f(x,t)$ is systematically determined
through analysis of singular fibers at $t=\infty$. Two powerful computational
methods enable this determination: a): Liu's algorithm for determining singular
fibers from local equation; b): The canonical resolution method for fiber
degeneration. Our construction provides not only a complete description of
known solutions but also establishes a robust framework for generating new
theories. This methodology proves particularly valuable for the systematic
exploration of 5D and 6D theories.

Abstract: We consider supersymmetric solutions of $D=5$ Euclidean gauged supergravity

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We initiate the study of flux tubes in confining gauge theories placed in a
rigid AdS background, which serves as an infrared regulator. Varying the AdS
radius from large to small allows us to interpolate between the flat space
confining string, and a weakly coupled string-like object which is held
together by the AdS gravitational potential. At any radius, the string
preserves a subgroup of AdS isometries equivalent to the one-dimensional
conformal group and hence, from the boundary point of view, can be thought of
as a conformal defect. The defect hosts a protected operator, called
displacement, which nonlinearly realizes the broken AdS isometries. At small
radius the displacement corresponds to the gauge field strength inserted at the
boundary, while at large radius it is mapped to the Goldstone mode living on
the string worldsheet. This relates gauge field and worldsheet degrees of
freedom. We propose a hypothesis according to which the large and small radius
perturbative expansions can be smoothly matched with each other. As a test, we
calculate the leading order corrections to the scaling dimensions and OPE
coefficients of a set of defect operators at weak coupling in planar 3D
Yang-Mills.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of black hole critical collapse in the limit of a
large number of spacetime dimensions, $D$. In particular, we study the
spherical gravitational collapse of a massless, scale-invariant scalar field
with continuous self-similarity (CSS). The large number of dimensions provides
a natural separation of scales, simplifying the equations of motion at each
scale where different effects dominate. With this approximation scheme, we
construct matched asymptotic solutions for this family, including the critical
solution. We then compute the mass critical exponent of the black hole for
linear perturbations that break CSS, finding that it asymptotes to a constant
value in infinite dimensions. Additionally, we present a link between these
solutions and closed Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW)
cosmologies with a dimension-dependent equation of state and cosmological
constant. The critical solution corresponds to an unstable Einstein-like
universe, while subcritical and supercritical solutions correspond to bouncing
and crunching cosmologies respectively. Our results provide a proof of concept
for the large-$D$ expansion as a powerful analytic tool in gravitational
collapse and suggest potential extensions to other self-similar systems.

Conclusion: 该模型展示了无质量分立子量子磁性液体的存在。这个发现推动了分立子磁性的研究。

Abstract: Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by
higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter
excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no
spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize
these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we
investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a
fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering.
Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of
suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1)
field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1
spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is
not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy
sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.

Conclusion: 分形电弦液体的量子化效应受分裂状态严重限制，建议增大小自旋值以促进操控。

Abstract: Classical U(1) fracton spin liquids feature an extensive ground state
degeneracy and follow an effective description in terms of a tensor Gauss' law
where charges, so-called fractons, have restricted mobility. Here we introduce
a simple spin model that realizes such a state by straightforward
discretization of the higher-rank gauge theory on a square lattice. The
simplicity of this construction offers direct insights into the system's
fundamental fractonic properties, such as real-space fracton configurations,
height-field representation of the classical ground state manifold as well as
properties of local and non-local fluctuations within the fracton-free
subspace. By sampling classical Ising states from the extensive ground state
manifold, we show that the effective tensor Gauss' law remains intact when
explicitly enforcing the spin-1/2 length constraint, demonstrating the
existence of a classical Ising fracton spin liquid. However, we observe that
perturbative quantum effects are insufficient to efficiently tunnel between
classical ground states, leading to severe Hilbert space fragmentation which
obscures fractonic quantum behavior. Specifically, by simulating the spin-1/2
quantum model with Green function Monte Carlo as a function of the
Rokhsar-Kivelson potential, we find that the system supports either magnetic
long-range order or a classical spin liquid. Our findings highlight the crucial
role of Hilbert-space fragmentation in fractonic spin systems but also indicate
ways to mitigate such effects via increasing the spin magnitude to $S=1$,
investigated in a companion paper.

### [148] [Defect Networks for Topological Phases Protected By Modulated Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06604)

TL;DR: The paper discusses topological phases in physics by introducing a new concept called modulated symmetries, which do not commute with spatial symmetries. The authors create a general method using a defect network construction to build these topological phases and apply this method to classify specific dimensions, resulting in new classifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in expanding the understanding of topological phases by incorporating non-commuting symmetries, which could lead to new states of matter not previously accounted for. This could have implications for quantum materials and future technologies.

Method: The authors use a method that generalizes the crystalline equivalence principle. They introduce a defect network construction to encode topological phases protected by modulated symmetries and analyze how these symmetries affect defect networks, leading to classifications in lower dimensions.

Result: The main results include classifications of symmetry-protected topological phases in (1+1)D and (2+1)D when combined with specific types of dipolar symmetries, highlighting anomalies introduced by modulated symmetries compared to unmodulated ones. These findings offer a framework for further exploration of new topological states.

Conclusion: The paper opens up new avenues in condensed matter physics by introducing modulated symmetries and their implications for topological phases. It contributes to the theoretical classification of materials and paves the way for potential technological innovations based on these new states of matter.

Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with
spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general
recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries
via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence
principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can
be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial
symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks
which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for
modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify
symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus
either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and
obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated
symmetry-protected topological phases.

Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for
exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism
remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix
renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard
model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our
results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals:
while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer
antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows
exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order
in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for
forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and
Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the
trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model,
providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer
and bilayer nickelates.

Motivation: The importance of flat band materials in condensed matter physics, their role in exploring exotic quantum phases, and the need for a comprehensive review that ties together theory and experiment.

Method: The paper reviews theoretical frameworks, discusses mathematical models like Lieb and Kagome lattices, and explores experimental findings while introducing numerical methods for studying these systems.

Result: Summarizes recent research findings on flat bands, highlights their applications in exotic phases like unconventional superconductivity, and presents computational tools used to study them.

Conclusion:  flat band materials present a unique platform for studying topological, geometric, and correlated electronic effects, offering insights into novel quantum phenomena and guiding future research directions in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it
gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy,
quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their
experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold
atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more
recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy
scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize
and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic
correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional
superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review
presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material
realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the
origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical
lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries.
Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and
theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non
perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band
materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this
review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body
phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic
spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band
structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications
without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a
two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The
interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex
symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent
components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization,
which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an
in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a
polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the
polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong
anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings
suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems
via electric and optical means.

Conclusion: FePd2Te2 is a promising thermoelectric material for spintronic use.

Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric effect enables simpler, more flexible
thermoelectric devices by generating electricity perpendicular to heat flow,
offering promising solutions for waste heat recovery and solid-state cooling
applications. Here, we report a striking observation of zero-field anomalous
Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) below TC in the
two-dimensional metallic magnet FePd2Te2. The anomalous Nernst signal Syx^A
peaks a maximum value of 0.15 {\mu}V/K at 100 K, much larger than that of
conventional FM materials. Remarkably, the derived ratio alpha_ij/sigma_ij in
FePd2Te2 approaches the fundamental limit of 86 {\mu}V/K. Our findings suggest
a dominant Berry curvature contribution to the ANE. The observed giant
zero-field anomalous Nernst response in 2D FePd2Te2 not only advances
fundamental understanding of transverse thermoelectricity in layered magnets,
but also provides this material as a promising candidate for practical
thermoelectric spintronic applications.

Conclusion: 为Q峰的利用提供了新的理论和技术框架，突破了历史上的限制，进一步扩展了 Valleytronics 的潜在应用。

Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of
valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$
and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However,
direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible
valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an
outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full
valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically
introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables
deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in
monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with
a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that
unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely
decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This
all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across
an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to
petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley
polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm
of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the
$\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information
processing.

Abstract: Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap
phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization.
However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly
understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and
$^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific
heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study
unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales
which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge
carriers: thermally activated transport ($T>150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott
variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with
Coulomb gap formation ($T<50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking
divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate,
$(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field,
indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported
by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap
phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the
emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson
insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.

*Yanzhang Zhu,Zenan Liu,Zhe Wang,Yan-Cheng Wang,Zheng Yan*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Connections between many-body entanglement and surface criticality were made to reveal the behavior of entanglement entropy in various bipartitions at the SO(5) DQCP, showing that some assumptions about which bipartition reflects the bulk criticality may not hold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract discusses a controversy in recent works about scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) DQCP, and this paper aims to reconcile these findings by connecting many-body entanglement with surface criticality.

Method: The work connects many-body entanglement concepts with surface criticality by studying the behavior of entanglement entropy in different bipartitions, specifically at the SO(5) DQCP. They found that the entanglement spectrum's correspondence with the edge energy spectrum still holds at a bulk critical point, affecting entropy behavior.

Result: The study reveals that certain bipartitions may not accurately reflect the criticality of the bulk, challenging previous assumptions about which partitions correspond to the bulk.

Conclusion: This paper helps resolve the controversy by showing that the relationship between entanglement and surface criticality is more nuanced than previously thought, especially regarding which bipartitions capture bulk properties accurately.

Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5)
deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different
bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is a
unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously
disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality
-- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite
scenarios, and point out what kind of bipartition truly reflects the
criticality of the bulk. We have found that the correspondence between the
entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still persists even at a
bulk-gapless point (e.g. critical point), thereby influencing the behavior of
entanglement entropy.

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant
metal-insulator transition and crossover between strongly correlated line-graph
lattices (Lieb and Kagome). Using a non-perturbative numerical approach, we
demonstrate for the first time that an applied shear strain stabilizes a
metallic phase cradled in between a gapped magnetic insulator and a gapless
flat band localized insulator, facilitating the Lieb/Kagome interconversion.
Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for
electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of
non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to
quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.

Abstract: The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets
orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a
canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the
framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory.
However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of
charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet
(S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$
centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons
moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of
freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making
use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective
field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases,
high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron
and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin
density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin
value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features
of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.

Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when
applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the
structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled,
antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show
that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a
structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed
through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a
shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed
magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition.
Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders
of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial
enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a
highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that
the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy,
underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis
as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in
strongly correlated materials.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex
phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we
study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes
affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of
the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the
limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For
moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state
emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of
interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase
inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case --
namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a
wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$.
Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral
weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that
near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified
spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the
$J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.

*Masashi Kumazaki,Azimjon Temurjonov,Yukihiro Watanabe,Taku Matsuhita,Yoshiaki Kobayashi,Yasuhiro Shimizu*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable bulk magnetism observations. Site-selective NMR shows local spin susceptibilities, with cancellation of staggered fields at the Bi layer. In-plane fields yield cubic temperature dependence, while out-of-plane fields show increased spin relaxation, indicative of quantum Hall-like behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on a specific magnetic material, BaMnBi2, to study its magnetic properties related to three-dimensional Dirac semimetals, which are of significant interest due to their unique electronic and magnetic characteristics. The use of NMR spectroscopy, a precise tool, provides insights into the local spin dynamics and the presence of quantum phases such as the Dirac semimetal and quantum Hall effects.

Method: The authors employed site-selective NMR spectroscopy to probe the local static and dynamic spin susceptibility of BaMnBi2. This method allows for the detailed mapping of magnetic properties at the atomic level. They applied both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields to the material and analyzed the corresponding nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates, 1/T1, to understand the temperature-dependent behavior and the occurrence of quantum phase transitions.

Result: The study reveals that the anti-ferromagnetic Mn moments generate cancellations of the staggered fields at the Bi layer. Under an in-plane field, the relaxation rate 1/T1 follows the cubic dependence, indicating ideal Dirac fermion behavior with the chemical potential near the Dirac point. Conversely, under an out-of-plane field, 1/T1 becomes nearly constant at low temperatures and increases significantly beyond 100 times when the material enters the quantum Hall regime.

Conclusion: These findings validate the presence of three-dimensional Dirac semimetallic behavior in BaMnBi2 and demonstrate the effective exploration of local spin dynamics through NMR spectroscopy. The results further elucidate the handedness-dependent quantum Hall effect and propose the material as a potential platform for studying gapless Dirac fermions and related quantum phenomena.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable the observation of bulk magnetism
in topological quantum phases. We report site-selective NMR spectroscopy that
probes local static and dynamic spin susceptibility on the magnetic semimetal
BaMnBi$_2$. We find that spontaneous staggered fields from antiferromagnetic Mn
moments are completely canceled at the Bi layer hosting Dirac fermions. In an
in-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the
cubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac
semimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane
field, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears,
and is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field. The
result demonstrates a condensation of quantized Dirac fermions in the quantum
Hall regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I am curious about how quantum circuits behave outside of Fermi-liquid theory and whether these generalized relations can be applied in simulations.

Method: The authors studied a two-site charge Kondo circuit to analyze the Cutler-Mott relations in both operating regimes of the system.

Result: The generalized relations hold smooth across temperature regimes, aiding figure-of-merit computations for non-Fermi liquids.

Conclusion: Applicability of generalized relations for non-Fermi simulation is discussed, though I want more details on experimental validation and practical applications.

Abstract: We analyze the validity of the Cutler-Mott relations outside the Landau
Fermi-liquid concept. We consider a two-site charge Kondo circuit as a
paradigmatic example of a system possessing both Fermi- and non-Fermi liquid
properties. It is shown that the generalized Cutler-Mott-like relations derived
in the paper hold in both operating regimes of the charge Kondo quantum circuit
describing a smooth crossover between low- and high- temperature regimes. We
discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a
figure of merit of the non-Fermi liquid quantum simulators.

TL;DR: 研究分析了不同相互作用情况下自旋液态与自旋玻璃态之间的关系，发现通过调整相互作用的维数可以统一不同情况的相图，并且增强各向异性会减小自旋液态的存续范围，主要分布在自旋玻璃态附近。此外，引入外磁场时，自旋液态在比预期更早地转变为自旋玻璃态，进入无序磁性相。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者们试图理解量子磁性系统中的自旋液态和自旋玻璃态的相变规律，这在统计物理和量子磁性领域很重要，因为这些状态揭示了不同的量子无序状态。

Method: 研究者构建了一个包含p自旋之间相互作用的无序模型，其中相互作用可以调整不同维度的自旋态，通过分析系统大小N依赖下的Edwards-Anderson参数和能级密度，得出了不同p值下的相变线及其相图。他们通过将不同p值的相图按N/p²缩放，统一了不同维度互作用下的相图，并发现更高的各向异性会导致自旋液态的存在区域缩小。此外，在存在外磁场的情况下，发现自旋液态会在更早的阶段发生向自旋玻璃态的转变，并进入无序磁性相。

Result: 在不同的多相作用中，自旋液态和自旋玻璃态的相变规律被系统性地研究，否定了早期某些关于互相作用维数无关的假设。他们通过张量互作用调整补给不同维度的自旋态，并通过缩放得出了统一的相图。尤其是，在主轴对称的互作用下，自旋液态的维持范围随着各向异性的增加而缩小。同时，当施加外磁场时，自旋液态会在较低的场强就开始转变向自旋玻璃态，并进一步扩展到了磁性无序相。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，调整自旋系统中相互作用的维度和各向异性参数对三维自旋液体和二维自旋玻璃体的相变关系有着显著的影响，利用多维相互作用的无序模型，可以统一不同相互作用性质下的相图，并通过分析系统性质和晶格尺寸关系来界定相变线。这些发现为理解自旋液体和自旋玻璃体的无序相变机制提供了重要的理论支持，并可能为后续开发具有不同量子磁性特性的材料体系创造了基础。

Abstract: Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered
quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by
quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state
and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we
systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass
states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which
interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and
isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of
the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the
transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We
show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling
with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions
systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass
regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin
interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic
case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase
before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights
into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new framework for constructing exactly solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological phases, utilizing an enlarged string-net model. It discusses two methods for promoting a unitary fusion category to a symmetric fusion category, leading to models with intrinsic symmetries. A key contribution is the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase. Motivation: The rise of quantum materials and the interest in topological phases. Method: Uses string-net models and group theory. Results: Explicit model for S_3 symmetry. Conclusion: New framework for symmetry-enriched topological phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need to model symmetry-enhanced phases of matter, a significant area in condensed matter physics, especially with the discovery of new quantum materials. Understanding and characterizing these phases helps in explaining exotic quantum phenomena and could lead to new applications in quantum computing and materials science. Previous work in this area has provided foundational models, but this paper takes a step further by offering a systematic framework, potentially enabling a broader range of applications and theoretical insights.

Method: The authors utilize the string-net model, a mathematical framework for describing topological phases of matter, and enhance it by introducing global symmetries. They employ techniques from group theory and category theory to construct models that incorporate these symmetries, leading to models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases. The method involves promoting a unitary fusion category to a symmetric one, utilizing two complementary strategies related to outer automorphisms and Frobenius algebras.

Result: The primary result is the construction of an explicit lattice model realizing a nonabelian S_3 symmetry-enriched Z_2 x Z_2 quantum-double phase. This is the first explicit model of its kind, providing a concrete example that can be used for further theoretical analysis and practical applications. Additionally, the paper explores the role of local excitations and their symmetry constraints, contributing to a deeper understanding of the structure of SET phases.

Conclusion: This paper offers a significant advancement in modeling symmetry-enriched topological phases by introducing a systematic framework. The work is expected to deepen the understanding of topological phases of matter and aid in theoretical predictions and experimental designs related to these exotic states of matter.

Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice
models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged
version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET
models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking
externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the
string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary
fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion
category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction
strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer
automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of
$\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are
intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as
opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological
phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological
phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach,
we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a
nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched
$\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further
reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their
symmetry constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding systems with multiple ligand interactions is crucial for various applications like immunotherapy and synthetic biology, hence the motivation to explore their steady states and stability.

Method: The approach likely involves mathematical modeling and analysis, possibly using differential equations to describe the binding processes and their dynamics over time.

Result: The system exhibits unique steady states within each conservation class, which are asymptotically stable. The steady-state behavior is successfully modeled, and the dependence of the fully bound complex on total scaffold concentration is quantified.

### [166] [Improving sampling of binding free energy differences between covalently bound ligands in alternate binding pockets using MT-REXEE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06720)
*Anika Friedman,Michael Shirts*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents an enhanced sampling method using MT-REXEE to address free energy barriers in molecular systems. By modifying the swapping algorithm, they demonstrate improved sampling efficiency, leading to faster convergence in free energy estimates. The method is validated on a FabB-acyl chain system with multiple binding pockets, showing its promise for more complex systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge addressed is the difficulty in sampling complex molecular systems with high free energy barriers, particularly for flexible ligands. This is important because accurate free energy estimation is crucial for understanding binding interactions and drug design.

Method: The authors employ the MT-REXEE enhanced sampling approach and modify the conformational swapping algorithm to adaptively manage chain growth, allowing efficient sampling between different binding pockets. They validate the method on a previously studied system to compare performance with previous results.

Result: The modified algorithm significantly improves sampling efficiency, reducing computational time for free energy estimates. The method shows promise for systems beyond the studied case, such as those with multiple accessible binding sites or dynamic transitions.

Conclusion: This paper contributes an efficient enhanced sampling technique to molecular simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in managing complex binding scenarios with free energy barriers. The approach is particularly valuable for systems with multiple binding pockets and flexible ligands that require extensive simulation time to sample adequately.

Abstract: The primary limitation for the application of alchemical free energy methods
to a wider variety of complex molecular systems in achieving reasonable
sampling. Flexible binding complexes often have high free energy barriers,
which require prohibitively long simulations to sample sufficiently to obtain
reliable free energy estimates. An example of such a system is the FabB--acyl
chain complex, which features acyl chain substrates from 4 to 16 carbons in
length. Previous experimental evidence supports that there are also at least
two accessible binding pockets for the acyl chain bound to FabB. Sampling of
both pockets would require prohibitively long MD simulations or the creation of
complicated and nonobvious collective variables. With the multiple topology
replica exchange of expanded ensemble (MT-REXEE) enhanced sampling approach, we
can obtain highly efficient sampling between both pockets by adaptively growing
and shrinking the chains in the simulation ensemble, allowing each simulation
to visit chain lengths where transitions between the pockets do occur.
  To enable this enhanced sampling for the chain growth problem, we demonstrate
a new and improved conformational swapping selection algorithm for MT-REXEE,
and validate this algorithm on a previously studied simultaneous calculation of
multiple relative binding free energies. Using the new swapping approach gives
significantly enhanced sampling even for this simpler problem, as demonstrated
by faster convergence of free energy estimates.
  This case study demonstrates the utility of MT-REXEE and its open-source
implementation for systems that feature high free energy barriers for a subset
of ligands of interest, demonstrating a valuable addition to the existing
stable of enhanced sampling methods.

Abstract: Characterizing the morpho-mechanical properties of red blood cells (RBCs) is
crucial for understanding microvascular transport mechanisms and cellular
pathophysiological processes, yet current computational models are constrained
by multi-source uncertainties including cross-platform experimental
discrepancies and parameter identification stochasticity. We present RBC-MsUQ,
a novel multi-stage uncertainty quantification framework tailored for RBCs. It
integrates hierarchical Bayesian inference with diverse experimental datasets,
establishing prior distributions for RBC parameters via microscopic simulations
and literature-derived data. A dynamic annealing technique defines stress-free
baselines, while deep neural network surrogates, optimized through sensitivity
analysis, achieve sub-10$^{-2}$ prediction errors for efficient simulation
approximation. Its two-stage hierarchical inference architecture constrains
geometric and shear modulus parameters using stress-free state and stretching
data in Stage I and enables full-parameter identification via membrane
fluctuation and relaxation tests in Stage II. Applied to healthy and
malaria-infected RBCs, the RBC-MsUQ framework produces statistically robust
posterior distributions, revealing increased stiffness and viscosity in
pathological cells. Quantitative model-experiment validation demonstrates that
RBC-MsUQ effectively mitigates uncertainties through cross-platform data
fusion, overcoming the critical limitations of existing computational
approaches. The RBC-MsUQ framework thus provides a systematic paradigm for
studying RBC properties and advancing cellular mechanics and biomedical
engineering.

Abstract: Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly
outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains
commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of
devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs)
offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared
to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic
field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability
compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and
multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density
graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS
biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale
with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip
layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene
transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success
of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be
monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We
expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing
technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS
systems.

### [170] [Multiscale Microscopy via Automation: Dual Magnification ESEM Imaging by Frame Alternation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06523)
*Maurits Vuijk,Johannes Zeininger,Luis Sandoval,Günther Rupprechter,Beatriz Roldan Cuenya,Karsten Reuter,Thomas Lunkenbein,Christoph Scheurer*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper presents an automation interface for ESEM to collect multiple data sets simultaneously while minimizing human supervision, allowing dual imaging for cross-scale correlations in catalytic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are addressing the limitation of traditional ESEM methods which require constant acquisition parameters, leading to frequent human interaction and mono-frequency data collection. They aim to enhance flexibility and data throughput using automation.

Method: They designed an automiation interface for ESEM to interlace data collection, using oscillatory modes of a catalytic system as a test case. The interface allows changing acquisition parameters after each frame, achieving dual magnification imaging. They captured low and high magnification views to study mesoscopic and microscopic surface dynamics, respectively.

Result: The method enables dual magnification dual imaging, revealing cross-scale correlations such as phase changes in catalytic systems. This approach provides more comprehensive data sets, improving the understanding of complex catalytic processes.

Conclusion: The developed automation interface for ESEM significantly reduces human supervision, increases data collection efficiency, and allows for dual imaging to study multi-scale phenomena in catalyst systems, offering new insights into catalytic mechanisms.

Abstract: In Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) experiments, the
acquisition parameters are generally kept constant throughout the collection of
a data set. This limits data collection to one data set at a time, and frequent
human interaction is required to maintain the image quality. Here, we use a
custom-designed automation interface to minimize such supervision and allow for
the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. The oscillatory
modes of an example catalytic system (hydrogen oxidation over Co foil) were
employed as a tunable spatiotemporal test case. Using our automation interface,
we can implement more advanced acquisition programs into the microscope that
allow dual imaging - effectively bridging reaction monitoring between different
length scales. By using automation to change the settings of the acquisition
after each frame, we are able to capture alternating magnifications of the same
process and sample location. Both a low magnification overview of the
mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high magnification field of view of the
ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif were acquired. Using
such truly correlative data captured with the dual magnification method,
cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems including phase information
can be established.

*Scott Moroch,Carolyn Chun,Doug VanDerwerken,Ariana Shearin,Brian Beaudoin,Klaus Blaum,Timothy Koeth*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The paper describes a precise method for measuring the half-life of highly charged ions using non-destructive techniques in a Penning ion trap, achieving high detection efficiency and statistical accuracy with a realistic number of decays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Highly charged radioisotopes like ⁷Be³⁺ are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and solar neutrinos. Their half-lives affect our knowledge of nuclear processes in these environments, but existing methods are insufficient. The paper aims to address this gap by developing a new measurement technique.

Method: The paper proposes using Penning ion traps to detect non-destructive nuclear recoil. It simulates the sympathetic cooling of the trapped ⁷Be³⁺ ions, leading to their decay into ⁷Li³⁺. By detecting these decays, they measure the half-life. Coherent control over hyperfine states enhances the technique's fidelity.

Result: Simulation results show a 99.5% detection efficiency. Statistical analysis from ensembles of hundreds of ions reveals a 5% uncertainty achievable with 500 decays. This method allows direct measurement of state-dependent decay ratios for the first time.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves the accuracy and feasibility of measuring half-lives for highly charged radioisotopes, offering a valuable tool for astrophysical studies and neutrino physics.

Abstract: We present a novel method for measuring the half-life of highly charged
radioisotopes by non-destructive nuclear recoil detection in a Penning ion
trap. A specific emphasis is placed on $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$, which plays a crucial
role in stellar evolution and the production of solar neutrinos. The
determination of the half-life is necessary to constrain the free electron
capture rate in the solar environment, but is difficult to measure by existing
techniques. Simulations of the sympathetic cooling of the recoiled daughter
nuclei ($\rm ^7Li^{3+}$) with the trapped cloud of $\rm ^7Be^{3+}$ demonstrate
a decay detection efficiency of $99.5\%$. A statistical analysis of half-life
measurements on ensembles containing hundreds of ions shows that a final
statistical uncertainty of less than $5\%$ is achieved with only 500 measured
decays. By coherent control of hyperfine populations in trapped ions, the
fidelity of the technique we describe enables the direct measurement and
manipulation of state-dependent decay branching ratios for the first time.

TL;DR: sPHENIX's INTT tracker is designed for heavy-ion collisions, using 2023 Au+Au data and 2024 proton collisions for commissioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding particle tracking in high-energy collisions for better physics analysis. The tracking system's performance is crucial for identifying particles like heavy flavors and upsilon states, so analyzing INTT helps improve research accuracy.

Method: The project analyzes data from 2023 Au+Au collisions and 2024 pp proton collisions to gain insights into INTT's performance.

Result: The study shows promising tracking accuracy, especially in avoiding pile-up errors, aiding physics interpretation.

Conclusion: sPHENIX's INTT system effectively handles heavy-ion data, using proton data for ongoing tests, indicating reliable tracking performance.

Abstract: The sPHENIX collaboration has been taking data since 2023 at the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider in BNL to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma and cold Quantum
Chromodynamics (QCD). The tracking system of sPHENIX consists of a time
projection chamber, a MAPS-based vertex detector, and an intermediate silicon
tracker (INTT). Together with the sPHENIX full barrel calorimeter system, the
measurement of the heavy-flavor jets and the upsilon-state identification are
enabled. INTT, surrounding the collision point azimuthally at approximately 10
cm away with two layers of silicon strip sensors, detects hit points in the
intermediate area of the tracking system to enhance tracking precision. Thanks
to the good timing resolution of INTT, it also provides timing information to
corresponding hits of other tracking detectors. This capability eliminates
pile-up events due to misidentifying bunch crossings. This proceeding discusses
the achievements of INTT using Au+Au collision data taken in 2023, and the
status of INTT commissioning with proton+proton collisions in 2024.

Conclusion: This integrated approach enables observing 3D deformable fractures, aiding in predicting and understanding geophysical phenomena. It's a significant advancement in experimental techniques for fracture network analysis.

Abstract: We present a novel experimental approach based on 3D printing and X-ray
computed tomography to characterize fracture aperture distribution and
evolution in 3D fracture networks under varying stress loading conditions. We
validate our methodology by comparing experimentally measured stress-dependent
fracture apertures with both analytical solutions and numerical simulations,
for both single fracture and fracture network scenarios. We show that, for
fracture deformation under linear elastic regime, our experimental results
agree with numerical simulation. Furthermore, by combining our new experimental
methodology with advanced numerical simulations, we illuminate the complex
interplay of stress and topology in fracture network deformation. Our approach
opens the door for experimentally observing deformable fracture networks under
stress in 3D space, which has significant implications for understanding and
predicting many geophysical problems involving fractured geological media.

Abstract: Precise localization of gamma-ray interactions is crucial for the performance
of AGATA. The Pulse Shape Analysis (PSA) method used for the position
estimation relies on simulated signals database. The Pulse Shape Comparison
Scanning (PSCS) method was used to scan AGATA crystals in order to produce an

constructing experimental database. A custom masked loss function is introduced
to enable training with incomplete position information. The database generated
by this new method outperforms the simulated database used so far, and the
experimental database obtained from the conventional PSCS algorithm. Crucially,
the neural network approach effectively generalizes even when trained with only
one known coordinate per interaction, paving the way for simplified 1D scanning
procedures.

Method: 使用动态核 polarization（Triplet-DNP）方法，利用激发态三倍电子进行质子极化实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，在高辐射下，质子极化率保持在3%左右，但靶体因黄化出现不可逆的损伤。

Abstract: Polarized targets evolved into indispensable tools in particle and nuclear
physics. However, the polarized solid target is degraded by high-intense beam
irradiation, known as radiation damage due to target heating and radical
generation. We demonstrated a radiation-tolerant polarized solid target
operating at room temperature. An annealing allows the spontaneous repair of
the damage by reducing unwanted radicals. Using a single crystal of $\it
p$-terphenyl doped with 0.01 mol\% pentacene-$\it d$$_{14}$, Dynamic Nuclear
Polarization using photoexcited triplet electrons (Triplet-DNP) was applied to
proton spins at room temperature and in 0.39 T. For the proof of concept, a
deuteron beam with an energy of 135 MeV/u and the intensities of 10$^7$-10$^9$
counts per second (cps) was irradiated. The proton polarization was determined
to be 3.0\% $\pm$0.2\%$\rm{{(stat.)}}$ $\pm$0.1\%$\rm {{(sys.)}}$ from a
scattering asymmetry. The polarization was almost not attenuated up to 10$^9$
cps, but the target crystal was yellowed. The visible-light absorption
spectroscopy suggested irreversible radiation damage due to missing protons by
the knock-out reaction. The room-temperature polarized solid target allows
impractical experiments with the conventional target system, leading to a
next-generation spin-dependent accelerator science.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to study exotic gluons in boron-10 nuclei using the EIC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quark and gluon structures in nuclei is crucial for advancing nuclear physics. The EIC aims to observe gluonic states, and this paper presents a new approach using boron-10.

Method: The method involves polarizing boron atoms and using an EIC to observe the resulting gluon structure.

Result: The approach could directly observe exotic gluons enhancing fusion cross-sections.

Conclusion: This study opens new avenues for exploring internal particle dynamics of heavy nuclei.

Abstract: Unravelling the internal structure of hadrons and nuclei in terms of the
quarks and gluons of Quantum Chromodynamics is a central focus of current
nuclear physics research. Directly observing gluonic states in the nucleus
would be groundbreaking and is an objective of the future Electron-Ion Collider
(EIC). Over thirty years ago, Jaffe and Manohar identified a new
double-helicity flip structure function, directly sensitive to exotic gluons.
They pointed out that this could be measured in inclusive high-energy electron
scattering from a transversely polarized nuclear target with spin $I \ge 1$.
Here, we identify the spin-3 nucleus boron-10 as a particularly interesting
system to search for exotic gluons. Leveraging technical advances in atomic
physics over the past decade, we outline an experimental scheme to directly
optically pump a beam of stable boron atoms to polarize the nuclear spin.
Technical challenges to realize a spin-polarized beam of boron-10 in the EIC
are discussed. The proposed scheme will also polarize the $^{11}$B nucleus,
which could significantly enhance the pB fusion cross section.

Motivation: Automated analysis of particle size distributions in microgravity experiments to study their dynamics and behavior.

Method: Preprocessing steps followed by morphological granulometry to extract size information and assess dynamics.

Result: The method was successfully applied to two experiments, demonstrating effective size analysis and dynamics assessment.

Conclusion: This approach provides a quantitative basis for evaluating microgravity particle experiments through granulometric analysis.

Abstract: The aim of our work is to analyze size distributions of particles and their
agglomerates in imagery from astrophysical microgravity experiments. The data
acquired in these experiments are given by sequences consisting of several
hundred images. It is desirable to establish an automated routine that helps to
assess size distributions of important image structures and their dynamics in a
statistical way.
  The main technique we adopt to this end is the morphological granulometry.
After preprocessing steps that facilitate granulometric analysis, we show how
to extract useful information on size of particle agglomerates as well as
underlying dynamics. At hand of the discussion of two different microgravity
key experiments we demonstrate that the granulometric analysis enables to
assess important experimental aspects. We conjecture that our developments are
a useful basis for the quantitative assessment of microgravity particle

Motivation: The Einstein Telescope's focus on lower-frequency gravitational waves presents a challenge with magnetic noise, necessitating effective mitigation strategies like ferromagnetic shielding.

Method: The study evaluates ferromagnetic shielding's effectiveness and limitations by analyzing noise reduction and its practical implementation in the telescope's design.

Result: The implementation shows varied effectiveness, with significant noise reduction in some areas but limitations in others due to material constraints and design factors.

Conclusion: While ferromagnetic shielding is promising, further research and material advancements are needed for consistent noise reduction across all operational frequencies.

Abstract: The Einstein Telescope is the next-generation gravitational wave
interferometer which, compared to current detectors, will enable the
observation of gravitational signals at lower frequencies with a sensitivity
improved by approximately two orders of magnitude. Achieving such exceptional
sensitivity requires minimizing all sources of noise. In the low-frequency

Abstract: Inter-channel mis-synchronisation can be a limiting factor to the time
resolution of high performance timing detectors with multiple readout channels
and independent electronics units. In these systems, time calibration methods
employed must be able to efficiently correct for minimal mis-synchronisation
between channels and achieve the best detector performance. We present an
iterative time calibration method based on Markov Chains, suitable for detector
systems with multiple readout channels. Starting from correlated hit pairs
alone, and without requiring an external reference time measurement, the method
solves for fixed per-channel offsets, with precision limited only by the
intrinsic single-channel resolution. A mathematical proof that the method is
able to find the correct time offsets to be assigned to each detector channel
in order to achieve inter-channel synchronisation is given, and it is shown
that the number of iterations to reach convergence within the desired precision
is controllable with a single parameter. Numerical studies are used to confirm
unbiased recovery of true offsets. Finally, the application of the calibration
method to the Super Fine-Grained Detector (SuperFGD) and the Time of Flight
(TOF) detector at the upgraded T2K near detector (ND280) shows good improvement
in overall timing resolution, demonstrating the effectiveness in a real-world
scenario and scalability.

*Pradosh Pritam Dash,Costas D. Arvanitis*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: Acoustic holography in MHz can be used in manufacturing, NDT, and transcranial ultrasound, but designing lens topologies is challenging due to wave propagation effects. A heterogeneous angular spectrum approach is used to model varying sound speeds, enabling optimized lens designs. This allows for wavefront aberration correction and reconfigurable acoustic systems, including ones for neuro-interventions and monitoring CSF build-up. The approach simplifies design, is economical, and high-performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of designing efficient acoustic holography systems in high frequency ranges, which is useful for various applications, including medical ones. The proposed method using the heterogeneous angular spectrum approach seems innovative for optimizing lens design and improving accuracy in complex environments.

Method: The method involves using a heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to model and optimize lens thickness profiles by incorporating varying sound speeds and wavefront aberrations, enabling the design of reconfigurable acoustic systems.

Result: The application of the method leads to improved acoustic holography systems, particularly in medical applications such as neuro-interventions and CSF monitoring, due to accurate wave manipulation and efficient design.

Conclusion: The proposed framework can effectively design and reconfigure acoustic systems for high-precision medical applications, offering a significant advancement in the field of acoustic holography and its practical implementations.

Abstract: Acoustic holography in the megahertz frequency range can impact numerous
applications, including manufacturing, non-destructive testing, and
transcranial ultrasound. However, designing lens topologies for complex
acoustic holograms in the megahertz range poses a significant challenge, as
weave propagation effects through the lens cannot be ignored. Here, we show
that the inherent ability of heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to
incorporate in plane varying speed-of-sound maps and support rapid
differentiable optimization of lens thickness profiles can generate lens
topologies for high fidelity acoustic holography. Crucially, we show that this
framework can also account for wavefront aberrations in the propagation media,
providing the opportunity to reconfigure this disruptive technology for high
precision neuro-interventions. Our investigations also revealed that low
frequency acoustic feedback generated by nonlinear mixing of high frequency
waves allows attaining accurate skull-compensating lens alignment and creates
the possibility to monitor CSF fluid build-up and removal in hydrocephalus.
Together, our findings support the design of simple, economical, and
high-performance ultrasound systems.

*Yang Wan,Benjamin E. Grossman-Ponemona,Haneesh Kesari*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The study presents a novel algorithm to reconstruct the full acceleration field of a rigid body, addressing key limitations of existing methods with an efficient solution based on linear equations derived from rigid body kinematics, validated through controlled experiments with soccer headings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate, motion-based injury criteria to prevent mild traumatic brain injury through effective sensor placement strategies.

Method: Proposed an algorithm using linear equations from rigid body kinematics to reconstruct acceleration fields without requiring sensor positioning constraints beyond non-collinear accelerometers.

Result: Algorithm showed accurate acceleration prediction at unsensed locations across multiple trials in a controlled experiment.

Conclusion: Ideal for applications in contact sports, robotics, and biomechanical injury prediction with potential to optimize sensor placement strategies.

Abstract: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often results from violent head motion or
impact. Most prevention strategies explicitly or implicitly rely on motion- or
deformation-based injury criteria, both of which require accurate measurements
of head motion. We present an algorithm for reconstructing the full
acceleration field of a rigid body from measurements obtained by three
tri-axial accelerometers and one tri-axial gyroscope. Unlike traditional
gyroscope-based methods, which require numerically differentiating noisy
angular velocity data, or gyroscope-free methods, which may impose restrictive
sensor placement or involve nonlinear optimization, the proposed algorithm
recovers angular acceleration and translational acceleration by solving a set
of linear equations derived from rigid body kinematics. In the proposed method,
the only constraint on sensor placement is that the accelerometers must be
non-collinear. We validated the algorithm in controlled soccer heading
experiments, demonstrating accurate prediction of accelerations at unsensed
locations across trials. The proposed algorithm provides a robust, flexible,
and efficient tool for reconstructing rigid body motion, with direct
applications in contact sports, robotics, and biomechanical injury prediction.

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Quasinormal Modal Expansion Method to analyze topologically non-trivial states in finite systems, highlighting protection mechanisms and applications for finite-topology devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of topological waveguides in finite systems is crucial for practical applications of topological insulators.

Method: Quasinormal Modal Expansion Method (QMEM) for analyzing open, finite systems.

Result: The method reveals a connection between topological modes and leaky cavity modes, applicable for finite devices.

Conclusion: Finite topological devices can be effectively analyzed, offering insights into waveguiding protection and device design.

Abstract: Topological waveguides supporting quantum valley Hall interfacial states
confine waves to interfaces and, due to topological protection, are resistant
to backscattering even in the presence of defects. These topological insulators
are typically studied by means of an infinite spectral problem. However,
practical implementations are necessarily finite. In this work, we propose an
alternative framework for analysing topologically non-trivial states in open,
finite systems. Our approach is based on a Quasinormal Modal Expansion Method
(QMEM), which directly characterizes the existence and excitation of these
modes within the open system. The resulting spectrum is complex and discrete
and fully describes the topologically non-trivial states, revealing an analogy
of topological mode steering as a dispersive Fabry-P\'erot cavity, with a
dispersion relation closely related to that of the corresponding infinite
(Floquet-Bloch) ribbon problem. Our results illustrate how topologically
protected waveguiding can be understood in terms of leaky cavity modes and
offers a powerful framework for analysing finite topological devices.

Abstract: In this research, a reflection-based nanohole array sensor system is
presented for discriminating between migration-competent cancer cells that
maintain the integrity of the actin cortex and those cells lacking the actin

by studying the spectral features of the reflected light by live single cells.
We demonstrate that the presence of the actin cortex, needed for cell
migration, in different types of cancer cells significantly affect their
optical response, enabling high sensitivity and specificity in cell
classification. Our results pave the way for reflection-based plasmonic

Result: The study successfully calculates the ionization potential of thorium as 50868.735(54) cm⁻¹, a significant improvement over the current NIST value by two orders of magnitude. This precision gain is critical for accurate atomic modeling and related fields.

Conclusion: This research significantly advances the understanding of thorium's ionization potential by providing a highly precise measurement, crucial for applications in nuclear science, astrophysics, and beyond.

Abstract: High-lying Rydberg and autoionizing (AI) states of thorium (Th) have been
studied via resonance laser ionization spectroscopy at both TRIUMF Canada's
particle accelerator centre and Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). Multiple Rydberg
series converging to the ionization potential (IP) were observed via different
stepwise laser excitation schemes and were assigned to be the $6d^27s

determination of the IP to be 50868.735(54) cm$^{-1}$, which improved the
precision by two orders of magnitude over the current adopted NIST value of
50867(2) cm$^{-1}$. Additionally, four AI Rydberg series were identified and
assigned to $nf$ and $nd$ series converging to the $6d^27s$ $^4F_{5/2}$ and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy polar molecules are an important tool in precision physics experiments, particularly in searching for New Physics beyond the Standard Model. The challenge lies in their sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields, which can limit the accuracy of measurements. This paper presents a novel approach to mitigate such issues, making it highly relevant to the field.

Method: The researchers engineered clock transitions in YbOH molecules to create robust symmetry violations. They achieved significant suppression of electric and magnetic sensitivities using Ramsey measurements and identified quantum states suitable for measuring external electromagnetic fields.

Result: The experiments show at least a 700-fold suppression of electric sensitivity and 200-fold suppression of magnetic sensitivity. Robust spin coherence was observed, and quantum states were identified for effective field measurements.

Conclusion: This method enhances the precision of experiments searching for New Physics by reducing sensitivity to external fields while maintaining sensitivity to the electron electric dipole moment. It also broadens the applicability of molecular quantum science to various molecules and states.

Abstract: Heavy polar molecules are sensitive probes of physics Beyond the Standard
Model. However, uncontrolled external electromagnetic fields pose challenges to
achieving precise and accurate measurements. Minimizing susceptibility to these
fields is therefore critical and has played an important role in all precision
experiments of this type. Here we devise and demonstrate clock transitions
engineered to realize robust symmetry violation searches in the polyatomic
molecule YbOH. Sensitivities to external fields can be suppressed by
orders-of-magnitude while preserving high sensitivity to the electron electric
dipole moment (eEDM). We perform Ramsey measurements on these clock transitions
and observe suppression of electric and magnetic sensitivities by at least a
factor of 700 and 200, respectively, and demonstrate the robustness of their
spin coherence against large electromagnetic field fluctuations. We further
identify and employ selected quantum states to make sensitive measurements of
external magnetic and electric fields, another critical feature for highly
accurate measurements. This approach of molecular engineering is broadly
applicable to diverse molecular species and states, including those with
complex nuclei and those that are compatible with state-of-the-art cooling and
trapping techniques, thereby offering the potential to significantly improve
experimental sensitivity to a wide range of New Physics while expanding the

Conclusion:  ion Coulomb crystals are a promising platform for future exploration of new condensed matter phenomena, offering insights into quantum systems and technological advancements.

Abstract: Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional
condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several
micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline
structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external
confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can
be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence.
These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for
studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum
regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental
characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective.
We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and
three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their
out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for
exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well
as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances
in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.

Abstract: Control of the polarization of microwave fields is a key experimental
capability for a number of atomic physics platforms. However, producing
high-fidelity microwaves requires a well-controlled microwave environment,
where reflections that distort the polarization must be avoided or well
characterized, a constraint that often conflicts with other experimental design
considerations. Here we demonstrate a microwave control system capable of
producing high-fidelity microwave polarizations in a Rydberg-ensemble
experiment. We use three in-vacuum DC electrodes, repurposed as microwave
antennae, to produce imperfect and initially unknown polarizations. Each source
is driven with independent phase and amplitude control to generate the desired
microwave fields. We probe the fields produced at the position of the atoms
using Rydberg-EIT spectroscopy of the microwave-induced avoided crossings. We
produce $\sigma_-$, $\pi$, and $\sigma_+$ polarized microwaves with > 99 %
fidelity and generate their combinations. We extend our purification techniques
to frequencies away from Rydberg resonances by utilizing an auxiliary microwave
field, generating two-photon microwave resonances. The techniques developed
here will facilitate the engineering of dipolar interactions in atomic and
molecular physics experiments.

TL;DR: The study reports detailed vibrational spectroscopic analysis of the He2+ molecule, establishing its rovibrational structure and dissociation energy with high precision.

Motivation: The paper focuses on building a comprehensive understanding of the rovibrational structure of He₂⁺, detailing its energy levels, transitions, and dissociation characteristics, which are crucial for precision physics experiments involving photoelectron spectroscopy and for understanding the molecular structure and potential energy functions of helium diatomic molecules.

Method: The authors employed high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy to measure 17 vibrational levels of the He₂⁺ molecule, combined with quantum mechanical tunneling effects and fitting to empirical potential energy functions to derive a detailed rovibrational structure model.

Result: The study successfully models the rovibrational structure of He₂⁺ with an empirical effective potential, identifying 409 bound rovibrational levels and 74 shape resonances, and precisely determines the dissociation energy of He₂⁺ as 19,956.10 cm⁻¹.

Conclusion: This research advances precision physics by providing a detailed rovibrational model of He₂⁺, offering insights into vibrational energy levels and the molecule's dissociation potential, which are essential for future measurements and theoretical studies of diatomic molecules like He₂⁺.

Abstract: Excluding the very shallow potential minimum of the electronic ground state,
all bound electronic states of He$_2$ have Rydberg character. Their
potential-energy functions are similar to those of the He$_2^+$ states to which
the Rydberg series converge. Photoionization and electron-impact ionization of
the metastable $a~^3\Sigma_u^+$ state of He$_2$ are thus characterized by
diagonal Franck-Condon factors and only provide access to low vibrational
levels of the He$_2^+$ $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ electronic ground state. For this
reason, little experimental information is available on the excited vibrational
levels of He$_2^+$. We report a measurement, by high-resolution photoelectron
spectroscopy, of 17 vibrational levels of the $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ state of
$^4$He$_2^+$, with vibrational quantum number $v^+$ from 3 to 19 and covering
more than 95% of the potential well. To access these states, we exploit a hump
in the potential-energy function of the $c~^3\Sigma_g^+$ state, whose
vibrational wavefunctions extend to large internuclear distance by
quantum-mechanical tunneling through the potential barrier. Combining these
results with data on the lowest ($v^+=0-2$) and highest ($v^+=22, 23$)
vibrational levels of $^4$He$_2^+$, we derive a full map of the rovibrational
structure of He$_2^+$ and, in a least-squares fit, an empirical effective
potential-energy function that describes all experimental data within
uncertainties. This function yields the positions of the 409 bound
rovibrational levels and the positions and widths of the 74 shape resonances of
the $X^+$ $^2\Sigma_u^+$ state of $^4$He$_2^+$. The dissociation energy of
He$_2^+$ is $D{\rm e}=19,956.10(10)$ cm$^{-1}$ [$D_0(^4{\rm
He}_2^+)=19,101.29(10)$ cm$^{-1}$].

TL;DR: It’s all about accurately measuring atomic temperatures in optical lattice clocks, comparing two models, and finding discrepancies up to a factor of two with significant implications for precision metrology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atomic temperature measurements are critical for quantum sensing and precision metrology. The paper compares two models to measure temperatures in ytterbium optical lattice clocks, highlighting discrepancies that could affect clock accuracy.

Method: The researchers used sideband and Doppler spectroscopy in INRIM's ytterbium clock, employing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling. They compared a harmonic oscillator model with a Born-Oppenheimer-based model to assess temperature estimates and evaluated the impact on frequency shifts.

Result: The harmonic oscillator and Born-Oppenheimer models lead to discrepancies in temperature measurements, with up to 2x differences, affecting precision. Extended Sisyphus cooling reduces discrepancies but doesn't eliminate them, impacting the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.

Conclusion: Improved modeling is essential for accurate atomic temperature measurement in optical clocks to minimize systematic uncertainties and enhance overall precision.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is essential for a wide range of
applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice
clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize
systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate
atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock
developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across
a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated
Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at
shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature
estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using
a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate
description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions,
especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime.
Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed
depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling
differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations
up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these
inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may
still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.

nonadiabatic, relativistic and quantum-electrodynamics corrections are
possible. Precise spectroscopic measurements are needed as references to test
these calculations. We report here on a spectroscopic measurement of the $c$
$^3\Sigma_g^+\leftarrow a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+$ electronic transition of $^4$He$_2$
at a precision ($\Delta \nu/\nu$) of $2.5\times 10^{-10}$ and with full
resolution of the rotational, spin-spin and spin-rotational fine structures.
The investigation focuses on transitions to the rotational levels of the $c$
$^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ state, located energetically above the He$(1$ $^1S_0) +
$He$(2$ $^3S_1)$ dissociation limit and decaying by tunneling predissociation
through a barrier in the $c$ state. The new data include a full map of the
energy levels of the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states
with rotational quantum numbers $N$ up to 9 and 10, respectively, and full sets
of fine-structure intervals in these levels for comparison with
first-principles calculations from a parallel investigation [B. R\'acsai, P.
Jeszenszki, A. Marg\'ocsy and E. Maty\'us, arXiv:2506.23879v1 (2025)]. The new
data were combined with data from earlier measurements of the spectrum of the
$c-a$ band system of $^4$He$_2$ to derive full sets of molecular constants for
the $a$ $^3\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with much
improved precision over previous experimental results. A pronounced broadening
of the linewidths of the transitions to the $c$ $^3\Sigma_g^+(v=4,N=10)$
fine-structure levels is attributed to tunneling predissociation through a
barrier in the potential of the $c$ state and is quantitatively accounted for
by calculations of the predissociation widths.

### [195] [The two--component discrete KP hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07350)
*Wenqi Cao,Jipeng Cheng,Jinbiao Wang*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a two-component generalization of the discrete KP hierarchy, termed the 2dKP hierarchy, and explores its Lax formulation and reduction properties through difference operators and loop algebras, providing a detailed theoretical framework and connections to integrable systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to delve into the mathematical structure of integrable systems, specifically focusing on the KP hierarchy. It offers a two-component extension and discusses its Lax equation formulation, which is crucial for understanding the behavior and solutions of such systems. The study of Lax operators and reductions might provide tools for analyzing nonlinear partial difference equations and their applications in physics and mathematics.

Method: The authors start by deriving the 2dKP's Lax equation using the Shiota method, employing scalar Lax operators with two difference operators. They then move from the Lax equation to the bilinear equation, emphasizing the role of tau functions. The paper concludes with an exploration of the 2dKP hierarchy's reduction related to a specific loop algebra, which is typically used to generate solutions for integrable hierarchies.

Result: The paper successfully constructs a new two-component integrable system, the 2dKP hierarchy, by extending the discrete KP hierarchy. By utilizing difference operators and loop algebras, they derive a consistent Lax formulation and highlight the existence of a tau function, which is essential for the hierarchy's solutions. Additionally, the reduction to a particular loop algebra is thoroughly examined, showing potential applications in solving and understanding integrable systems.

Conclusion: The paper articulates a method for constructing integrable hierarchies with multiple components by starting from a bilinear equation and employing Lax formulations. It underscores the central role of tau functions and difference operators, while the reduction to a loop algebra demonstrates the hierarchy's versatility in integrable system theory. This work significantly contributes to the theoretical framework of discrete integrable systems, providing tools and insights for their further study and application.

Abstract: The discrete KP hierarchy is also known as the $(l-l')$--th modified KP
hierarchy. Here in this paper, we consider the corresponding two--component
generalization, called the two--component discrete KP (2dKP) hierarchy.
Firstly, starting from the bilinear equation of the 2dKP hierarchy, we derive
the corresponding Lax equation by the Shiota method, this is using scalar Lax
operators involving two difference operators $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$. Then
starting from the 2dKP Lax equation, we obtain the corresponding bilinear
equation, including the existence of the tau function. From above discussions,
we can determine which are essential in the 2dKP Lax formulation. Finally, we
discuss the reduction of the 2dKP hierarchy corresponding to the loop algebra
$\widehat{sl}_{M+N}=sl_{M+N}[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]\oplus\mathbb{C}c \
(M,N\geq1)$.

Abstract: A pulsed supersonic slit jet expansion of a dilute mixture of 1,1
difluoroethylene (DFE) in helium is probed using a tunable infrared source to
obtain spectra of (DFE)2, DFE-He, and DFE-He2. The DFE dimer is found to have a
slipped antiparallel structure with two-fold rotational symmetry and little or
no dipole moment (explaining why no pure rotational spectrum has been
observed). The separation of the monomer centers of mass is 3.44 {\AA}. The
spectra of DFE-He show line splittings due to tunneling of the He atom from one
side of the DFE plane to the other. Rotational analysis of the DFE-He tunneling
components in terms of a conventional asymmetric rotor yields small systematic
errors due to the presence of large amplitude motions. A relatively weak
spectrum is analyzed for one band of DFE-He2, whose structure places the two He
atoms in equivalent positions on each side of DFE, very close to the location
of He in DFE-He. Extensive spectra of DFE monomer were also obtained while
searching for the cluster bands. A total of 23 bands from 2210 to 3105 cm-1
were observed. These are the first such high resolution results in this region,
and they are of special interest because DFE has been a prototype for the study
of vibrational anharmonicity and resonances

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many
fundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven
solvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a
solvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in
classic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in
simulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded
point charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to
singular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a
realistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields
its embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However,
this core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent
density that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In
this work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed
test charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted
anywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite
energies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations
in the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is
linear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for
solvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian
charges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the
theories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian
test charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric
response in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically
predict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar
solutes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of angular momentum generation in chiral molecular systems under thermal gradients is important for advancing spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport models.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations were used to study angular momentum generation in driven chiral models.

Result: Significant vibrational angular momentum is induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, comparable in magnitude to optically driven systems. Symmetry breaking plays a key role in the generation of angular momentum in non-equilibrium internal atomic motion.

Conclusion: The research highlights the general phenomenon of angular momentum generation in driven chiral structures, pointing to symmetry-breaking mechanisms and potential applications in spintronics and energy transport.

Abstract: The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems
lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel
mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and
energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using
theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum
generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that
significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical
and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically
driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common
and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of
symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such
systems.

*Álvaro Diaz-Duque,Vasileios Balos,Alexander P. Fellows,Martin Wolf,Martin Thämer*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the anisotropic water structure near charged surfaces by developing a time-domain spectrometer. They observe how water molecules orient differently at various depths, influenced by interfacial electric fields. Their method combines phase-resolved sum- and difference-frequency spectroscopy to extract depth-dependent information, showing that local hydrogen bonds remain intact despite the strong electric fields. The findings are crucial for understanding microscale water structure in charged environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structure of water at interfaces is fundamental to many biomolecular and surfactant-related fields, but recent advancements in experimental techniques are needed to study the detailed depth-dependent anisotropy of molecular orientations.

Method: The researchers developed a time-domain spectrometer that combines phase-resolved vibrational sum- and difference-frequency spectroscopy to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces. This technique allows them to extract depth information on the nanometer scale and analyze resonant spectral line shapes to understand local hydrogen-bond structures and molecular orientation anisotropy.

Result: Through their method, the researchers demonstrated the ability to reconstruct the nonlinear vibrational responses as a function of depth, identifying two prominent regions with significant differences in molecular orientation. They also found that the natural hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains intact in the interfacial region, including near the surface charges.

Conclusion: The study significantly enhances our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at charged interfaces and validates the effectiveness of their depth-resolved spectroscopic technique, opening new possibilities for future research in fields such as biomolecular surfaces and charged surfactants. Selector for proper experimental design to study such microscale features.

Abstract: The molecular structure of water at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by
interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the
molecular orientations that extends over nanometer-scale distances. Despite
great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent
anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental
techniques. Here, we present a time-domain spectrometer specifically developed
to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces.
The approach is based on combining phase-resolved vibrational sum- and
difference-frequency spectra and enables the extraction of depth information on
the nanometer scale. The analysis of the acquired resonant spectral line shapes
meanwhile yields insight into local hydrogen-bond structures and anisotropic
molecular orientations across the interfacial region. In measurements with
insoluble charged surfactants, we demonstrate that the obtained data allows for
a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of
depth. The results show the presence of two pronounced regions within the
interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular
orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses
furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk
water remains intact throughout the interfacial region, including water in the
direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine
our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to
charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved
spectroscopic technique.

*Theo Juncker von Buchwald,Erik Rosendahl Kjellgren,Jacob Kongsted,Stephan P. A. Sauer,Sonia Coriani,Karl Michael Ziems*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses approximations for quantum linear response (qLR) methods, finding that certain approximations perform well in some cases but not in systems with strong correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the impact of different approximations on the quantum linear response method, which is important for NISQ quantum computers as they are prone to errors and limitations in scaling methods.

Method: The authors study four different active spaces and their respective systems, using approximations for 2-body, 3-body, and 4-body density matrices and cumulants. They evaluate the performance of these approximations through numerical tests.

Result: Approximations that avoid 3-body RDMs and RDCs perform better; however, their use is limited in systems with strong correlation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the approximations for qLR should focus on reducing the computational load without significantly affecting the method's accuracy, but their success is context-dependent based on the system's correlation strength.

Abstract: Linear response (LR) is an important tool in the computational chemist's
toolbox. It is therefore no surprise that the emergence of quantum computers
has led to a quantum version, quantum LR (qLR). However, the current quantum
era of near-term intermediary scale quantum (NISQ) computers is dominated by
noise, short decoherence times, and slow measurement speed. It is therefore of
interest to find approximations that greatly reduce the quantum workload while
only slightly impacting the quality of a method. In an effort to achieve this,
we approximate the naive qLR with singles and doubles (qLRSD) method by either
directly approximating the reduced density matrices (RDMs) or indirectly
through their respective reduced density cumulants (RDCs). We present an
analysis of the measurement costs behind qLR with RDMs, and report qLR results
for model Hydrogen ladder systems; for varying active space sizes of OCS,
SeH$_2$, and H$_2$S; and for symmetrically stretched H$_2$O and BeH$_2$.
  Discouragingly, while approximations to the 4-body RDMs and RDCs seem to
produce good results for systems at the equilibrium geometry and for some types
of core excitations, they both tend to fail when the system exhibits strong
correlation. All approximations to the 3-body RDMs and/or RDCs severely affect
the results and cannot be applied.

Abstract: The development of reliable luminescent nanothermometers for cryogenic
applications is essential for advancing quantum technologies, superconducting
systems, and other fields that require precise, high-spatial-resolution
temperature monitoring. Lanthanide-doped systems are vastly employed to this
purpose, and typically perform optimally at or above room temperature when
manifold-to-manifold transitions are used. In this work we exploit individual
Stark sublevels to demonstrate an optical thermometer based on
Er$^{3+}$/Yb$^{3+}$ codoped yttria (Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles that operates
effectively across the temperature range from 25 K to 175 K. This is achieved
due to the pronounced crystal field environment of the the Y$_2$O$_3$ host
matrix, leading to well-separated Stark lines in the luminescence spectrum of
the Er$^{3+}$ ions. By applying the Luminescence Intensity Ratio (LIR) method
to transitions originating from two Stark components of the $^4$S$_{3/2}$
manifold of the Er$^{3+}$ ions, we achieve thermal sensitivities up to 1.25 %
K$^{-1}$ at 100 K and temperature resolutions reaching 0.2 K. Our results
further experimentally confirm recently published theoretical predictions,
demonstrating that thermometric performance is not directly dependent on the
average (barycenter) difference of the involved electronic energy levels when
using individual Stark transitions to evaluate the LIR. The proposed procedure
gives an energy gap calibration that matches the one determined by sample
spectroscopy for non-overlapping lines in the luminescence spectrum. These
insights provide a robust foundation for the design of high-performance
cryogenic thermometers based on rare-earth-doped materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a tool for understanding and analyzing rare but critical events in complex systems like protein folding or climate change without the need for exhaustive configuration space sampling, which is often infeasible.

Method: The method involves a nonparametric optimization framework focusing on reaction coordinates using trajectory data, allowing robust analysis even with incomplete data.

Result: The framework is shown to accurately estimate committors and free energy profiles, with applications in diverse fields including protein dynamics, ocean circulation, and clinical datasets.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this framework offers a flexible, robust method for studying complex dynamical systems without requiring exhaustive data, demonstrating its effectiveness across various challenging real-world applications.

Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding,
chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate
phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics.
Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the
progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such
processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that
incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular
or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through
increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it
provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and
yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further
illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean
circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results
demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without
exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general,
flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and
longitudinal datasets.

*Bo Wang,Shaohang Luo,Zikuan Wang,Wenjian Liu*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents O1NumHess, an efficient algorithm for calculating molecular system Hessians using fewer gradients by exploiting their low-rank structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hessian matrix is crucial for many computational chemistry and physics calculations, but its computation is often computationally expensive, leading researchers to seek more efficient methods.

Method: O1NumHess uses finite differentiation of gradients from displaced geometries. It leverages the off-diagonal low-rank (ODLR) property of Hessians, significantly reducing the number of required gradients from O(N) to O(1).

Result: The method shows errors comparable to conventional Hessians but takes significantly less time, with results over 100 times faster for larger systems.

Conclusion: O1NumHess offers a computationally efficient alternative for calculating Hessians, particularly beneficial for large molecular systems. An open-source implementation is available for broader use.

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new algorithm, O1NumHess, to calculate the
Hessian of a molecular system by finite differentiation of gradients calculated
at displaced geometries. Different from the conventional seminumerical Hessian
algorithm, which requires gradients at $O(N_{\mathrm{atom}})$ displaced
geometries (where $N_{\mathrm{atom}}$ is the number of atoms), the present
approach only requires $O(1)$ gradients. Key to the reduction of the number of
gradients is the exploitation of the off-diagonal low-rank (ODLR) property of
Hessians, namely the blocks of the Hessian that correspond to two distant
groups of atoms have low rank. This property reduces the number of independent
entries of the Hessian from $O(N_{\mathrm{atom}}^2)$ to $O(N_{\mathrm{atom}})$,
such that $O(1)$ gradients already contain enough information to uniquely
determine the Hessian. Numerical results on model systems (long alkanes and
polyenes), transition metal reactions (WCCR10) and non-covalent complexes
(S30L-CI) using the BDF program show that O1NumHess gives frequency, zero-point
energy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy errors that are only about two times
those of conventional double-sided seminumerical Hessians. Moreover, O1NumHess
is always faster than the conventional numerical Hessian algorithm, frequently
even faster than the analytic Hessian, and requires only about 100 gradients
for sufficiently large systems. An open-source implementation of this method,
which can also be applied to problems irrelevant to computational chemistry, is
available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this study is to understand the role of OH in alkaline HER and how pH and NaOH concentration affect the reaction kinetics, aiming to develop a unified mechanism for electrolyte effects on HER.

Method: Systematic experiments involving varying pH and NaOH concentrations, both with and without fixed total Na concentration. Analysis included measurements of HER activity, Tafel slopes, and infrared spectroscopy to observe hydrogen-bond networks.

Result: Key findings include monotonic increase in HER activity with increasing OH concentration, decreased Tafel slopes indicating accelerated kinetics at higher pH and NaOH concentrations. Infrared data shows strengthened hydrogen bonding due to interfacial OH, supporting the role of hydrogen bonds in lowering activation energy for the rate-determining Volmer step.

Conclusion: This study reveals a unified mechanism where structure-making ions like OH enhance alkali HER kinetics by reinforcing the interfacial hydrogen bond network, offering insights into optimizing HER reactions in various applications like hydrogen fuel cells.

Abstract: The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media suffers from sluggish
kinetics but the origin of the pH-dependent activity remains debated. This
study investigates the role of hydroxide ions (OH) in enhancing the alkaline
HER at Au(111) by systematically varying the pH and the NaOH concentration both
with and without fixing the total Na concentration.Contrary to conventional
cation-centric models of alkaline HER, we demonstrate a notable anion effect by
showing that the HER activity increases monotonically with pH and OH
concentration, even at extremely high NaOH concentrations(up to 9 M).Tafel
slopes decrease from 181 mV/dec at pH=10 to 124 mV/dec at pH=13 and to 111
mV/dec for the case with 9 M NaOH, indicating accelerated kinetics.Infrared
spectroscopy reveals that interfacial OH strengthens the hydrogen-bond network,
which is expected to lower the activation energy for the Volmer step,the
rate-determining step of HER on Au(111). Hence,OH enhances alkaline HER
kinetics by strengthening the hydrogen bond network and its connectivity at the
electrochemical interface;this allows us to propose a unified mechanism for the
electrolyte effects on alkaline HER where structure-making ions (Li,K,and OH)
improve the reaction kinetics by optimizing the interfacial hydrogen bond
network.
