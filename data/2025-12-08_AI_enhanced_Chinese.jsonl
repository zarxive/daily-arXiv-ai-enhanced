These pulses find applications in photoemission spectroscopy in condensed matter physics, pump-probe spectroscopy for high-energy-density plasmas, and attosecond science. However, optical aberrations in the high-power laser systems required for HHG degrade beam quality and reduce efficiency. We present a machine learning approach to optimize aberration correction using a spatial light modulator.

The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling.

While standard formulas describe the interference of circular Gaussian beams, many real systems use beams with elliptical cross sections, where differing waists and radii of curvature can reduce fringe visibility. This paper derives an analytic expression for the maximum contrast achievable between two aligned elliptical Gaussian beams, written entirely in terms of their geometric and power parameters. We then test the formula using a free-space Michelson interferometer in which all beam parameters are independently measured through beam profiling and nonlinear fitting. In our experiment, the predicted maximum contrast was 0.968 while the experimentally optimized value was 0.950. The small discrepancy is consistent with expected imperfections such as beam rotation, mode mismatch, and non-Gaussian aberrations.

The model assimilates a short prefix of observed fields, conditions on a scalar source action and structure/material map, and generates closed-loop rollouts in the physical domain. Training in a symmetric-log domain ensures numerical stability. Evaluated on a reproducible FDTD benchmark (200 unique simulations, structure-wise split), FieldSeer I achieves higher suffix fidelity than GRU and deterministic baselines across three practical settings: (i) software-in-the-loop filtering (64x64, P=80->Q=80), (ii) offline single-file rollouts (80x140, P=240->Q=40), and (iii) offline multi-structure rollouts (80x140, P=180->Q=100).

Apparatuses designed for this type of experiment fall short of providing high-speed isolated collisions with a high probability of contact. In this article, we propose a novel apparatus that combines pneumatic conveying and acoustic levitation to provide an electrically and physically isolated, high impact speed collision between two sub-centimeter particles with a collision success rate of 93 %. We can control the pre-contact charge, material, and size of both particles, and the impact speed and angle. Test results show that charge transfer between two insulator particles is not solely driven by contact potential difference; it is a stochastic process that requires large datasets to resolve and understand.

Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4f4d\u77e2\u8026\u5408\u7684\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u8c03\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u65ad\u5f00\u68af\u5ea6\u540e\uff0c\u6da1\u65cb\u5448\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u7ef4\u6301\u957f\u8fbe1000\u6beb\u79d2\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u78c1\u573a\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6fc0\u53d8\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u51fa\u73b0\u65b0\u6da1\u65cb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u78c1\u6027\u573a\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u5229\u7528BEC\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u4eea\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u5300\u5f3a\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u78c1\u6027\u573a\u7684\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\uff08BEC\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u77e2\u8026\u5408\u7684BEC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8c03\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6da1\u65cb\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u6210\u78c1\u573a\u4eea\u5668\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8026\u5408Gross-Pitaevskii\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f4d\u77e2\u8c03\u5e45\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6da1\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6da1\u65cb\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u59821\u52306\u4e2a\u6da1\u65cb\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u65ad\u5f00\u68af\u5ea6\u540e\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u8c03\u5236\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u5de5\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u573a\u5f3a\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u78c1\u573a\u3002\u6da1\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5982\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5468\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6da1\u65cb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u65bd\u52a0\u4e0d\u540c\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5747\u5300\u6216\u68af\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u4e2dBEC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4d\u77e2\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6da1\u65cb\u5de5\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This approach achieves a field sensitivity within 13% of the standard quantum limit, a response time that exceeds the Chu limit by more than 11 orders of magnitude, and in-situ near-field mapping with \u03bb/3000 spatial resolution.

Under this limit, the field equations yield the constraint $F(Q,T)H(t)=C$, implying that the function $F=f_Q$ becomes purely dependent on the nonmetricity scalar $Q$, and the background evolution mimics that of the standard $\u039b$CDM model. We derive the resulting functional forms of $f(Q)$, obtain the corresponding effective cosmological constant, and analyze the physical nature of this reduction. To test the model against observations, we constrain the parameters $H_0$, $\u03a9_m$, and $S_8$ using cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon+ SN Ia datasets. A comparative analysis is performed using both the conventional Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and a machine-learning based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emulator. We find that the ANN approach yields tighter posterior constraints while significantly reducing computational time. The model successfully reproduces the observational trends of each dataset and offers insights into the persistent $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions.

While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver.

Along with the tunability of the magnon-photon coupling strength, fast information transfer and conversion speed are desired in hybrid devices. This can be achieved utilizing the propagating nature of spin waves with non-zero momentum for their ultra-fast time dynamics and reduced ohmic dissipation. Antiferromagnets are particularly interesting as hosts for magnons since stray-field interactions are minimized, and they support multiple modes with distinctive magnetic-field behavior across the phase diagram. CrCl3 is a van der Waals antiferromagnet having a strong easy-plane anisotropy and a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. Despite some magnetic resonance studies, the impact of magnetic reorientation of spins in CrCl3 on cavity-magnon-polariton interaction strength as a function of magnetic field remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the coupling between magnons in CrCl3 and photons in a coplanar waveguide resonator as a function of magnetic field. In particular, we find that the magnon-photon coupling strength varies nonmonotonically and distinctly with the magnetic field for both acoustic and optical magnons, enabling tuning of the coupling strength with an external magnetic field as a knob. We find the signature of spin-flop transition in two harmonics of the cavity due to a stronger dispersive coupling between optical magnons and cavity photons at lower fields. Additionally, we find standing modes formed by spin waves with nonzero momentum associated with the two hybrid magnons when the external field is applied at an angle with the crystal plane. These modes do not undergo substantial coupling with the cavity mode unlike the antiferromagnetic modes and can be used as low-loss propagation channels in hybrid devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4ecb\u4e8e\u4ecb-document>, this paper introduces cavity-magnon-polaritons, their properties, and their potential application in hybrid devices.

The configuration is analyzed using the separation of variables method and Mathieu functions. In this approach, the structural geometry is illuminated by an electromagnetic field. Radial and angular Mathieu functions have been used in the formulation. Notably, the maxima of the scattered elliptic transfer electric mode ($\u03b8= 180^{\\circ}$) are much higher than those of the scattered transfer magnetic mode, comparable to terms $\u03b8= 120^{\\circ}$ and $\u03b8= 240^{\\circ}$, respectively. It can be observed that an increase in the in-plane radial component leads to the linearity principle for the transfer electric mode, while non-linear behavior is investigated for the elliptic transfer magnetic mode. Therefore, the unidirectional bistatic echo width is subject to non-directional behavior. These analogous results may have applications in the fields of optics, meteorology, acoustics, radio astronomy, collision physics, and other disciplines where wave scattering phenomena play a crucial role.

For the inertia ratio I = (2,2,1) and r = (0,0,1), the curvature balance reveals a distinguished pure-precession regime: a nontrivial family of motions in which the tilt angle gamma_3 remains constant and the dynamics reduce to uniform precession with explicit trigonometric solutions. The family is characterized and derived explicitly, and a Lax representation is obtained. This regime illustrates how geometric lifting and curvature balance can isolate simplified dynamical structures even inside non-integrable systems. In addition, we briefly discuss the role of a numerical symmetry detection procedure based on curvature forcing, which guided the identification of the (2,2,1) parameters as geometrically distinguished.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Dynamic radiative thermal emitters that can switch between passive cooling and heating modes offer a promising solution, but most existing devices exhibit broadband optical responses, resulting in unwanted parasitic heat exchange and limited performance. Here, we introduce an elegant strategy that uses a dielectric cap to transform broadband metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials into spectrally selective dynamic emitters. This design creates a highly tunable Fabry-Perot cavity, enabling a tailored thermal emission spectrum by engineering the reflected-wave phase profile. Our Fresnel-formalism-based phasor diagram analysis reveals two key routes for realizing high spectral selectivity: a high-index dielectric cap and a low-loss metallic MIT state, which are further validated by Bayesian optimization. Following this principle, we demonstrated a wide-angle spectrally-selective thermoregulator operating in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 um), where the thermal emittance can be electrically tuned from about 0.2 to 0.9 through reversible copper electrodeposition on a germanium cavity. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to multispectral electrochromic windows, enabling switching between solar heating and spectrally-selective radiative cooling. Our work establishes a versatile and generalizable paradigm for spectral engineering of dynamic thermal emitters, opening opportunities in energy-efficient buildings, wearable thermal comfort, spacecraft thermoregulation, and multispectral camouflage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5149\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91d1\u5c5e-\u4ecb\u7535\u4f53\u8fc7\u6e21\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u70ed\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7f\u900f-\u7ed5\u5c04\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u5927\u9891\u7387_gap\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u5408\u5728\u5927\u6c14\u900f\u660e\u7a97\u53e3\uff088-13 \u03bcm\uff09\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u53ef\u9006\u7535\u81f4\u51b7\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u4fdd\u8282\u80fd\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u4eba\u4f53\u8212\u9002\u548c\u592a\u7a7a thermoregulation \u5f00\u62d3\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4f53\u6e29\u8c03\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\u8bbe\u5907\u5b58\u5728 many issues\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5149\u8c31\u4e0dselective\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u70ed\u91cf\u6d41\u5931\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a dielectric cap \u6765\u5c06 broadband \u94dc-\u4ecb\u7535\u4f53\u8fc7\u6e21\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u6cd5\u62c9\u7b2c-\u4f69\u5c14\u6258 cavity\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u5b9a\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u53d1\u5c04\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7a7f\u900f-\u7ed5\u5c04\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d39 exchange\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 Bayesian \u4f18\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728 germanium \u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u9540 copper \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7535\u81f4\u51b7\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bbd\u89d2\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u5927\u6c14\u900f\u660e\u7a97\u53e3\uff088-13 \u03bcm\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 germanium \u80cc\u9762\u7535\u9540 copper\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u7ea6 0.2 \u5230 0.9 \u7684\u70ed\u53d1\u5c04\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u8c31\u7cfb\u7535\u8272\u53d8\u6362\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7535\u81f4\u51b7\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5149\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u70ed\u4ea4\u6362\u5668\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u4eba\u4f53\u8212\u9002\u3001\u592a\u7a7a thermoregulation \u548c\u591a\u8c31\u7cfb camouflage \u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This research highlights the crucial role of the interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (DSOC). Employing a Fermi-Hubbard model alongside the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we examine the combined effects of RSOC and DSOC on these exotic superfluid phases, taking into account attractive fermionic interactions. Our principal finding reveals that while RSOC primarily stabilizes conventional zero-momentum pairing, DSOC performs a distinct and crucial role in selectively stabilizing the intraband FFLO phase. This stabilization is achieved by enhancing spin polarization within a single helicity band and suppressing interband coherence, thereby facilitating the formation of finite-momentum FFLO pairs within the same band and resulting in the emergence of a topologically nontrivial superfluid. This targeted control of intraband FFLO pairing paves the way for new strategies in the manipulation of superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled systems and offers essential insights for experimental realizations in ultracold atomic gases, with implications for topological quantum computing and Majorana fermions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4Fermi\u6c14\u4f53\u5728\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684FFLO\u8d85\u6d41\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u8ff0RSOC\u4e0eDSOC\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u8d85\u6d41\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8d85\u6d41\u6001\u5bf9\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u53ca\u5947\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8d39\u7c73 Hubbard\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "RSOC\u4e3b\u8981\u7a33\u5b9a\u54ea\u79cd\u8d85\u6d41\u6001\uff1fDSOC\u5bf9\u600e\u6837\u7684FFLO\u72b6\u6001\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff1f", "conclusion": "RSOC\u548cDSOC\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f62\u6210\u54ea\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u8d85\u6d41\u6001\uff1f"}}

In particular, we illustrate the basic energetic and symmetry requirements for chirality induced spin selectivity where the chirality emerges from the electronic degrees of freedom following excitation with circularly polarized light. We study this effect in a simple model of a metalloporphyrin complex with an axial acceptor ligand using quantum mechanical rate theories and numerical simulations. We find that the spin polarization emerges due to the selective excitation of a ring current within the porphryin, breaking the degeneracy of the two degenerate spin states. The resultant spin polarization increases with the spin orbit coupling between the metal in the porphyrin and the axial ligand, and is transient, with a lifetime dependent on the rate of dephasing from the Jahn-Teller distortion mode. This proposed effect should be observable in spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5706\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u91d1\u5c5e\u5bf9\u82ef\u73af\u5728\u73af\u7535\u6d41\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7834\u8f74\u6027\u5bf9\u82ef\u73af\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u914d\u4f4d\u4f53\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u82ef\u73af\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668 respond to chiral excitation\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u662f\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u901f\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7531\u73af\u7535\u6d41\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u4e8e\u91d1\u5c5e-\u914d\u4f4d\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u53e0\u80fd\u5347\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316 lifetime\u53d7Jahn-Teller\u632f\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u901f\u7387\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5bf9\u82ef\u73af\u4f5c\u4e3a\u78c1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u54cd\u5e94 chiral excitation\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u671b\u5728\u73af\u81ea\u65cb\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u4e2d\u88ab\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u3002"}}

We also show that the result holds when using a more general Lennard-Jones potential to describe the interaction between the ion and its collision partner.

First, we find that as the dark matter parameter $\\left|\u03b1\\right|$ increases, the fundamental characteristic quantities of the black hole, the event horizon $r_h$, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ all increase, while the peak of the effective potential $V_{\\text{eff}}$ decreases and shifts toward the direction of increasing $r$. In contrast, the magnetic charge parameter $g$ suppresses $r_h$, $r_{ph}$, and $b_{ph}$, while increases the peak of $V_{\\text{eff}}$ and shifts it toward the direction of decreasing $r$. This indicates a competing effect between the dark matter parameter $\\left|\u03b1\\right|$ and the magnetic charge parameter $g$ on the fundamental properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we use the EHT observational data to constrain the dark matter parameters $\u03b1$ and find that the constraint range given by the supermassive black hole SgrA* is stricter than that of the black hole M87*. Finally, the black hole images are studied based on different accretion models, and it is found that both dark matter parameters $\u03b1$ and accretion models significantly influence the black hole images. For larger dark matter parameters $\\left|\u03b1\\right|$, the inner shadow or central faint illuminating region of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by PFDM is larger but the bright ring of the image is fainter. This provides a potential method for us to distinguish between classical Bardeen black holes and Bardeen black holes surrounded by PFDM.

Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8861\u91cf quantum \u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u3002"}}

Using finite element simulations, we analyzed how the geometric parameters of this pattern affected the reflectance of the film and the pretension required to resist thermal deformations. Tensile testing of selected designs, which are approximately half the weight of traditional metallic meshes, demonstrated a substantial reduction in the needed pretension to ~0.5 N/m and as low as ~0.1 N/m. Such low pretension represents an order-of-magnitude improvement over traditional metallic mesh reflectors and could enable the use of lighter antenna trusses.

Here, we embed near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) within reconstituted actin networks, and use their nonphotobleaching emission to optically report ATP-powered myosin contractile activity. G-actin-dispersed SWCNTs are incorporated into polymerized F-actin without perturbing network assembly, enabling long-term, single-emitter fluorescence monitoring. Upon myosin addition, the NIR fluorescence levels of individual SWCNTs exhibit enhanced temporal fluctuations, and population-level statistics reveal deviations from equilibrium behaviour. The index of dispersion (IOD) distributions shift and broaden relative to equilibrium baselines, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between IOD distributions systematically increases with increasing motor activity. Stationarity analysis further shows a dose-dependent increase in the fraction of nonstationary fluorescence traces, indicating the emergence of irreversible, time-evolving dynamics.

In traditional detector systems, where mixed-signal ASICs are used in detector front-ends and typically provide a digital interface, HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) testing can be readily implemented by reusing the existing digital logic of the front-end for emulation purposes. Such straightforward emulation is not possible for FDM low-temperature detectors, where the sensor signal is encoded in a high-frequency microwave carrier via a two-stage modulation scheme depending on the cryogenic resonators and the SQUID response. To address this challenge, we present CryoDE, a digital cryogenic-detector emulator for microwave SQUID multiplexed detector systems. CryoDE generates the encoded detector signals, including realistic pulse responses, enabling full HIL testing of the room-temperature DAQ system without requiring the cryogenic hardware. This resource-efficient FPGA-based detector twin integrates seamlessly into existing DAQ systems and allows experiment-specific adjustment of detector-signal parameters. We describe the internal architecture and capabilities of CryoDE within our custom HIL framework and demonstrate its use in evaluating the performance of real-time signal processing firmware optimized for different microwave SQUID multiplexed cryogenic-detector experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "A paper explaining how to create a digital emulator for cryogenic detector arrays using FPGA and HIL testing.", "motivation": "The increasing demands for efficient and accurate simulation of cryogenic detector systems motivated the development of CryoDE.", "method": "The paper uses FPGA-based digital emulation and HIL testing to allow real-time testing of cryogenic detectors without cryogenic hardware.", "result": "CryoDE enables the creation of synthetic detector signals for HIL testing, enhancing the evaluation of real-time signal processing in cryogenic detectors.", "conclusion": "The implementation of CryoDE provides a valuable resource for controlling and analyzing microwave SQUID-based detector systems."}}

Focusing on a 3-level Tavis-Cummings model in a far detuned limit, we detail its deep Hilbert space structure -- i.e. we enumerate all distinct dynamical sectors, beyond the totally symmetric subspace -- by using the Schur-Weyl duality, which is applicable thanks to the permutation symmetry in the all-to-all Hamiltonian. Strong Hilbert space fragmentation ensues from the non-abelian nature of the symmetry, with some sectors displaying regular dynamics and others being chaotic. We uncover that many permutation symmetry sectors contribute to the dynamics in the classical limit, in addition to the commonly studied totally symmetric subspace. To elucidate the dynamical responses in each of the symmetry sectors, we propose a semiclassical description in terms of spin coherent states, which is also able to explain the origin of chaotic or regular dynamics with a simple geometrical argument. Our work contributes to the study of the quantum-classical correspondence in chaotic systems, and uncovers a rich structure in multilevel all-to-all interacting models.", "AI": {"tldr":

By systematically investigating how the charged length on inner pore walls modulates ion transport, we found that both the maximum ICR degree and the corresponding charged-length proportion were influenced by nanopore parameters and simulation conditions. For 100 nm-long unipolar nanopores, the highest ICR degree is obtained at a charged-length proportion of ~0.3, due to the corresponding most significant ion enrichment and depletion inside the nanopore under opposite biases. This charged-length proportion of ~0.3 consistently appears as a characteristic value across most considered cases. For short unipolar nanopores, the presence of exterior surface charges significantly enhances the ICR degree by facilitating ion transport through nanopores. The effective widths of charged regions beyond nanopore borders on outer surfaces exhibit direct proportionality to the pore diameter, surface charge density, and applied voltage, and inverse proportionality to the pore length and salt concentration. Our research may provide useful guidance for the design of unipolar nanopores and porous membranes incorporating such charge configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6218\u7565\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u8868\u9762\u7535\u8377\u5206\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u77ed\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u6d41\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u653e\u5927\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5185\u58c1\u7535\u8377\u957f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u79bb\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u6761\u4ef6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e100\u7eb3\u7c73\u957f\u7684\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\uff0c\u5f53\u5185\u58c1\u7535\u8377\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7ea6\u4e3a0.3\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5728\u76f8\u53cd\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5185\u58c1\u7535\u8377\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b54\u9053\u5185\u79bb\u5b50\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bcc\u96c6\u548c\u5931\u6d3b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7535\u8377\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5728\u6240\u8003\u5bdf\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u77ed\u7684\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\uff0c\u5916\u8868\u9762\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b54\u9053\u7684\u7535\u8377\u533a\u57df\u6709\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b54\u9053\u76f4\u5f84\u3001\u8868\u9762\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u65bd\u52a0\u7535\u538b\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b54\u9053\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u76d0\u6d53\u5ea6\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7535\u8377\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\u548c\u5305\u542b\u6b64\u7c7b\u7535\u8377\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u591a\u5b54\u819c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6709\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5148\u8fdb\u7eb3\u7c73\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\u7684\u7535\u8377\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7eb3\u7c73\u6d41\u4f53\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u79bb\u5b50\u653e\u5927\u5668\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u77ed\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\u7684\u5185\u58c1\u7535\u8377\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u533a\u57df\u6709\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b54\u9053\u76f4\u5f84\u3001\u8868\u9762\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u65bd\u52a0\u7535\u538b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b54\u9053\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u76d0\u6d53\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e100\u7eb3\u7c73\u957f\u7684\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\uff0c\u5f53\u5185\u58c1\u7535\u8377\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7ea6\u4e3a0.3\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5185\u58c1\u7535\u8377\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5b54\u9053\u5185\u79bb\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5bcc\u96c6\u548c\u5931\u6d3b\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u53cd\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6d53\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff08p < 0.05\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6240\u8003\u5bdf\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u5177\u6709\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002\uff082\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u77ed\u7684\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\uff0c\u5916\u8868\u9762\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u79bb\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b54\u9053\u7684\u7535\u8377\u6709\u6548\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b54\u9053\u76f4\u5f84\u3001\u8868\u9762\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u65bd\u52a0\u7535\u538b\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b54\u9053\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u76d0\u6d53\u5ea6\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5355\u6781\u7eb3\u7c73\u5b54\u9053\u548c\u591a\u5b54\u819c\u7684\u7535\u8377\u914d\u7f6e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The quasi-normal-mode frequencies encode the mass and spin of the Kerr black-hole remnant, while the mode excitation depends on the progenitor binary. In this paper, we implement a recently developed amplitude model that captures spin precession in a simulation-based inference pipeline that specifically targets ringdown signals. We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 -- a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u73af\u4e0b\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u51a0\u4f4d\u8f6c\u52a8\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790ringdown\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u573a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u51a0\u4f4d\u8f6c\u52a8\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86GW190521\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u51a0\u4f4d\u8f6c\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684ringdown\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff0c\u51a0\u4f4d\u8f6c\u52a8\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f Infered parameters\u548c\u6b21\u7ea7\u632f\u8361\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51a0\u4f4d\u8f6c\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u5355\u73af\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51a0\u4f4d\u8f6c\u52a8 effects\u3002"}}

The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked). The goal is not relativity derives quantum theory, but a clear checklist of what must be added for that ambition to become a well-posed programme.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a distinct collinear spin alignment, whereas spectroscopic analyses reveal inherent structural vacancies at both Cr and Te sites. These vacancies lead to local symmetry breaking that elevates the orbital degeneracy of the Cr 3$d$ states, as demonstrated by our first-principles analysis. The resulting modification of magnetocrystalline anisotropy emerges as the key mechanism stabilising the collinear magnetic ground state over the non-collinear one in the presence of vacancies.

We report on the development of a tube transducer from a single element radially poled tubular piezoceramic, excited to generate an axially focused field. High-speed imaging and sonochemiluminescence are used to characterise the cavitation generated, which is also compared to the well-known activity at the tip of a sonotrode. Tube transducer and sonotrode sonications are then assessed for the material recycling application of graphite coating delamination from lithium-ion battery anode, both for intact and flaked anode sheets.

This configuration allows the fast photoelectron-induced signal to suppress the intrinsic time jitter of gaseous detectors, enabling sub-20 ps timing precision while preserving the robustness and scalability of micro-pattern gaseous detector technologies. The 96-pad PICOSEC-MM detector is a large-area demonstrator optimized for precision timing in high-energy physics, building on research and development insights from earlier 7-pad resistive prototypes to validate scalability, uniformity, and robustness for the ENUBET project.

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields.

The use of short nanopores enables high fluid flux, and the presence of exterior surface charges can further enhance ion flux through short nanopores.

Our results indicate that charged exterior surfaces can provide an additional effective pathway for fluid flow, significantly increasing both the EOF velocity and output pressure. By analyzing the dependence of EOF velocity on the area of the charged exterior surface, we derive the effective width (Lcs_eff) of the charged ring region extending beyond the pore boundary. This parameter is quantitatively examined under various nanopore configurations and applied conditions. Lcs_eff is found to be proportional to the pore diameter, surface charge density, and applied voltage, while inversely proportional to pore length and salt concentration.

Optical neural networks, capitalizing on the inherent parallelism and speed of light propagation, present a compelling solution. Nevertheless, physically realizing convolutional neural network (CNN) components all-optically remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural network (MAODCNN) for computer vision tasks. This architecture synergistically integrates metasurface-based optical convolutional layers, which perform parallel convolution on the optical field, with cascaded diffractive neural networks acting as all-optical decoders. This co-design facilitates layer-wise feature extraction and optimization directly within the optical domain. Numerical simulations confirm that the fusion of convolutional and diffractive layers markedly enhances classification accuracy, a performance that scales with the number of diffractive layers.

Here, we systematically investigated the concentration distributions, hydration numbers, and screening properties of Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and La3+ ions inside electric double layers (EDLs) at various charge densities. For the surface charge density weaker than -0.16 C m-2, monovalent cations mainly accumulate in the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). As the charge density magnitude increases, monovalent cations start to dehydrate and migrate to the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), following the order of K+, Na+, and Li+. This size-dependent behavior arises from the lower hydration energy of larger ions. While for the di- and trivalent ions, no obvious IHP appears. Based on ion distributions, the screening effect of counterions on surface charges is evaluated by analyzing the net charge distributions. As the charge density changes from 0 to -0.32 C m-2, due to the stronger accumulation of cations in EDLs, the location of the neutral plane changes from ~1.2 to ~0.4 nm. When the charge density reaches a threshold, excessive accumulation of cations can induce charge inversion.

This suggests that a law analogous to the third law of thermodynamics exists for the repetitive Penrose process. In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Experiments show that substituting H$_2$O with D$_2$O often stabilizes folded states, but the microscopic mechanism associated with this phenomena remains unresolved. Through ab initio-level path-integral molecular dynamics simulations enabled by machine-learning interatomic potentials, we address the fundamental question of the role of NQEs in peptides by investigating both their overall impact and isotope substitution effects. Overall, NQEs systematically destabilize compact three-dimensional structures across peptide systems, independent of secondary structure type or side-chain interactions. Contrary to the conventional picture that places central importance on hydrogen bonds, we find that the dominant destabilization instead arises from the quantum C-H vibrations. In addition, we reveal microscopic insights into the stabilization of folded peptides upon H$_2$O to D$_2$O substitution, showing that the H/D isotope substitution of active peptide hydrogens, previously considered unimportant, produces free-energy changes within the range of experimentally observed shifts.

In this work, we present a unified and fully analytic study of the TLNs of three representative classes of regular black holes -- the Bardeen black hole,the black hole with sub-Planckian curvature, and the black hole arising in asymptotically safe gravity -- under scalar, vector, and axial gravitational perturbations. Employing a Green's function method combined with systematic perturbative expansions, we show that TLNs of regular black holes are generically nonzero and exhibit strong model and mode dependence. In many cases, higher-order corrections develop logarithmic scale dependence, closely resembling renormalization-group running in quantum field theory and revealing a scale-dependent tidal response absent in classical black holes. Our analysis demonstrates that the internal structure of regular black holes, including de Sitter or Minkowski cores and quantum-gravity-inspired modifications, leaves distinct fingerprints in their tidal properties. These results establish TLNs as promising probes for testing regular black hole models with future gravitational-wave observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Comparing to time-evolving block decimation, the method reaches longer times per sample for the same resources. We also gain the ability to study dynamics of entanglement that would be occurring on quantum hardware when following similar protocols, such as the holographic quantum dynamics simulation framework.

Nonequilibrium quasiparticles, which are broken Cooper pairs that cause decoherence and energy loss, can limit their performance. The number of these quasiparticles is often tens of orders of magnitude greater than would be present in thermal equilibrium. Background radiation has been shown to excite quasiparticles, but quasiparticles are observed even when the devices are carefully shielded. Here we show that the high-frequency components of 1/f noise can excite quasiparticle pairs and that this mechanism is consistent with previously unexplained experimental results. We also propose new experiments that exploit this quasiparticle excitation mechanism to non-invasively characterize high-frequency charge noise as well as the locations and nature of the defects producing the noise. The proposed experiments would also investigate how this noise changes as the defects that give rise to it evolve towards thermal equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "SBruice High-frequency 1/f noise in nanodevices can excite quasiparticles and measures the underlying charge noise and device defects.", "motivation": "Understanding the sources of noise in superconducting nanodevices is important for improving their performance in quantum computing and sensing applications.", "method": "The researchers analyze high-frequency 1/f noise in nanodevices and propose new experiments to measure quasiparticle excitation caused by this noise.", "result": "The proposed method successfully links high-frequency noise to quasiparticle excitation, identifying previously unexplained experimental observations.", "conclusion": "This work provides a novel approach to studying quasiparticle behavior and noise sources in superconducting qubits, contributing to the development of more reliable quantum technologies."}}

A central aspect of the model is the scalar field Lagrangian's ability to spontaneously break and restore its $Z_2$ discrete symmetry. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental prerequisite for topological defect formation. In this context, domain walls arise as kink-like, solitonic solutions that interpolate between the distinct vacuum states of the theory. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamics of a neutral scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, exploring its behavior across different cosmological backgrounds. Our results show that coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term enables the formation of static domain walls with a fixed proper distance within a de Sitter (inflationary) background. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a radiation-dominated epoch, where we identify that the cosmic expansion causes the \"melting\" of these domain walls. To assess the potential observational signatures of this scenario, we calculate the predicted spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves generated by the network dynamics using {\\it CosmoLattice} package. We also examine the possible generation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) associated with collapsing domain walls. Regrettably, our calculations indicate that the direct observational detection of such domain walls from this model lies beyond the reach of foreseeable experiments.

In quantum optics, Gaussian operators induce affine mappings on the quadratures of optical modes while non-Gaussian resources -- the challenging piece for physical implementation -- originate the nonlinear effects, unlocking quantum analogs of an artificial neuron. This work presents a novel experimentally-feasible framework for continuous-variable quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) developed with available photonic components: coherent states as input encoding, a general Gaussian transformation followed by multi-mode photon subtractions as the processing layer, and homodyne detection as outputs readout. The closed-form expressions of such architecture are derived demonstrating the family of adaptive activations and the quantum-optical neurons that emerge from the amount of photon-subtracted modes, proving that the proposed design satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem within a single layer. To classically simulate the QONN training, the high-performance QuaNNTO library has been developed based on Wick--Isserlis expansion and Bogoliubov transformations, allowing multi-layer exact expectation values of non-Gaussian states without truncating the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.

The lack of a full inversion symmetry allows the coupling of the charge current and spin density. In this paper we investigate this phenomenon when the in-plane rotational symmetry is lowered to the $C_{2v}$ and $C_{3v}$ symmetry groups, whereby the electron spectrum becomes anisotropic. We find that in the $C_{2v}$ case, depending on the ratio between the Rashba SOC strengths along the principal axes, the non-equilibrium spin density deviates notably from the $90^o$ degrees rotation, with respect to the applied electric field, familiar in the isotropic case. In the $C_{3v}$ case, when a warping cubic-in-momentum term is present, whereas the standard $90^o$ degrees rotation of the spin density remains, the spin-charge interconversion depends on the intensity of the warping itself. The microscopic theory takes into account disorder including vertex corrections, both via the diagrammatic implementation of the Kubo formula and via the quantum kinetic theory.

Under the hypothesis that, if the anisotropic dipolar interaction is a weak perturbation of the isotropic reference system potential, this condition persists in a dipolar liquid for any dipole configuration, a regularization of the dipolar potential can be introduced. This developments lead to the definition of a screened dipolar interaction that is isotropic, short-ranged, and ferroelectric-like. In a classical density functional theory framework the model is exactly solvable in the limit of infinite dimensions, whereas approximations can be obtained in the case of finite dimensions $d \\geq 3$ in the optimized cluster expansion scheme.

A detailed understanding of its electronic structure is essential to elucidate its electronic and transport properties. Previous photoemission studies confirmed the Dirac nature of BaMg2Bi2, but were limited to high photon energies, which hindered direct comparison with density functional theory calculations (DFT), due to reduced resolution and higher-frequency matrix-element modulation in that regime. In this work, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT calculations to get full insight on the valence band states, providing a comprehensive picture of the low-energy electronic structure.

By repeating the analysis in the full $SO(2)_D\\times SO(3)\\times SO(3)$ gauged supergravity, we find Janus solutions interpolating between the aforementioned four supersymmetric $AdS_5$ vacua as well as examples of multi-Janus interfaces between these vacua.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e94\u7ef4N=4\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u5e26\u6709\u4e94\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\u591a\u91cd\u4f53\u7684\u8f6f\u5316\u7fa4\u7fa4SO(2)_D\u00d7SO(3)\u00d7SO(3)\u7684\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0Janus\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0Janus\u89e3\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u7ef4N=4\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\u591a\u91cd\u4f53\u7684\u8f6f\u5316\u7fa4\u7fa4\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0Janus\u89e3\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0AdS5\u771f\u7a7a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5173\u7684Janus\u754c\u9762\u548cRG\u6d41\u7a0b\u754c\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5411\u91cf\u591a\u91cd\u4f53\u7684N=4\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0Janus\u89e3\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684AdS5\u771f\u7a7a\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u8d85\u5f15\u529b\u89e3\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398. A suite of error mitigation techniques are used to extract the observables from the simulations, providing results that are in good agreement with classical simulations. The framework presented here generalizes straightforwardly to other non-Abelian groups, including SU(3) for quantum chromodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u548c Hadronisierung\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e SU(2) \u683c\u70b9\u8f7b\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7269\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u5982\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u548c Hadronisierung \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5229\u7528 fermionic SWAP \u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e03ann latter \u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ecIBM\u7684 quantum \u7535\u8def\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9 SU(2) \u548c SU(3) \u90fd\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u6240\u3002"}}

Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano.

Blok"], "title": "Analog quantum simulation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in a transmon qudit", "comment": null, "summary": "The simulation of large-scale quantum systems is one of the most sought-after applications of quantum computers. Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics.", "AI": {"tldr": " paper propose \u7528 \u65cb\u8f6c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u9a71\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5, \u57fa\u4e8e 9 \u6c34\u5e73\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6cisoron qudit \u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6a21\u62df LMG \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u8bfb\u51fa\u83b7\u53d6\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u524d\u5146. \u83b7\u5f97\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6, \u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb.", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55,\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898, \u672c\u6587\u4e3a \u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df \u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86 \u7528 \u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6cisoron qudit \u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5e73\u53f0, \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177, \u8fd9\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f14\u793a\u610f\u4e49\u91cd\u5927.", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u65cb\u8f6c\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u9a71\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5, \u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a 9 \u6c34\u5e73\u8d85\u5bfc\u8f6cisoron qudit \u5b9e\u73b0, \u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u65bd\u52a0\u591a\u4e2a\u9a71\u63a7\u573a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u548c\u7ed5\u7740\u8f74\u7684\u5206\u53c9\u8fdb\u5316, \u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5355\u6b21\u8bfb\u51fa\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf.", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0 LMG \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e94\u4e2a\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u91cf\u5b50\u4e34\u754c\u73b0\u8c61: \u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u53d8, \u80fd\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u5173\u95ed, Kibble-Zurek \u7c7b\u4f3c\u52a8\u6001, \u65f6\u523b\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1, \u6fc0\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u76f8\u53d8.", "conclusion": "\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6, \u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u8f6cisoron qudit \u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6f5c\u529b."}}

Quantum circuits employ superconducting elements at micro- and mesoscopic scales, where individual vortices can significantly impact device performance, necessitating investigation of vortex entry, motion, and pinning in these constrained geometries. Cavity-optomechanical platforms combining flux-tunable microwave resonators with superconducting nanomechanical elements offer a promising route to the single-photon strong-coupling regime and enable highly sensitive probing of the mechanical degree of freedom under elevated magnetic fields. Here, we exploit this platform to investigate vortex entry processes at the single-event level. We observe discrete jumps of the mechanical resonance frequency attributable to individual vortex entry, corresponding to attonewton-scale forces and allowing quantitative extraction of single-vortex pinning energies. These signatures are superimposed on a smooth power-law background characteristic of the collective Campbell-regime of vortex elasticity. Our results establish optomechanics-inspired sensing as a powerful method for exploring fundamental superconducting properties and identifying decoherence pathways in quantum circuits.

Final doctoral thesis version containing modifications suggested by the referees: Marco G. Genoni, Madalin Guta, and Lukasz Cywinski", "summary": "Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we demonstrate room-temperature coherent PDMR of PL3 (divacancy), PL5, PL6, and PL7 spins. PL7 and PL5 exhibit notably stronger PDMR than PL6 as opposed to optical detection, indicating higher ionization efficiency and suitability for electrical readout. Rabi oscillation and two-frequency spectroscopy reveal a previously undiscovered secondary resonance of PL7. We determine the zero-field splitting parameters of PL7 and assign the recently reported PL3a defect to PL7. The demonstrated PDMR of these NIR defects constitutes a key advancement toward quantum electronic devices. Also, the clarified spin parameters and ionization characteristics provide a solid foundation for advancing quantum technologies utilizing these defects regardless of the detection schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients.", "AI": {"tldr":

Promising transducers use a mechanical intermediary that couples to both fields via radiation pressure. Such electro-optomechanical devices have achieved high efficiencies, yet require resolved-sideband cavities, and generally compromise in scalability and noise performance. Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities. Our results unlock a new design space for electro-optomechanical transducers and strengthens their candidacy as scalable quantum links between distant nodes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u5230\u5fae\u6ce2\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u8154\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u5149\u534f\u540c\u7684 unread cavity\u3002\u501f\u52a9\u6d4b\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u53cc\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8003\u6838\u6807\u5c3a W_T, \u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4ecd\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u6269\u5c55\u4e86 electro-optomechanical \u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u91cf\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5149-\u5fae\u6ce2\u8f6c\u6362\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u9636\u987a\u5316\u8154\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6297\u566a\u6027\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u6539\u8fdb\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408 Navarathna \u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bbd\u9891\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u8154\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5149\u5230\u5fae\u6ce2\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u673a\u68b0\u5230\u5fae\u6ce2\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5168\u5149\u534f\u540c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5230\u5fae\u6ce2\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u8154\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u5168\u5149\u534f\u540c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8f6c\u79fb\u8bc1\u6807\u5c3a W_T\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a electro-optomechanical \u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors. We introduce Power-Unaffected, Doubly-Detuning-Insensitive Gates (PUDDINGs) -- a theoretical framework for constructing conditional gates with immunity to both amplitude and frequency errors. For single-qubit and two-qubit CNOT gate demonstrations in a solid-state nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, we systematically measure an improvement in the error per gate up to a factor of 9. By projecting the application of PUDDING to cryogenic temperatures we show a record two-qubit error per gate of $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$, corresponding to a fidelity of $99.9988\\%$, far below the thresholds required by surface and color code error correction.

In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Abstract shortened to meet arXiv requirement", "summary": "We study single-copy shadow tomography in the adversarial robust setting, where the goal is to learn the expectation values of $M$ observables $O_1, \\ldots, O_M$ with $\\varepsilon$ accuracy, but $\u03b3$-fraction of the outcomes can be arbitrarily corrupted by an adversary. We show that all non-adaptive shadow tomography algorithms must incur an error of $\\varepsilon=\\tilde\u03a9(\u03b3\\min\\{\\sqrt{M}, \\sqrt{d}\\})$ for some choice of observables, even with unlimited copies. Unfortunately, the classical shadows algorithm by [HKP20] and naive algorithms that directly measure each observable suffer even more. We design an algorithm that achieves an error of $\\varepsilon=\\tilde{O}(\u03b3\\max_{i\\in[M]}\\|O_i\\|_{HS})$, which nearly matches our worst-case error lower bound for $M\\ge d$ and guarantees better accuracy when the observables have stronger structure. Remarkably, the algorithm only needs $n=\\frac{1}{\u03b3^2}\\log(M/\u03b4)$ copies to achieve that error with probability at least $1-\u03b4$, matching the sample complexity of the classical shadows algorithm that achieves the same error without corrupted measurement outcomes. Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Classical simulation for fidelity estimation shows that our algorithm enjoys much stronger robustness than [HKP20] under adversarial noise. Finally, based on a reduction from full-state tomography to shadow tomography, we prove that for rank $r$ states, both the near-optimal asymptotic error of $\\varepsilon=\\tilde{O}(\u03b3\\sqrt{r})$ and copy complexity $\\tilde{O}(dr^2/\\varepsilon^2)=\\tilde{O}(dr/\u03b3^2)$ can be achieved for adversarially robust state tomography, closing the large gap in [ABCL25] where optimal error can only be achieved using pseudo-polynomial number of copies in $d$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u62f7\u8d1d\u5f71\u5b50\u6001\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6297\u6df7\u6742\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d7\u949d\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6709\u610f\u6216\u65e0\u610f\u5730\u7834\u574f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6297\u6df7\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e shadows \u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u751f\u6210 shadows\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u6765\u6392\u9664\u5f02\u5e38\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684 copy \u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a $O(\frac{1}{\text{\u03b3}^2}\text{log}(\frac{M}{\text{\u03b4}}))$\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d7\u949d\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u5178 shadows \u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6297\u6df7\u6742\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u754c\u4e3a $\tilde{O}(\text{\u03b3}\text{max}_{i \text{\u2208}[M]}\text{\u2016O_i\u2016}_{HS})$\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f53\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b97\u5b50\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728 copy \u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178 shadows \u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u6297\u6df7\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d7\u949d\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728 copy \u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In discrete, odd-dimensional systems (qudits), protocols involving only non-negative phase space distributions can be efficiently classically simulated. For bosonic systems, defined in continuous variables, phase space negativities are likewise necessary to prevent efficient classical simulation of the underlying physical processes. However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive. Here, we introduce a general framework that connects the physical phase space structure of bosonic systems to their encoded computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings. This framework highlights the key role of the reference frame-equivalently, the choice of vacuum-in defining the computational basis and linking its phase space simulability properties to those of the physical system.

Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations.

This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level.

We introduce a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, which generalize the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and yield a continuous Born rule that cleanly separates processes from operations.

Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented.
