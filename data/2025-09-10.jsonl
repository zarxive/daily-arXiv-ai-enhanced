However, conventional\nsimulation techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM) and\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD), face challenges in accurately modeling\nTHz wave propagation. These difficulties arise from the broad operating\nbandwidth of THz-TDS (~0.1-10 THz), which demands extremely high temporal\nresolution to capture pulse dynamics and fine spatial resolution to resolve\nmicrostructures and interface effects. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into THz-TDS modeling for\nthe first time. Through a comprehensive analysis of forward problems in the\ntime domain, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of PINNs as a\npowerful framework for advancing THz wave simulation and analysis."}

Electronic-photonic\nintegrated circuits (EPICs) have emerged as a compelling platform for\nnext-generation AI systems, offering inherent advantages in ultra-high\nbandwidth, low latency, and energy efficiency for computing and\ninterconnection. Beyond performance, EPICs also hold unique promises for\nsustainability. Fabricated in relaxed process nodes with fewer metal layers and\nlower defect densities, photonic devices naturally reduce embodied carbon\nfootprint (CFP) compared to advanced digital electronic integrated circuits,\nwhile delivering orders-of-magnitude higher computing performance and\ninterconnect bandwidth. To further advance the sustainability of photonic AI\nsystems, we explore how electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) and\ncross-layer co-design methodologies can amplify these inherent benefits. We\npresent how advanced EPDA tools enable more compact layout generation, reducing\nboth chip area and metal layer usage. We will also demonstrate how cross-layer\ndevice-circuit-architecture co-design unlocks new sustainability gains for\nphotonic hardware: ultra-compact photonic circuit designs that minimize chip\narea cost, reconfigurable hardware topology that adapts to evolving AI\nworkloads, and intelligent resilience mechanisms that prolong lifetime by\ntolerating variations and faults. By uniting intrinsic photonic efficiency with\nEPDA- and co-design-driven gains in area efficiency, reconfigurability, and\nrobustness, we outline a vision for lifelong-sustainable electronic-photonic AI\nsystems. This perspective highlights how EPIC AI systems can simultaneously\nmeet the performance demands of modern AI and the urgent imperative for\nsustainable computing."}

In the framework of semi-stable degenerations, such limits are\ncharacterised by a simple fibration structure of the fastest vanishing\nthree-cycles. The previously studied Hodge theoretic classification of infinite\ndistance limits of type II, III, and IV is reflected in the number of\none-cycles of the shrinking fibres. Complementing our recent work on limits of\ntype II, we focus here on type III and type IV degenerations. Based on\neffective field theory considerations, these are expected to be\ndecompactification limits to 6d and 5d, respectively. However, establishing the\nexistence of the associated Kaluza-Klein tower(s) of states with both the\nappropriate mass scaling and the correct degeneracy requires explicit geometric\ninput. We show that the aforementioned vanishing three-cycles are special\nLagrangian three-tori, thus giving rise to towers of asymptotically massless\nBPS particles from multi-wrapped D3-branes with the degeneracy of a\nKaluza-Klein tower. We furthermore relate the BPS index of these three-cycles\nto the Euler characteristic of the threefold. Finally, we systematically\nanalyse infinite distance trajectories in multi-parameter limits described by\nso-called enhancement chains. We find that the primary singularity type encodes\nthe gravitational duality frame of the limit whereas the secondary singularity\ntype is related to the rank of the gauge group coupled to gravity. The\nspecifics of the asymptotic physics depend crucially on whether or not the\ntrajectory is induced by the backreaction of an EFT string."}

This detector prototypes a new modular\ndesign for a liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC), comprised of a\ntwo-by-two array of four modules, each further segmented into two\noptically-isolated LArTPCs. The 2x2 Demonstrator features a number of\npioneering technologies, including a low-profile resistive field shell to\nestablish drift fields, native 3D ionization pixelated imaging, and a\nhigh-coverage dielectric light readout system. The 2.4 tonne active mass\ndetector is flanked upstream and downstream by supplemental solid-scintillator\ntracking planes, repurposed from the MINERvA experiment, which track ionizing\nparticles exiting the argon volume. The antineutrino beam data collected by the\ndetector over a 4.5 day period in 2024 include over 30,000 neutrino\ninteractions in the LAr active volume-the first neutrino interactions reported\nby a DUNE detector prototype. During its physics-quality run, the 2x2\nDemonstrator operated at a nominal drift field of 500 V/cm and maintained good\nLAr purity, with a stable electron lifetime of approximately 1.25 ms. This\npaper describes the detector and supporting systems, summarizes the\ninstallation and commissioning, and presents the initial validation of\ncollected NuMI beam and off-beam self-triggers. In addition, it highlights\nobserved interactions in the detector volume, including candidate muon\nanti-neutrino events."}

Here we consider the\nanalytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that\ncomplex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We\napply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour\nfor dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the\namplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and\nlocation of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex\nplane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\\rightarrow 0^+$, we\nshow how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV\nequation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed\nas they move from their initial position is of $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while\nthe direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a\nPainlev\\'{e} II (P$_{\\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\\'{e}e\nsolutions. The well-known $N$-soliton solutions of KdV correspond to rational\nsolutions of P$_{\\mathrm{II}}$ with a finite number of singularities;\notherwise, we postulate that infinitely many complex-plane singularities of KdV\nsolutions are born at each double-pole singularity of the initial condition. We\nalso provide asymptotic results for some non-generic cases in which\nsingularities propagate more slowly than in the generic case. Our study makes\nprogress towards the goal of providing a complete description of KdV solutions\nin the complex plane and, in turn, of relating this behaviour to the solution\non the real line."}

The quantum yield for this photochemical\nreaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process.\nPrevious theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation\nproceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However,\nexperimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies\nhave probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is\nunlikely to leave clear signatures.

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach to engineer large coupling between localized surface\nplasmons (LSPs) in CdO and localized surface phonon polaritons (LSPhP) in\nsapphire. By developing a successful dry etching protocol for CdO, we fabricate\nstripe arrays with tunable sizes, allowing the spectral alignment between the\nLSP and LSPhP modes. We demonstrate both experimentally and numerically that\nwhen these polaritons become resonant, hybrid modes emerge, resulting in\ncoupling. Finite element simulations reveal near-field enhancements exceeding a\nfactor of 1000, spatially extended hundreds of nanometers around the etched\nstructures. Our approach bridges the plasmonic and phononic responses of two\nmid-IR active materials, paving the way for scalable, high-performance infrared\nsensing platforms."}

To solve this problem we define the system action and\napply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines\nthe equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be\nincreased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same\nunit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an\noptimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth,\nwhile equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this\nmethod does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at\ndifferent pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve\ngains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase\nmatching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998\njunctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal\nsub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can\nstill be achieved at sub-optimal sizes."}

Neutron diffraction\nmeasurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the\neasy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order\ninteractions.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular.

Pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that\nare inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that\nmeasurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to\nshort pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noises originating\nfrom field pulses. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of\nlight polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to\nbecome a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range\nof materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed\nfields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE\nmeasurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new\nmethod to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse\nwidth. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber\nfixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the\nhigh-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac\ninterferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE of various ferromagnetic or\nferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, largely extending limits of\npreviously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials."}

To overcome this\nproblem, we formulate and prove a generalized quantum Stein's lemma directly\nfor CQ channels, by developing CQ-channel counterparts of the core proof\ntechniques used in the state setting. Building on this result, we construct a\nreversible QRT framework for CQ channel conversion that does not require the\nasymptotic continuity assumption, and show that this framework applies to the\nanalysis of channel coding scenarios. These results establish a fully general\ntoolkit for CQ channel discrimination and conversion, enabling their broad\napplication to core conversion problems for this fundamental class of channels."}

Even though this\nmethod does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at\ndifferent pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve\ngains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase\nmatching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998\njunctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal\nsub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can\nstill be achieved at sub-optimal sizes."}
