### [1] [Theoretical and experimental study of the correlation between pulsed light repetition frequency and electric field measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18629)
*Ke Di,Chenglin Ye,Yijie Du,Meihui Liu,Pengfei Shi,Yu Liu,Jiajia Du,Jun He*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to enhance Rydberg atom sensors by optimizing the repetition frequency of pulsed lasers, showing significant gains at 66MHz and 88MHz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on improving the performance of Rydberg atom sensors, which are important for various applications including sensing in communication frequencies.

Method: The method involves using pulsed lasers with MHz-level repetition frequencies to excite Rydberg atoms, and then measuring the sensor's response to external electric fields.

Result: The study shows that increasing the repetition frequency of pulsed lasers leads to higher measurement sensitivity and gain effects, particularly at 66MHz and 88MHz.

Conclusion: By leveraging pulsed light for Rydberg atom excitation, the paper demonstrates a novel approach to fabricating more sensitive atomic sensors with enhanced performance in critical communication bands.

Abstract: We innovatively propose a method to improve the performance of Rydberg atom
sensors based on the repetition frequency of pulsed lasers, which is verified
in experiments. Rydberg atoms excited by pulsed lasers are influenced
significantly by the repetition frequency of the pulsed laser on the Rydberg
state population. As the number of Rydberg atoms increases, the measurement
sensitivity of the sensor to external fields also increases, directly enhancing
the performance of the sensor. This paper investigates the response of the
sensor to the same electric field when the repetition frequency of the pulsed
laser is at the MHz level, with a focus on its gain effects on the broadcast
communication frequency bands of 66MHz and 88MHz. This study validates the
unique advantages of pulsed light for Rydberg atom excitation, improving the
effective detection of weak signals and providing a new approach for
fabricating more sensitive atomic sensors.

Motivation:  The motivation was likely to develop a biosensor with high sensitivity for label-free diagnostics in biochemical and medical fields.

Method:  The researchers used a genetic algorithm with Ansys Lumerical FDTD simulations to optimize the sensor's design.

Result:  The optimized sensor achieved a sensitivity of 1276 nm/RIU, FWHM of 11.89 nm, quality factor of 221, and a figure of merit of 107 RIU1.

Conclusion:  The sensor shows promise for precise detection of small refractive index changes in label-free diagnostics.

Abstract: We numerically design a hybrid plasmonic dielectric refractive index
biosensor comprising ametal insulator metal (MIM) bus waveguide evanescently
coupled to a silicon core resonator. The geometry is optimized with a genetic
algorithm (GA) using Ansys Lumerical FDTD simulations, targeting maximal
sensitivity and figure of merit while minimizing the resonance linewidth. The
optimized device achieves a sensitivity of 1276 nm/RIU, a full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of 11.89nm, a quality factor of 221, and a figure of merit of
107 RIU1 (defined as S/FWHM). These results demonstrate precise discrimination
of small refractive index variations and support the sensors applicability to
label free biochemical and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: The LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment is searching for dark matter interactions in a
liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXe-TPC). This article demonstrates how
control of the flow state in the LXe-TPC enables the identification of pairs of
sequential alpha-decays, which are used to map fluid flow and ion drift in the
liquid target. The resulting transport model is used to tag $^{214}$Pb
beta-decays, a leading background to dark matter signals in LZ. Temporally
evolving volume selections, at a cost of 9.0% of exposure, target the decay of
each $^{214}$Pb atom up to 81 minutes after production, resulting in (63 $\pm$
6$_{\mathrm{stat}}$ $\pm$ 7$_{\mathrm{sys}}$)% identification of $^{214}$Pb
decays to ground state. We also demonstrate how flow-based tagging techniques
enable a novel calibration side band that is concurrent with science data.

Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic
modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly
unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not
efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based
separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly
than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists
in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not
proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates
of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$
low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with
odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of
interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity
relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong
additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even
staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle
scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the
static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode
structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like
regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via
transport measurements.

Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and
unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear
magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy
for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric
monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an
in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting
originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling,
and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit
time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our
framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The
resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring
topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall
conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a
pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in
altermagnetic systems.

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the
realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning
probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of
surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in
multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures,
states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal
detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and
interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a
glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts
the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW
heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform
layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in
double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here
the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of
microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases
in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane
offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative
quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we
extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap
sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes
beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and
screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that
the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a
wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from
fractional Chern insulators in Moir\'e superlattices to correlated states in
multilayer graphene.

Abstract: We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective
models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC
Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain
Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with
parameters obtained from Pad\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We
provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical
expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain
limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient
simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer
ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains
reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and
out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of
double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While
half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular
phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are
entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are
captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase
diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results
demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for
exploring complex SC nanostructures.

*F. J. Rodríguez,L. Quiroga,N. F. Johnson*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Twisted light (TL) provides a powerful tool to study symmetry resolved transitions in quantum confined nanostructures. A TL pulse excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field. An effective electron-electron potential of the form 1/r^n is used to include image charge effects in layered systems. For n = 2, the system exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and angular momentum resolved absorption. The bare Coulomb 1/r interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light-driven excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise symmetry-forbidden. TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem, exposing internal excitations through multi-quanta orbital processes. Our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations, symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems, uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.

Motivation: 随着Te二维材料在光电和电子领域的快速发展，其晶向异质性的控制对于集成和应用至关重要。现有的合成方法对晶向控制能力有限，限制了大规模集成。因此，提供新的晶向控制方法成为研究焦点。

Abstract: Tellurium (Te), a two-dimensional material with pronounced structural
anisotropy, exhibits exceptional electrical and optical properties that are
highly sensitive to its crystallographic orientation. However, conventional
synthesis techniques offer limited control over the in-plane alignment of Te's
crystallographic c-axis, hindering large-scale integration. Here, we report a
novel, non-contact method to dynamically manipulate the c-axis orientation of
Te thin films using linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses. We show that
the c-axis can be omnidirectionally reoriented perpendicular to the laser
polarization, even in initially polycrystalline films. This reorientation is
fully reversible, allowing for rewritable and spatially selective control of
the c-axis orientation post-deposition. Our light-driven approach enables
programmable anisotropy in Te, opening new avenues for reconfigurable
optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as active metasurfaces and
CMOS-compatible architectures.

Abstract: Chirality of spin waves offers an advantageous binary carrier for data
transmission and processing with ultrafast dynamics and low power consumption.
Altermagnets possess intrinsic chirality-splitting spin waves and vanishing net
magnetization, thus emerging as ideal platforms to host chirality bits.
However, active control of the chiral states remains a key challenge for
realizing logic operations in chirality-based circuits. Here, we propose a
novel scheme for reversibly switching spin-wave chirality in altermagnets
between right- and left-handedness by tuning spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
strength. Specifically, for in-plane spin polarization, SOC hybridizes with the
altermagnetism, which induces a momentum-dependent competition. The
chirality-splitting structure of spin waves is dominated by either SOC or
altermagnetism in different Brillouin zone regions, allowing chirality
switching by altering their relative strength. An experimental design utilizing
an antiferromagnetic substrate to induce SOC and a heavy-metal stripe for
chirality detection is proposed. Our work establishes a novel pathway for
controlling spin-wave chirality in altermagnets via SOC, laying the groundwork
for developing spintronic devices utilizing switchable chiral spin waves as
dynamic information carriers.

TL;DR: The paper showcases the use of optical control to manipulate the topology of zero-field fractional Chern insulators, specifically twisted MoTe₂ bilayers, by controlling ferromagnetic polarization, enabling switches between integer and fractional quantum Hall states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to harness optical methods for precise control of topological states in materials, with potential applications in quantum spintronics, memory devices, and exotic quantum states.

Method: The researchers used circularly polarized optical pumping to manipulate the ferromagnetic polarization of twisted MoTe₂ bilayers at different optical excitation powers, achieving control through electrically tuned state transitions and helicity selective pumping.

Result: The system demonstrated on-demand ferromagnetic state preparation and direct optical switching of polarization, linked to gap-enhanced valley polarization, enabling spatially resolvable manipulation of topological order.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for optical control of topological many-body systems, offering new avenues for quantum device engineering and topological state manipulation.

Abstract: Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron
correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological
impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field
fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized
anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign
of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic
polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the
CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic
polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical
pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand
preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e.,
electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable
ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With
increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of
ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature.
Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective
near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of
photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically
switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved
measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a
CI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological
quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological
spintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by
programmable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains.

Conclusion: 该研究为设计新型带结构材料提供了有价值的理论框架。

Abstract: We investigate an interesting interplay of destructive interference due to
lattice geometry and band folding due to enlargement of the Brillouin zone in
generating and subsequently modifying the band topology in a twisted bilayer
$\alpha$-$T_3$ system. The pronounced degeneracy of the emergent flat band in
the dice limit of the $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice is removed on alignment with h-BN
layers, resulting in the formation of sub-bands with varying topological
characteristics. Remarkably, while the sub-band near charge neutrality exhibits
a trivial behavior, a topologically non-degenerate singular sub-band emerges
away from charge neutrality. The topological band remains isolated from the
rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\alpha - \theta$ plane (where
$\alpha$ and $\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle
respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the
aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study
the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to
characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of
flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\alpha$ and
$\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band
folding on the width of the topological band.

### [13] [Theoretical investigation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Potassium Tri-vanadium Pentantimonide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18692)
*Partha Goswami*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in a Kagome metal system by including higher-order hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), exchange field due to magnetic proximity, and charge density wave effects. A phase-dependent momentum-space orbital magnetic flux mimics SOC, enabling the emergence of chiral edge states and quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but the system's overall topology is not fully protected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The QAHE is a unique electronic phenomenon with potential applications in spintronics and quantum information processing. While topological insulators and conventional two-dimensional materials exhibit the QAHE, Kagome metal systems, which combine geometric frustration with strong spin-orbit coupling, have not been thoroughly explored in this context.

Method: Theoretical investigation of a nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping model with Rashba SOC, exchange field from magnetic proximity, and charge density wave effects. The model is analyzed in momentum space to identify Chern numbers and edge states.

Result: The system hosts multiple bands with Chern numbers suggesting weak topological properties. Upon introducing momentum-dependent SOC-like effects, two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers, leading to quantized anomalous Hall conductance and chiral edge states. The system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical framework for realizing the QAHE in Kagome metal systems by incorporating frustrated geometry and strong spin-orbit coupling effects. The findings suggest potential experimental routes to observe this phenomenon, contributing to the development of novel quantum materials and spintronic applications.

Abstract: The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the
quantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands
and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic
ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible
exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating
tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall
effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next
nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to
magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with
these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern
numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but
showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing
momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the
momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands
in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the
emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest
remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.

Abstract: Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power
limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR < 0.3%) of
ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic
antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure
[Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance
(GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe
SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe
free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% -
exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation.
Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic
resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc
current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics
from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC
substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates
current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks
are observed at 820 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by
external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This
work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic
oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and
coherent RF communication applications.

Abstract: Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for
information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for
imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in
solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the
magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection
frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature.
Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the
spin-wave control fields -- selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy
axes orthogonal to the film magnetization -- and by using color centers in
diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We
demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic
half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin
textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish
color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave
technologies.

Abstract: We present direct observation of the ring-down dynamics in the rotating frame
of a resonantly driven single-mode nonlinear nanomechanical resonator. An
additional close to resonance harmonic force excites nonlinear oscillations
about the fixed point in the rotating frame. When the secondary drive is
removed, we measure decay of the in-phase and quadrature components toward this
fixed point. We show that the decay of the in-phase signal is non-exponential,
even though the vibration amplitude decays exponentially if both forces are
switched off. A minimalistic model captures these dynamics as well as the
spectrum of the vibrations excited by the additional force, relating them to
the dissipation-induced symmetry breaking of the dynamics in the rotating
frame.

Abstract: We investigate Coulomb drag in a system of two capacitively coupled
superconducting nanowires. In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a
stationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to
the active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage
fluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and
semiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the
induced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By
contrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator
transition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite
drag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag
in short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires.
A semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical
origin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents
complete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of
mass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new
routes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality.

Abstract: Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically
tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology to superconductivity.
However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron
systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate
all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant
ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat
valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated
phases at various moir\'e lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and
ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these
phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive
polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only
constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a
ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the
possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the
way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum
circuits.

Abstract: Multipole moments serve as order parameters for characterizing higher-order
magnetic effects in momentum space, providing a framework to describe diverse
magnetic responses by extending the concept of magnetism. In this letter, we
introduce a methodology to quantitatively determine the multipole moment
contributions in anomalous Hall effect through angle-dependent anomalous Hall
current, with explicit incorporation of discrete crystal symmetries. Our
technique uniquely enables the investigation of octupole contribution in
non-periodic systems, particularly at interfaces and surfaces. Typically, in
(Ag$_{2}$Fe$_{5}$)$_{n}$ multilayers with quantum-well-engineered $k$-point
selectivity, we observe an octupole-dominated anomalous Hall effect in
conventional ferromagnetic materials, through first-principles calculations.
These results fundamentally challenge the existing theoretical understanding of
the anomalous Hall effect, showing that even the conventional contribution
arises not only from the dipole moment (net magnetization). Furthermore, we
establish practical control over the octupole contribution through two distinct
approaches: interface engineering and magnetic ordering reconfiguration,
opening new possibilities for manipulating higher-order transport effects.

Abstract: Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for
advancing nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium
iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a
cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on
gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice
matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms
detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a
study of magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a
500$\,\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate,
a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\,$mK, we compare the damping
characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG
reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains
low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$,
which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to
the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\,$mK, with no significant
temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the
low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins,
prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an
ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for
the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: Topological materials are characterized by integer invariants that underpin
their robust quantized electronic features, as famously exemplified by the
Chern number in the integer quantum Hall effect. Yet, in most candidate
systems, the observable linked to the topological invariant is unknown,
preventing direct verification of their topological nature. Here we present a
general method to identify topological materials by analyzing the local
electronic density, $\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})$, and connecting it to Atiyah
Singer index theorems. This approach enables a direct measurement of the
winding number, the topological invariant of Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry,
through a contour independent dislocation pattern of $\delta
\rho(\boldsymbol{r})$ created by interference from topological defects. Our
method thus provides a direct route to detect and characterize quantum
topological states, paving the way for their use as robust and entangleable
building blocks in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically
coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms
for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing
applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure
high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We
present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with
focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully
characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly
measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin
coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient
of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin
dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling.
Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee
the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor
resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.

Abstract: The frequency exponent of 1/f noise in graphene-boron nitride
heterostructures is known to have multiple extrema in its dependence on the
charge carrier concentration. This behavior is explained in the present paper
as a result of the charge carrier trapping by impurities in the boron nitride.
A kinetic equation for the charge carriers subject to trapping and interacting
with acoustic phonons is derived. This equation is solved numerically, and the
equilibrium solutions are used to evaluate the frequency exponent according to
the quantum theory of 1/f noise. It is found that the frequency exponent does
develop several minima and maxima, provided that the trapping probability is
sufficiently wide and has a threshold with respect to the charge carrier
energy. A detailed comparison with the experimental data is made, and the
results are used to estimate the energy threshold and the trapping
cross-section.

TL;DR: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a promising material for strained-layer van der Waals heterostructures with chirally ordered structures and topological properties. This work presents the synthesis of high-quality Te monolayers and multilayers with controlled thickness and their applications in spintronic and superconducting circuits. Strong spin-orbit coupling and anisotropic valley-dependent transport are evidence of the material's unique properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of ultrasensitive, low-power devices for quantum information and spintronics has driven the search for novel 2D materials with exceptional spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and anisotropic valley-dependent transport. Tellurium, a chiral crystal material similar to graphene, is being investigated for its potential in these applications, particularly in high-throughput synthesis of strained-layer van der Waals heterostructures.

Method: In this work, 2D tellurium flake devices with varying thickness (17 to 30 nm) were fabricated and their quantum transport properties studied. Transport measurements were performed down to 50 mK, and carbon nanotube-based strain gauges were used to monitor the device thickness in real time.

Result: The results show that thicker Te flake devices exhibit lower hole mobility (1000 cm²/V·s vs. 3000–4000 cm²/V·s in thinner devices) with Coulomb blockade observed in low carrier density, while the F-P interference becomes more pronounced at higher densities in the thicker flake. In the thinner flake device, the F-P visibility is significantly increased. A magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the F-P peaks, demonstrating the potential for high-spin, low-power spintronic applications. The strong spin-orbit coupling observed in the thin Te flakes suggests their potential use in topological superconductors.

Conclusion: The single and bilayered tellurium devices exhibit strong spin-orbit coupling, anisotropic valley-dependent transport, and F-P oscillations, which are quantum signatures of the beneficial properties in the highly ordered single-layer and bilayer architectures. The high quality of Te layers and their unique properties make them promising materials for exploring future spintronic and superconducting devices leveraging the advantages of valley-dependent electronic and superconducting properties.

Abstract: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its
interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties.
Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of
devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole
mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At
deep cryogenic temperatures (< 50mK), the transport characteristics transition
from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced
Fabry-P\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility
of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake
device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of
the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed
underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a
promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as
topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.

Abstract: For several decades it has been known that divergences arise in the
ground-state energy and chemical potential of unitary superfluids, where the
scattering length diverges, due to particle-hole scattering. Leading textbooks
and research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them
due to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a
solution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels
originating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in
weighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this
idea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a
long-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree,
Fock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase
diagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative
corrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase
for weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in
addition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle
physics.

Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics driven by the scattering from
next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections in the quantum field theory has
stationary solutions for the particle distribution characterized as the
Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points. The dynamics of the spatially
homogeneous, isotropic dilute ultra-cold Fermi gas is investigated, and its
kinetic equation confirms the Kolmogorov-type non-thermal fixed points in the
perturbation theory by the quasi-particle assumption, in contrast to the wave
turbulence of the weakly coupled ultra-cold Bose gas. In addition, other
stationary states are found without the quasi-particle assumption and in a
strongly coupled system. These analytical solutions provide chances for future
experiments and numerical simulations in search of far-from-equilibrium
stationary states of the dilute system.

Abstract: The formation and properties of a supersolid structure in a three-component
ultracold Bose gas mixture at T=0 are investigated theoretically. The system
consists of 23Na, 39K, and 41K atomic species, in which the binary mixtures of
(23Na,39K) and (39K,41K) can form self-bound quantum droplets stabilized by
quantum fluctuations. Two such droplets can bind together by the shared 39K
component, forming a stable "dimer" structure, which displays vibrational modes
analogous to a classical diatomic molecule. A simple protocol is proposed to
create a stable linear chain formed by periodic repetition of this basic
building block, i.e. an alternating sequence of (23Na,39K) and (39K,41K)
droplets. This structure exhibits both periodic density modulations from the
droplet ordering and global phase coherence due to the shared 39K component,
satisfying the criteria for supersolidity, and therefore adding another system
to the gallery of supersolid structures in cold atoms arena. The low-energy
excitation spectrum, probed by density perturbations, identifies modes
corresponding to droplet vibrations close to the ones expected from a classical
diatomic chain.

TL;DR: ionic transport in nanofluidic channels is promising for single-molecule analysis, manipulation, and energy harvesting. Challenges include precise control, which this work addresses using a moS2 siln nanochannel architecture for osmotic power generation and single molecule detection through gate voltage tuning, and fabrication method involving focused ion beam milling and dry transfer.

Motivation: with advancements in nanotechnology and energy harvesting, understanding and controlling ionic transport in nanofluidic channels is crucial for diverse applications

Method: focused ion beam (fib) milling and dry transfer method was used to fabricate sub 10 nm thick moS2 siln nanochannels with preserved electronic properties. the gate voltage influence on ionic conductance was studied through voltage modulation experiments. osmotic energy harvesting was demonstrated by applying a salt concentration gradient, and single molecule detection was tested using bovine serum albumin.

Result: the results show gate voltage tuning modulates ion selectivity, proof of concept for osmotic energy harvesting, and reliable single molecule detection with long dwell times, indicating the potential of moS2 siln nanochannels as tunable nanofluidic platforms.

Conclusion: this study introduces a novel architecture for controlling ion transport in nanofluidic channels, demonstrating applications in nanoscale fluidics, single molecule sensing, and energy harvesting through osmotic gradients, highlighting its potential for tunable and functional nanoscale devices

Abstract: Ionic transport in nanofluidic channels holds great promise for applications
such as single-molecule analysis, molecular manipulation, and energy
harvesting. However, achieving precise control over ion transport remains a
major challenge. In this work, we introduce a MoS2 SiN hybrid nanochannel
architecture that enables electrical tuning of ionic transport via external
gating, and we examine its potential for osmotic power generation and single
molecule detection. To fabricate the channels, we employed a combined focused
ion beam (FIB) milling and dry transfer method, producing sub 10 nm thick
structures while preserving the structural integrity and electronic properties
of MoS2, essential for reliable surface charge modulation. We first
investigated how the gate voltage influences ionic conductance, finding
evidence of gate dependent modulation of ion selectivity under different bias
polarities. Next, by applying a salt concentration gradient across the
nanochannels, we demonstrated the feasibility of this platform for osmotic
energy harvesting. Finally, we tested the system for single molecule sensing,
showing that linearized bovine serum albumin (BSA) produced translocation
signals with notably long dwell times. Together, these results highlight gated
MoS2 SiN nanochannels as a promising platform for tunable nanofluidics, with
potential applications in controlled molecular transport and energy harvesting
from osmotic gradients.

Conclusion: 注入噪声是一种有效且低成本的方法来提高模拟退火硬件的性能。

Abstract: Analog Ising machines are dedicated hardware solvers designed to solve NP
hard optimization problems. However, the global optimum is often not found as
the system gets stuck in local minima. While several strategies exist to
increase the chance of escaping local minima, often these methods needs
extensive parameter tuning. In this work, we investigate the injection of large
noise as a scheme on its own and in combination with annealing to improve the
success rate and the time-to-solution (TTS) of analog Ising machines for MaxCut
problems. We demonstrate that optimizing the noise improves the TTS by several
orders and makes both approaches competitive with the state-of-the-art, such as
chaotic amplitude control. Moreover, we are able to predict a good noise value
based on the problem connectivity and coupling strength, eliminating the need
for costly parameter optimization.

### [30] [Superradiance and Quasinormal Modes of Massive Scalar Fields around Kerr Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion Theory with Perfect Fluid Dark Matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18282)
*Teparksorn Pengpan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines the dynamics of massive scalar fields around Kerr black holes in the EMDA theory, incorporating PFDM effects and dilaton parameter r2. The results show that increasing r2 enhances superradiance and results in higher damped QNM frequencies, while increasing PFDM parameter λ suppresses superradiance and leads to lower damped QNM frequencies. In combined scenarios, λ has a stronger influence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of scalar fields around black holes is important for testing quantum gravity and alternative theories of gravity. EMDA theory provides an interesting framework for studying such phenomena, and PFDM adds another layer of complexity.

Method: The study uses asymptotic matching and iterative methods to compute superradiant amplification factors and quasinormal mode frequencies. The effects of r2 and λ on these quantities are analyzed in detail.

Result: Increasing the dilaton parameter r2 enhances superradiance and increases QNM frequencies with stronger damping. Conversely, increasing the PFDM parameter λ suppresses superradiance and decreases QNM frequencies with weaker damping. When both parameters are varied, the PFDM parameter λ has a dominant effect.

Conclusion: This work deepens our understanding of Kerr black holes in the EMDA theory and highlights the stabilizing role of PFDM in such systems.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of massive scalar fields around Kerr black holes
in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory, incorporating the effects
of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), characterized by the dilaton parameter
$r_2$ and the PFDM parameter $\lambda$. These parameters modify both the
ergosphere and the effective potential experienced by the scalar field. Using
the asymptotic matching method, we compute superradiant amplification factors,
while quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies are obtained via the asymptotic
iteration method (AIM). Our results reveal contrasting effects: increasing
$r_2$ enhances superradiance and leads to higher QNM frequencies with greater
damping, whereas increasing $\lambda$ suppresses superradiance and reduces QNM
frequencies with weaker damping. In combined scenarios, the influence of
$\lambda$ is found to be dominant. These findings extend the understanding of
Kerr black holes in EMDA backgrounds and highlight the stabilizing role of PFDM
in such systems.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We recast the finite-region analysis of Einstein's equations that underpins
the ER=EPR program into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework. By
translating curvature-energy uncertainty relations into holonomy-flux
kinematics, and by identifying Planckian Einstein-Rosen throats with
single-puncture cuts through spin networks, we obtain a precise dictionary
between entanglement and quantum geometry. Within this dictionary we derive the
Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a
minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the
Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$
under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement
renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region
curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a
regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions. Finally, we
indicate observational consequences that follow from an $N$-party generalized
uncertainty relation.

Motivation: 研究具有非平凡动能项的标量场源于非线性Sigma模型及其在黑洞背景下的动力学行为，旨在探索不同Sigma模型下的自相互作用性质及其对场动力学的影响。

Method: 通过模拟SL(2,R)和O(3)Sigma模型的非线性动力学，研究了场在不同Sigma模型下的动力学行为。比较了与自由标量场的差异，并分析了不同Sigma模型下的自相互作用特性。在二黑洞系统中，通过比较相互作用与非相互作用的情况，研究了引力波相位的变化。使用数值模拟来验证结果。

Result: 在单黑洞环境中，SL(2,R)模型表现出吸引相互作用，而O(3)模型表现出排斥相互作用。在二黑洞系统中，这两种模型导致了不同类型的相位变化（正或负）的引力波，并且由于Compton波长大于二黑洞的分立，没有波诺被判斷。数值模拟表明，非线性效应抑制了波诺被判斷现象。不同模型的类型对场的动力学行为至关重要，即动能项和势的性质共同决定场的动态行为。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了不同Sigma模型下的标量场动力学在黑洞背景下的复杂性。SL(2,R)和O(3)模型的自相互作用性质不同，并影响了场的动力学行为。在二黑洞系统中，非线性效应抑制了波诺被判斷现象。这些发现对于理解非线性Sigma模型及其在引力理论中的潜在应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma
model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We
discuss the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with
interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole
spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature
of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the
accretion process, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a
self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\mathrm{O}(3)$
one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole
system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the
gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case
and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary
separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities
tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and
potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.

TL;DR: The lunar surface offers an optimal environment for detecting astrophysical gravitational waves in the millihertz to decihertz frequency band. The mission aims to attain the necessary sensitivity to study these waves by leveraging the lunar normal mode resonances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting gravitational waves in the millihertz to decihertz band is challenging on Earth due to the seismic noise, hence the motivation behind studying the quiet lunar environment as a potential alternative.

Method: The mission, known as LILA, uses the Lunar Interferometer for GW detection. Its first phase, LILA Pioneer, focuses on achieving the required sensitivity using the lunar surface's normal mode resonances. The second phase, LILA Horizon, aims to further enhance sensitivity.

Result: By utilizing lunar surface properties, LILA can detect gravitational waves in this frequency range, which has important implications for astrophysics. The mission's phases indicate a progression in sensitivity, from covering the millihertz-decihertz range to exploring the cosmological horizon.

Conclusion: This mission represents a strategic shift in gravitational wave detection, leveraging the unique properties of the Moon's surface to study astrophysical gravitational waves in a frequency range that has been challenging on Earth.

Abstract: The Earth's Moon presents a uniquely advantageous environment for detecting
astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of millihertz to
decihertz. Unlike Terrestrial GW detectors, the quiet seismic environment of
the Moon does not impede detection in this band; in fact the ground motions of
the Moon will be excited by GWs, making the Moon a resonant amplifier at low
frequencies. The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) mission aims to be
limited by thermal Brownian noise in its optics across most target frequencies.
By taking advantage of the lunar normal mode resonances, we show that the first
phase of the mission, LILA Pioneer, achieves the GW sensitivity required to
study astrophysical sources through the millihertz to decihertz range. The
advanced phase of the mission, LILA Horizon, would increase GW sensitivity to
the cosmological horizon in this band.

Conclusion: 该研究为通过量子非局部性测试screened dark energy提供了理论框架和实验方向。

Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields
driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed
via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin
pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity
(GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment
featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating
their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism
developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects
of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be
suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the
chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently
unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is
comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging,
our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through
quantum non-locality.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Extended black hole thermodynamics can arise consistently in both asymptotically AdS and flat braneworlds through varying the brane tension, resolving issues in de Sitter space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring how black hole thermodynamics extends beyond AdS spaces and addresses challenges in different spacetime geometries, particularly de Sitter.

Method: Applied the Iyer--Wald formalism in the context of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworlds by varying the brane tension, demonstrating stability and absence of ghost modes.

Result: Established that extending black hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS but also works in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension variation, providing a new framework for black hole chemistry.

Conclusion: The variability of brane tension in DGP braneworlds offers a robust method to extend black hole thermodynamics beyond AdS, enriching the study of black hole physics in diverse spacetime settings.

Abstract: Extended black hole thermodynamics, or ``black hole chemistry,'' is usually
formulated in asymptotically AdS spacetimes by promoting the cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ to a thermodynamic variable and identifying
$P=-\Lambda/8\pi$ as the pressure. This approach, however, is less physically
motivated: $\Lambda$ is a fixed coupling of the bulk action. Moreover, in de
Sitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a
global timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this
work, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\sigma$ is
varied in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically
stable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density
$T^{(\sigma)}_{\mu\nu}=-\sigma g_{\mu\nu}$, corresponding to a negative
pressure $P_\sigma=-\sigma$. On the normal branch, the brane is asymptotically
flat with a well-defined ADM mass and a single black hole horizon, thereby
avoiding the obstructions that arise in de Sitter. We demonstrate that varying
$\sigma$ produces a new work term $V_\sigma\,\delta P_\sigma$ in the first law,
with $V_\sigma$ reducing exactly to the geometric volume $4\pi r_h^3/3$ for a
static spherical black hole. The associated Smarr relation is derived, and we
show how asymptotic flatness can be maintained along the family of solutions by
co-varying the bulk cosmological constant. Our results establish that extended
black hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS spacetimes but also arises
consistently in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension,
providing a new setting for black hole chemistry.

Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the
gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter
estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for
subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the
application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient
and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior
construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions
with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher
accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks.
Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which
ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model
weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only
several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights
with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with
fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic
expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction
strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission,
paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the
next-generation GW detectors.

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole
superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital
evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and
evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable
mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using
gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions
during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that
the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the
eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an
eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based
gravitational wave detectors.

TL;DR: The paper discusses various astronomical scenarios involving massive companions perturbing the inner dynamics of binary and multiple systems. It provides analytical formulas to study the long-term evolution of Keplerian orbital elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of massive companions on the dynamics of binary and multiple systems is crucial for various astronomical scenarios, such as circumbinary exoplanets, intermediate mass black holes, and hypothetical planets like Telisto or Planet Nine.

Method: The authors developed analytical formulas to calculate the long-term rates of change of orbital elements for systems with a massive distant perturber. They applied these formulas to specific cases to create exclusion plots in parameter spaces.

Result: The analytical framework allows for a straightforward determination of orbital evolution under perturbation, aiding in the identification of scenarios involving massive companions. The exclusion plots help constrain the possible parameters for these systems.

Conclusion: This work provides a versatile tool for studying the dynamics of gravitationally bound two-body systems with external massive perturbers, offering new insights into complex astronomical phenomena.

Abstract: The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive
black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a
massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner
dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane
should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass
black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen
planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently
spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to
that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the
Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound
two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically
worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a
straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting
astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in
their parameter spaces are provided.

Conclusion: D=6、7维黑洞由于负热容量无法自动蒸发完全消失，尽管有修正项影响，但无法改变消散趋势。

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of $D$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes with
Barrow entropy. It is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the Barrow
factor revise the thermodynamic variables such as event horizon, Hawking
temperature, entropy and heat capacity. It is interesting that the larger
five-dimensional black holes exist stably and the smaller ones evaporate to
disappear owing to the nature of heat capacities amended by the coupling and
factor. The discussions exhibit that the $D$-dimensional black holes with $D=6,
7$ set free all of their energy to vanish because of the minus heat capacities
as functions of Hawking temperature although the extra term and the fractal
power bring about their revisions on the functions, but they cannot change the
heat capacity signs, so they also cannot change the fate of six- or
seven-dimensional black holes.

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了广义相对论中黑洞热力学框架，为理解引力和热力学势之间的关系提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a charged dilaton black hole arising
from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, where the dilaton couples exponentially
to the Maxwell field via a dimensionless parameter a. Treating a as a
continuous solution parameter, we extend the black hole first law to include a
term Psi^A da, where Psi^A is the thermodynamic potential conjugate to a. We
derive Psi^A explicitly through a differential analysis of the mass, charge,
and entropy, and confirm its form via an independent Hamiltonian calculation.
Additionally, by promoting a to a spacetime-dependent scalar and introducing
auxiliary gauge fields, we provide a geometric interpretation of Psi^A as a
conserved Noether charge. We further analyze the implications of treating a as
a thermodynamic variable within the extended phase space. Despite the
modification to the first law, we demonstrate that the Smarr relation remains
unaffected due to the dimensionless nature of a, highlighting the distinction
between variational and scaling symmetries. Our analysis supports the
thermodynamic relevance of coupling constants and enriches the framework of
extended black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: This work considers positive energy theorems in asymptotically, locally AdS

infinity has compact, Einstein cross-sections admitting Killing or parallel
spinors; a positive energy theorem is derived for such spacetimes in terms of
geometric data intrinsic to the cross-section. This is followed by the first
complete proofs of the BPS inequalities in (the bosonic sectors of) 4D and 5D
minimal, gauged supergravity, including with magnetic fields. The BPS
inequalities are proven for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, but also generalised
to the aforementioned class of asymptotically, locally AdS spacetimes.

asymptotically safe gravity. By computing grey-body factors with the 6th-order
WKB method and comparing them to predictions based on the quasinormal modes,
the correspondence between transmission coefficients and quasinormal spectra is
verified. Quantum corrections, parametrized by $\gamma$, are shown to suppress
both the grey-body factors and the absorption cross-section, while the

Result: 标量场质量增加导致长寿命状态（quasi-resonances）的出现。基本模式和第一个谐波共享这些状态。实部模式随谐波数增加而降低，在第二谐波以上达到零点。势能增加导致后效回声。时域演化显示出幂律尾巴和通用渐近尾巴。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，普罗卡毛发的黑洞在massive标量场背景下的准正则振荡模式和时域特征具有复杂且丰富的动态行为，对理解强引力环境下的量子场动力学有重要意义。

Abstract: We study quasinormal modes and time-domain profiles of a massive scalar field
in the background of black holes arising in Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet--Proca
gravity. The black holes in this theory possess \emph{primary Proca hair},
which modifies the effective potential and gives rise to distinctive dynamical
phenomena. Using three complementary numerical techniques -- the WKB method
with Pad\'e resummation, time-domain integration, and the Frobenius (Leaver)
method -- we obtain accurate spectra of quasinormal frequencies. Our analysis
shows that increasing the scalar-field mass leads to arbitrarily long-lived
states, known as quasi-resonances, a behavior shared by both the fundamental
mode and the first overtone. The real part of the quasinormal mode decreases
for the first and higher overtones and starting from the second overtone it
reaches zero at some critical value of mass of the field. When the effective
potential develops an additional peak, the late-time signal exhibits a sequence
of echoes. Furthermore, the time-domain evolution reveals distinct regimes of
intermediate power-law tails $\sim t^{-4/3-\ell}\sin(A(\mu)t)$ and a universal
asymptotic tails $\sim t^{-5/6}\sin(\mu t)$.

Conclusion: 这种新的理论框架不仅适用于理论分析，还能很好地解释观测数据，是一次成功的探索。

Abstract: We consider the impact of the first string corrections of minimally coupled
single scalar field theory on inflationary dynamics. Specifically we consider
separately the string corrections $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)c_2\,\left(
\partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ and $\sim \alpha'c \square \phi
\partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$, where $\alpha'$ is the square of the
string scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the
sense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll
approximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\sim \alpha'\xi(\phi)
c_2\left( \partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial
non-minimal coupling function $\xi(\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework
emerged from the theory with correction term $\sim \alpha' c \square \phi
\partial_{\mu}\phi \partial^{\mu}\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be
worked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily
be fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar
spectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio.

Abstract: The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in
both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The
effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore
this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in
the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of
such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as
a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution,
changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including
entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about
the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the
system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of discrete Painlevé equations over finite fields is important in finite field arithmetic geometry and has applications in cryptography and coding theory.

Method: The authors analyze the orbits of the equation modulo prime powers and study the number of points on the resulting curves using algebraic geometry methods.

Result: The number of points on these curves over finite fields satisfies the Hasse-Weil bound, and the curves are shown to have genus ≤1. This is surprising compared to the situation over the complex numbers, where solutions are believed to be more transcendental.

Conclusion: The results demonstrate that discrete Painlevé equations over finite fields have a rich geometric structure and provide a bridge between integrable systems and finite field arithmetic geometry.

Abstract: We consider the orbits of a discrete Painlev\'e equation over finite fields
and show that the number of points in such orbits satisfy the Hasse bound. The
orbits turn out to lie on algebraic curves, whose defining polynomials are
given explicitly. Moreover, these curves are shown to have genus less than or
equal to one, which contrasts sharply with the case of discrete Painlev\'e
equations over $\mathbb{C}$, whose generic solutions are believed to be more
transcendental than elliptic functions.

Abstract: Boltzmann introduced the microcanonical ensemble in
  1868, \cite{Bo868-a}, and immediately attempted to give an
  example of a system whose stationary states would be described
  by the emsemble (as suggested also by his ergodic
  hypothesis). The example, \cite{Bo868-b}, has been recently
  shown to be incorrect, if taken literally: the point was to
  suppose that constants of motion, if any besides the energy,
  would necessarily be smooth functions; and soon later he warned
  on the dangers implicit in a similar assumption. Fifty years
  later Fermi wrote a paper attempting to prove that in general a
  nonlinear system should be ergodic, \cite{Fe923}: but his proof
  relied again on Boltzmann's assumption. Thirty-four more years
  elapsed, and Fermi returned on the problem collaborating with
  Pasta, Ulam, Tsingou: the surprise was that the considered non
  linear chain was apparently not following the ergodic
  hypothesis. In the same year Kolmogorov had proved the
  conservation of many quasi periodic motions in nonlinear
  perturbations of integrable systems, \cite{Ko954}: his theorem was
  considered, already a few years later, a possible explanation
  of the FPUT work, \cite{Fo992}. This was only the beginning of intense
  research: here a brief sketch is presented to illustrate the
  above themes and the connection with the multiscale aspects of
  the problems, and the ``Renormalization group method'' intended
  as a map $\RR$ whose iterations can be interpreted as
  successive magnifications, zooming on ever smaller regions of
  phase space in which motions develop closer and closer to the
  searched quasi periodic motion of given spectrum.

Abstract: We study Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories (EFTs) for systems with
non-Abelian internal symmetries near thermal equilibrium. We consider two
approaches that were put forward in the literature -- one using a redundant
Goldstone parameterization, the other employing an adjoint matter field -- and
demonstrate their complete equivalence by providing an explicit dictionary and
proving their equivalence at the path integral level. Critically, we extend
both formalisms to be compatible with the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger
(DKMS) symmetry to all orders in $\hbar \omega /T$, classifying all possible
invariant kernels satisfying unitarity constraints. We also establish precise
power-counting rules, clarifying the interplay between the semiclassical and
hydrodynamic expansions. Our work provides a framework for studying non-Abelian
charge transport and fluctuations to arbitrary orders in $\hbar \omega /T$.

Abstract: For two-dimensional conformal field theories driven by evolving background
space-time metrics in a closed universe, we present an operator formulation as
a driven inhomogeneous CFT. The Hamiltonian of this theory is given by a
background space-time dependent smearing of the stress tensor over the spatial
slice. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of the curved-space Weyl anomaly,
which we show is realized by the difference between Schr\"odinger and
Heisenberg picture Hamiltonians once an appropriate renormalization scheme, the
chirally split scheme, is chosen. As a result, the unitary evolution generated
by the background metric coincides with that of a Virasoro quantum circuit. To
showcase our formalism, we consider the stress tensor one-point function and
the entanglement entropy of an interval in both operator and curved-space
formulations. We find that these curved-space observables admit a state
interpretation only in the chirally split scheme. Finally, we derive the
holographic dual of the driven CFT in three-dimensional gravity, extending
previous works to arbitrary driving. The holographic dictionary reproduces the
stress tensor one-point function and the entanglement entropy in a
diffeomorphism invariant scheme.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The representation theory of de Sitter space admits partially massless (PM)
particles, but whether such particles can participate in consistent interacting
theories remains unclear. We investigate the consistency of theories containing
PM fields, particularly when these fields are coupled to gravity. Our strategy
exploits the fact that PM fields correspond to partially conserved currents on
the spacetime boundary, which generate symmetries. These symmetries place
stringent constraints on correlation functions of charged operators, allowing
us to test the consistency of a proposed bulk spectrum. When the assumed
operator content violates these constraints, the corresponding bulk theory is
ruled out. Applying this framework, we show that, in four-dimensional de Sitter
space, PM fields of spin 2 or 3 (at depth 0) cannot couple consistently to
gravity: such couplings necessitate additional massive fields, which are
inevitably non-unitary. In higher dimensions, however, the constraints can be
satisfied without violating unitarity if further PM fields are included. The
resulting structure leads to additional charge conservation laws, which
suggests that consistency may ultimately require an infinite tower of
higher-spin PM fields, akin to the situation for ordinary higher-spin
symmetries. The methods developed here provide powerful constraints on possible
long-range interactions in de Sitter space and delineate the landscape of
consistent quantum field theories in cosmological spacetimes.

Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical
phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality
classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of
extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$
can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly,
there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and
$p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for
correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct,
we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and
$d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies
and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the
literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including
perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising
magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the
four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.

TL;DR:  motivations for investigating crosscap states in two-dimensional rational conformal field theories, especially focusing on non-invertible symmetries.  The paper argues for the existence of crosscap states labeled by eachVerlinde line in the RCFT, expanding upon previous constructions involving simple currents. Evidence for these new states is provided by developing a generalized Cardy condition that incorporates both crosscaps and topological defects, and this is tested through specific examples. The paper also touches upon how these crosscap states behave under Verlinde lines' actions and their connections to parity and internal symmetries anomalies.    


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores crosscap states in two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs), with a particular emphasis on non-invertible symmetries. The motivation stems from the desire to extend previous work on crosscap states, which were typically associated with simple currents, to include Verlinde lines, thereby broadening the understanding of these states in RCFTs. Additionally, the paper seeks to provide evidence for the existence of these new states through the development of a generalized Cardy condition that accounts for both crosscaps and topological defects. The exploration of anomalies between parity and internal symmetries further underscores the paper's aim to comprehensively analyze the role and behavior of crosscap states in these theories.

Method: The paper employs a theoretical approach, focusing on the algebraic structure of RCFTs and the properties of Verlinde lines. It utilizes the concept of generalized Cardy conditions, which are equations that describe the fusion of boundary states in conformal field theories. By incorporating both crosscaps and topological defects into these conditions, the authors derive equations that provide insight into the existence and properties of the new crosscap states labeled by Verlinde lines. The authors validate their findings by applying these generalized conditions in specific, concrete examples of RCFTs. Additionally, the paper discusses the transformation properties of these states under the action of Verlinde lines, employing group theory and representation theory to analyze these behaviors. The exploration of anomalies between parity and internal symmetries also involves techniques from algebraic topology and group cohomology to identify and classify these anomalies.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates the existence of crosscap states labeled by eachVerlinde line in RCFTs, extending the previous framework that relied on simple currents alone. By introducing a generalized Cardy condition that accounts for both crosscaps and topological defects, the authors provide a robust theoretical foundation for the existence of these new states. Through specific examples, the paper validates the generalized Cardy condition, thereby supporting the existence of these states in particular RCFT scenarios. Furthermore, the paper elucidates the behavior of these crosscap states under the action of Verlinde lines, highlighting their transformation properties and their relationships with parity and internal symmetries anomalies. This work significantly advances the understanding of crosscap states in RCFTs and opens new avenues for exploring their applications and implications in theoretical physics.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: We investigate crosscap states in two-dimensional rational conformal field
theories (RCFTs), with an emphasis on the role of non-invertible symmetries. In
particular, we argue for the existence of crosscap states labelled by each
Verlinde line in the RCFT, extending previous constructions involving simple
currents. Evidence for the existence of these new states is obtained by
deriving a generalized Cardy condition incorporating both crosscaps and
topological defects, which we check in some concrete examples. Finally, we
briefly discuss how these crosscap states transform under the action of
Verlinde lines, as well as the connection to mixed anomalies between parity and
internal symmetries.

Abstract: For non-compact, locally symmetric moduli spaces M, the set of geodesics and
the geometry of the boundary can be completely characterised using group
theory. In particular, geodesics that asymptote to a given infinite distance
boundary point are characterised by a choice of rational parabolic subgroup
P(Q) of the local isometry group G and an element of the Cartan subalgebra of
P(Q). Under the assumption that M satisfies the "compactifiability" constraint
of arXiv:2412.03640 and some mild conditions on the spectrum of states, we use
this formalism to prove the Swampland Distance Conjecture for essentially all
locally symmetric spaces M. We show that the states necessarily transform in
some representation of G, and further that the convex hull encoding the
exponential rate at which the leading tower of states becomes light is simply
the convex hull of the weights of the representation. In a companion paper, we
then use the formalism to classify all locally symmetric spaces and irreducible
representations that are consistent with the Emergent String Conjecture.

Abstract: We relate the stability of knot invariants under twisting a pair of strands
to the stability of symmetric quivers under unlinking (or linking) operation.
Starting from the HOMFLY-PT skein relations, we confirm the stable growth of
$Sym^r$-coloured HOMFLY-PT polynomials under the addition of a~full twist to
the knot. On the other hand, we show that symmetric quivers exhibit analogous
stable growth under unlinking or linking of the quiver augmented with the extra
node; in some cases this augmented quiver captures the spectrum of motivic
Donaldson-Thomas invariants of all quivers in the sequence. Combining these two
versions of the stable growth, we conjecture that performing a~full twist on
any knot corresponds to appropriate unlinking or linking of the corresponding
augmented quiver -- this statement is an important step towards a~direct
definition of the knot-quiver correspondence based on the knot diagram. We
confirm the conjecture for all twist knots, $(2,2p+1)$ torus knots, and all
pretzel knots up to 15 crossings with an~odd number of twists in each twist
region.

Conclusion: 论文通过高维理论和膜的开放闭合性深入探讨了axion的质量生成问题，提出了关于M理论中axion和二维规范场对偶性的新见解。

Abstract: Scalar fields with masses protected by global shift symmetries, commonly
referred to as axions, are abundantly used in effective field theories in
cosmology and particle physics. However, global symmetries cannot be expected
to be protected at the fundamental level. Finding consistent ultra-violet
completions for axions is therefore a necessity. In this work, we identify the
axion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The
shift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth
dimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in
the fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction
generates a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the
literature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge
field. In a second step, we uplift this (4+1)-dimensional model to M-theory,
where the same three-form is found to couple to the membrane with a
(2+1)-dimensional worldvolume. In particular, our proposal also elucidates the
duality between the axion and a two-form gauge field in the literature. We show
that this dual two-form couples to the boundary of an open membrane in
M-theory. Finally, we comment on the relations to and differences from other
closed and open string axion monodromy models.

### [60] [The GINN framework: a stochastic QED correspondence for stability and chaos in deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18948)
*Rodrigo Carmo Terin*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach is developed to map deep neural networks (DNNs) onto quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1) symmetry. Neural activations and weights are modeled as fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling covariant gauge fixing. The gauge parameter is associated with kernel design choices in wide DNNs, and stability thresholds are linked to gauge-dependent amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections in QED. Numerical simulations of multilayer perceptrons validate theoretical predictions, and a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) is proposed using magnitude-phase parameterization of weights. A double-copy replica approach unifies the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stochastic field-theoretic approaches applied to deep学习 have emerged as a promising avenue to develop synthetic learning machines. By mapping neural networks to well-understood physical systems like QED, researchers can leverage established techniques from quantum field theory to analyze and optimize neural architectures. This paper represents a significant step in that direction by establishing a direct analogy between wide neural networks and gauge theories with local symmetries. The proposed framework is paired with practical implementation ideas, such as constructing gauge-invariant neural networks, which offer a pathway for applying quantum-inspired methods in machine learning practice. This work should serve as a bridge between theoretical physics and machine learning, providing a rich conceptual framework for future developments in both fields.

Method: The approach taken in this paper involves several key components. First, neural activations and weights are modeled as fermionic matter and gauge fields, respectively. This mapping allows the application of quantum electrodynamics (QED) principles to analyze and design neural networks. The inclusion of a fictitious Langevin time introduces stochasticity, enabling covariant gauge fixing and, consequently, the exploration of various gauge parameter settings. The gauge parameter is connected to kernel design choices in wide neural networks, highlighting the importance of gauge symmetry in network architecture. Finite-width fluctuations, which correspond to loop corrections in QED, are used to model the behavior of neural networks of finite width. The theoretical framework is validated through numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons. Additionally, the paper introduces a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) using a magnitude-phase parameterization of weights, ensuring invariance under gauge transformations, a critical property for maintaining the consistency of the mapping. Finally, a double-copy replica approach is employed to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in both stochastic QED and wide DNNs, offering a novel method for analyzing the stability and training dynamics of neural networks.

Result: The key results of this paper are as follows: 1), A mapping is established between deep neural networks and QED with local U(1) symmetry, providing a new theoretical framework for analyzing neural Networks. 2), The relationship between gauge parameters and kernel design choices in wide neural networks is clearly defined, which provides insights into the design of network architectures. 3), Finite-width fluctuations in neural networks are successfully linked to loop corrections in QED, which is a significant step toward understanding finite-width effects in deep learning. 4), The theoretical framework is validated through numerical Simulations using standard multilayer perceptrons, which adds credibility to the approach. 5), The proposal of a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) using magnitude-phase parameterization of weights offers a practical implementation strategy for applying the theoretical framework in real-world machine learning applications. 6), The double-copy replica approach successfully unifies the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in stochastic QED and wide DNNs, providing a novel method for analyzing the stability and training dynamics of neural networks. Overall, this work bridges the gap between theoretical physics and deep learning, offering both theoretical insights and practical applications, making it a significant contribution to the field.

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the theoretical understanding of deep neural networks by establishing a direct correspondence with quantum electrodynamics. By modeling neural activations and weights as fermionic matter and gauge fields, the authors create a new paradigm for analyzing and designing neural networks. The successful validation of the theoretical framework through numerical Simulations of multilayer perceptrons highlights the feasibility and potential impact of this approach. The introduction of a gauge-invariant neural network architecture further reinforces the practical relevance of the work. Additionally, the development of a double-copy replica method for unifying computations in stochastic QED and wide DNNs provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of neural Networks. This work opens new directions for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of theoretical physics and machine learning, potentially leading to advancements in both fields.

Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps
deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1)
symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by
fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling
covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel
design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent
amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections
in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through
numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel,
propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using
magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica
approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in
stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Abstract: We develop a resurgence analysis for large central charge (large $C$)
expansions in two-dimensional CFTs using the Coulomb gas formalism. Through the
exact Borel-Laplace representations of the conformal blocks $I_1(C,z)$ and
$I_2(C,z)$ associated with the four-point correlation function $ \langle
\phi_{2,1}(0)\phi_{2,1}(z,\bar{z})\phi_{2,1}(1)\phi_{2,1}(\infty)\rangle$, we
demonstrate that $I_1(C,z)$ participates in the Stokes phenomenon of $I_2(C,z)$
(and vice versa), and establish that monodromy in $z$ arises from alien
calculus in the Borel plane variable $\zeta$ (Borel dual to $C$). From a given
conformal block, resurgence theory thus enables us to discover other internal
operators (conformal blocks). This approach establishes a non-perturbative
connection between conformal blocks, shedding light on the resurgence phenomena
in more general quantum field theories.

Abstract: Free quotients of Calabi-Yau manifolds play an important role in string
compactification. In this paper, we explore machine learning techniques, such
as fully connected neural networks and multi-head attention (MHA) models, as a
potential approach to detect $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ free quotients of CICYs. When tested on unseen
examples, both models successfully identified almost all free quotients for
$\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and
$\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. These results demonstrate that
well-trained machine learning models can effectively generalize to new
Calabi-Yau manifolds and may aid in the broader classification of free
quotients in the future.

Motivation: 研究物理系统中两点函数的行为是理解量子系统动力学和复杂性的重要课题。

Method: 使用了递归方法研究了两点函数，并将其与 Toda 深度和克罗夫 bootstrap 方法相结合来分析 Lanczos 系数的温度依赖性。

Result: 通过分析发现，在低温下，Krylov 复杂度和两点函数的行为表现出良好的可解析性，并且当温度接近二维系统时，Lanczos 系数出现振荡行为。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的方法来研究量子系统中的两点函数行为，并提出了 Krylov bootstrap 方法，该方法在低温下能够控制 Krylov 复杂度和两点函数的行为。

Abstract: We consider the recursion method applied to a generic 2pt function of a
quantum system and show, in full generality, that the temperature dependence of
the corresponding Lanczos coefficients is governed by integrable dynamics.
After an appropriate change of variables, Lanczos coefficients with even and
odd indices are described by two independent Toda chains, related at the level
of the initial conditions. Consistency of the resulting equations can be used
to show that certain scale-invariant models necessarily have a degenerate
spectrum. We dub this self-consistency-based approach the ''Krylov bootstrap''.
The known analytic behavior of the Toda chain at late times translates into
analytic control over the 2pt function and Krylov complexity at very low
temperatures. We also discuss the behavior of Lanczos coefficients when the
temperature is low but not much smaller than the spectral gap, and elucidate
the origin of the staggering behavior of Lanczos coefficients in this regime.

Method: 构造超引力作用在特定空间中的边界项，并使用TsT变换生成其他背景；计算Brown-Yorke压力张量和在壳作用量；利用$Tar T$变形的特性来解释结果。

Result: 定义了在反德西特和线性微分背景中的有限边界项，显示在壳作用量产生与$B$场化学势相关的自由能；通过TsT变换，得到多种线性微分背景，并特别一致性特征，该类背景和$Tar T$变形相关；展示了在壳作用量与双变形的共形场论相符。

Conclusion: 提供了一种在精确计算中处理这类边界项的新方法，联系TsT变换和$Tar T$变形，提供了新视角研究共形场论的边界状态和热力学。

Abstract: We propose boundary terms for the action of the NS sector of supergravity on
$M_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ spacetimes -- where $M_3$ is an AdS$_3$ or a linear
dilaton background -- that render the Brown-York stress tensor and the on-shell
action finite. For AdS$_3$ backgrounds, we show that the on-shell action yields
a free energy with chemical potentials determined by the $B$-field. TsT
(T-duality + shift + T-duality) transformations of these backgrounds generate
classes of linear dilaton backgrounds distinguished by their boundary
conditions. Among them, there is one class of backgrounds that reproduces
features of the single-trace $T\bar T$ deformation. These backgrounds have
additional chemical potentials that can be turned off by large gauge
transformations of the $B$-field. We show that the Brown-York stress tensor of
these backgrounds reproduces the energies and the trace flow equation of $T\bar
T$-deformed CFTs. We also show that the on-shell action matches the $T\bar T$
partition function and discuss the interpretation of these results.

### [65] [Time-Symmetric Action-at-a-Distance Electrodynamics and the Principle of Action and Reaction for Particles at Relative Rest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18428)
*Calin Galeriu*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic or gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric charges, rest masses, position four-vectors, and four-velocities of two particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher derivatives. The author aims to prove that the principle of action and reaction is obeyed due to symmetry operations in flat conformal space. The paper involves complex mathematical derivations and symmetry arguments, but the main takeaway is that this theory provides a novel framework for understanding four-forces without four-acceleration dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to explore an alternative theory of four-forces that does not rely on four-acceleration, potentially offering a new perspective on electrodynamic or gravitational interactions.

Method: The author uses mathematical derivations involving conformal space, four-velocities, and symmetry operations to construct and validate the theory. They assume a positive spacetime interval, perform conformal inversion and improper reflection, and analyze the resulting four-forces in the limit of a null interval.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates that the four-forces satisfy the principle of action and reaction through symmetry operations, implying a time-symmetric framework without four-acceleration dependence.

Conclusion: This theory provides a novel approach to understanding four-forces, potentially challenging existing frameworks in electrodynamics and gravitation.

Abstract: We investigate a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic
or gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric
charges, the rest masses, the position four-vectors, and the four-velocities of
the two interacting particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher
derivatives. The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is
obeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal
segments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced
four-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude
but opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this
result as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start
by assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting
particles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a
hypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time
coordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection
across the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles
recover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper
coordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting
positive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null
spacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal
segments. When the two interacting particles are at rest, or move with the same
velocity, the initial and the final physical parameters that determine the
four-forces are identical. Due to symmetry, the principle of action and
reaction emerges. We make the conjecture that another, undetermined yet,
symmetry operation must also apply, in order for the principle of action and
reaction to hold even for particles moving with different velocities.

Abstract: We introduce the paradigm of destructive many-body interference between
quantum trajectories as a means to systematically generate prethermal
kinetically constrained dynamics in Floquet systems driven at special
frequencies. Depending on the processes that are suppressed by interference,
the constraint may or may not be associated with an emergent global
conservation; the latter kind having no mechanism of generation in
time-independent settings. As an example, we construct an one-dimensional
interacting spin model exhibiting strong Hilbert space fragmentation with and
without dipole moment conservation, depending on the drive frequency. By
probing the spatiotemporal profile of the out-of-time-ordered correlator, we
show that this model, in particular, has initial states in which quantum
information can be spatially localized - a useful feature in the field of
quantum technologies. Our paradigm unifies various types of Hilbert space
fragmentation that can be realized in driven systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores higher-dimensional analogues of chirally stabilized non-Fermi-liquid fixed points and their implications for symmetry-breaking behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding non-Fermi liquids in higher dimensions is a significant challenge in condensed matter physics. This paper aims to address this by constructing finite-N analogues of chirally stabilized fixed points in arbitrary dimensions up to four.

Method: The authors employ a Wilsonian operator-product-expansion renormalization group (RG) scheme to analyze the flow of quantum field theories in higher dimensions. Specifically, they identify conformal windows at finite N and investigate how symmetry-breaking masses affect these windows.

Result: The study reveals that symmetry-breaking masses are non-trivial and can collapse the conformal window, leading the system to strong coupling and resulting in dynamical mass generation. This finding establishes a new framework for understanding phase transitions in strongly coupled quantum systems.

Conclusion: The work provides a comprehensive understanding of conformal windows in higher-dimensional non-Fermi liquids and reveals the role of symmetry-breaking masses in triggering dynamical mass generation, offering new insights into the phase diagram of strongly coupled quantum systems.

Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids in $d>2$ remain poorly understood, particularly when
relevant perturbations destabilize them. In one spatial dimension, chirally
stabilized fixed points provide a rare class of analytically tractable
non-Fermi-liquid critical points, but their higher-dimensional analogues have
been elusive. Here, we develop a Wilsonian operator-product-expansion
renormalization group scheme that captures power-divergent terms and use it to
construct finite-$N$ higher-dimensional analogues of chirally stabilized fixed
points in arbitrary dimension $d\le4$. This exposes a conformal window at
finite $N$. We further show that symmetry-breaking masses, far from being
trivial, can collapse this window and drive the system to strong coupling,
triggering dynamical mass generation.

Abstract: We develop a minimal Landau theory for the concomitant intersite
charge-transfer, antiferromagnetic, and isostructural phase transitions in
ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ perovskites (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb). The model
incorporates the difference in average ligand-hole occupancy between Cu and Fe,
the staggered magnetization of the Fe sublattice, volume strain, and intrinsic
thermal expansion, together with their couplings. It qualitatively reproduces
key thermodynamic properties of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, including the
staggered magnetization, lattice volume, magnetic susceptibility, and the
nearly linear temperature-pressure phase boundary. The framework predicts a
pronounced elastic softening near the phase boundary, consistent with
experiments where the bulk modulus of the low-pressure, charge-transferred
antiferromagnetic phase exceeds that of the high-pressure, non-transferred
paramagnetic phase. It also yields pressure-driven isothermal entropy changes,
revealing that the intrinsic thermal expansion of the high- and low-temperature
phases significantly shapes the overall barocaloric response. These results
contrast with previous analyses of NdCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, where thermal
expansion was neglected in the entropy construction, and call for a
reevaluation of barocaloric effects in quadruple perovskites.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the magnetic and transport properties of GdZnPO, a material claimed to host a spin liquid. The authors report significant low-temperature thermal conductivity, a characteristic feature of topological spin liquids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of interest in the potential of materials like GdZnPO as spin liquids, along with the need to better understand their topological properties through experimental characterization, drives this work.

Method: High-quality GdZnPO single crystals were grown, characterized via transport measurements including thermal conductivity and specific heat, and magnetic properties.

Result: 1. GdZnPO exhibits giant low-temperature thermal conductivity, proportional to $	o$0K, with $	o$0 and $	o_1$ positive constants. 2. Thermal Hall effect observed, indicative of topological nature. 3. Thermal conductivity mimics magnetic specific heat, suggesting mobile low-energy spin excitations. Furthermore, the results align with theoretical models for spin liquids.

Conclusion: This study provides important experimental evidence for the thermal and transport properties characteristic of GdZnPO's potential spin liquid state, supporting further theoretical and experimental exploration into its topological properties.

Abstract: The frustrated insulating magnet can stabilize a spiral spin liquid, arising
from cooperative fluctuations among a subextensively degenerate manifold of
spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous
contour or surface in reciprocal space. The atomic-mixing-free honeycomb
antiferromagnet GdZnPO has recently emerged as a promising spiral spin-liquid
candidate, hosting nontrivial topological excitations. Despite growing
interest, the transport and topological properties of spiral spin liquids
remain largely unexplored experimentally. Here, we report transport
measurements on high-quality, electrically insulating GdZnPO single crystals.
We observe a giant low-temperature magnetic thermal conductivity down to
$\sim$50 mK, described by $\kappa_{xx}^\mathrm{m}$ $\sim$ $\kappa_0+\kappa_1T$,
where both $\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_1$ are positive constants associated with
excitations along and off the spiral contour in reciprocal space, respectively.
This behavior parallels the magnetic specific heat, underscoring the presence
of mobile low-energy excitations intrinsic to the putative spiral spin liquid.
Furthermore, the observed positive thermal Hall effect confirms the topological
nature of at least some of these excitations. Our findings provide key insights
into the itinerant and topological properties of low-lying spin excitations in
the spiral spin-liquid candidate.

Result: 在边界存在磁性杂质时，电荷能隙以下的隧道态密度会在边界附近出现强烈的费米边奇异性，表现为幂律形式，指数由自旋子-库仑激发决定

Conclusion: 边界的磁性杂质导致了幂律型的奇异性，显示出自旋子-库仑效应的影响

Abstract: We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott
insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger
liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we
predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary,
characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in
the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these
resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law
exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.

Abstract: Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum
phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and
Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum
phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice
structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs
lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates
behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum
correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW
transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by
the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is
the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure
changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of
electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric
measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a
CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing
demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced
disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst
effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase
transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of
FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering
investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore
synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering
reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by
the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with
quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a
progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete
spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T =
0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with
intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below
$T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate,
and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We
further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow
component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component
$\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with
theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate
that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$,
lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.

Conclusion: Rhombohedral graphene serves as an ideal platform for studying and controlling correlated quantum phases, promising insights into unconventional materials and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for
exploring correlated and topological quantum phases, enabled by its
Berry-curvature-bearing flat bands. While prior work has focused on separated
conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of
rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by
flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion
through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state
confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In
addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley
state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge
neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis,
consistent with a $\Delta P \cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our
fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral
graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end, symmetry-aware pipeline that converts interacting
fermionic and quantum-spin models into annealer-ready QUBOs while preserving
low-energy physics. The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2
symmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and
k-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a
Dinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the
approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a
D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii)
finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends;
(iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED)
on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show
ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster
tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study
quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error
reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising
benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and
Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates
portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for
mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity,

Abstract: Photonic topological insulators and self-induced nonreciprocity based on
nonlinear effects in asymmetric structures have garnered increased attention
due to their potential applications in quantum information technologies and
advanced photonic integrated circuits. In this study, we combine these two
fields and present asymmetric photonic crystal designs based on all-dielectric
checkerboard structures forming topological interfaces. The resulting
topological photonic structures lead to the emergence of a narrowband leaky
mode in their linear transmission response accompanied by an edge state with
topological protection. The incorporation of the nonlinear optical Kerr effect
in the system results to spectral tunability and transmission nonreciprocity in
the induced topological edge states as the input beam intensity is increased
due to the introduction of asymmetric defects along the interface. We envision
that the findings presented in our work will lead to tunable photonic
topological insulators with nonreciprocal response that promise to provide new
avenues for the development of next-generation photonic devices and quantum
optical technologies.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the use of declarative programming, specifically 5GL, in designing imaging systems, using the 96-Eyes project as an example. It highlights how 5GL can improve transparency, traceability, and reduce misalignment in multi-disciplinary teams by formalizing requirements into machine-readable problem statements. The paper also reflects on the challenges of adopting declarative programming in teams primarily using imperative languages like 3GL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to explore how declarative programming can facilitate innovation in multi-disciplinary research and product development, particularly in settings where concurrent research workflows are becoming more common.

Method: The paper uses the 96-Eyes project as a case study to demonstrate the application of 5GL in a real-world scenario. It discusses the formalization of project requirements into machine-readable problem statements and evaluates the impact on design traceability, cost reduction, and collaboration across different teams. Additionally, it reflects on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where imperative languages are still prevalent.

Result: The paper presents a framework for using declarative programming (5GL) in the design of imaging systems. It shows that this approach can enhance collaboration, improve project requirements formalization, and lead to more efficient and effective system design by preserving mission-critical inputs from diverse stakeholders. The case study with the 96-Eyes project illustrates the practical benefits of this approach in a high-throughput drug discovery context.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that declarative programming, particularly 5GL, offers a powerful tool for addressing the complexities of multi-disciplinary imaging system design. It emphasizes the importance of considering programming paradigms when designing research workflows and highlights the potential of declarative approaches to foster innovation in concurrent research environments.

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

TL;DR: Terahertz amplification and lasing in biased $n$-doped Te are possible through trigonal symmetry, with polarization selectivity and tunable ellipticity. Chiral media with DC fields can support efficient, bulk lasing at low fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve terahertz amplification and lasing for potential new devices using materials like Tellurium as active media.

Method: The method involves applying DC electric fields to $n$-doped Tellurium under trigonal symmetry. Analysis of mode polarization (RHC vs LHC circular and elliptical) and cavity resonance with Fabry-Perot etalons.

Result: Terahertz gain achieved for RHC modes under bias along c-axis; elliptically polarized eigenmodes with tunable ellipticity; lasing possible in Fabry-Perot cavities under certain bias conditions.

Conclusion: Bulk chiral Tellurium with DC fields can create polarization-selective, tunable gain media for efficient terahertz lasers, paving new device applications.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Berry curvature dipole in $n$-doped Tellurium as a
mechanism for achieving terahertz amplification and lasing by applying a DC
electric field. When the electrical bias and wave vector are aligned along the
trigonal $c$-axis, the right-handed circularly polarized mode experiences
amplification at relatively low bias, while the left-handed mode is attenuated.
Furthermore, when the electrical bias and wave vector are orthogonal to the
$c$-axis, the structure supports elliptically polarized eigenmodes that also
exhibit gain under suitable bias conditions, where the degree of ellipticity is
tunable by the applied bias. We also investigate lasing conditions for a
Fabry-Perot cavity incorporating biased Te as an active medium. Due to the
resonance in the dielectric permittivity of Tellurium, there are discrete
lasing intervals. Our results show that bulk chiral Tellurium could be used as
an electrically tunable, polarization-selective gain medium for
micrometer-scale terahertz lasers, with lasing achievable at bias fields below
the material's breakdown threshold, paving the way towards new terahertz
devices.

Abstract: We investigated ultrafast nonlinear optical effects in nitrogen-vacancy

change caused by optical Kerr effect and two-photon absorption was enhanced
several times because of the electric field enhancement induced by the

enhancement due to the PSP was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically.

Abstract: As 6G and beyond aim for sustainable, high-capacity wireless connectivity,
optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a compelling
solution.Recent advances in vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)
arrays have significantly enhanced OWC performance, enabling high-speed,
low-power data transmission. However, dense VCSEL deployments introduce
challenges related to interference and energy efficiency (EE). This paper
proposes a scalable precoding framework for EE maximization in fully
cooperative VCSEL-based OWC broadcast systems. We formulate a non-convex
optimization problem to design the precoding matrix under practical optical
constraints while guaranteeing minimum user rates. To solve this, we apply
Dinkelbach's method to handle the fractional objective and the inner
approximation technique to iteratively convexify and solve the problem.
Simulation results show that our approach consistently outperforms regularized
zero-forcing in terms of EE, particularly in large-scale deployments,
demonstrating its potential for next-generation sustainable dense OWC networks.

surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in intrinsic silicon chiral metasurfaces. We
find that the $g_\mathrm{PL}$ associated with the quasi-BIC mode remains robust
against variations in emission angle and dye thickness owing to its strong
lateral field confinement. In contrast, the $g_\mathrm{PL}$ of the SLR mode
exhibits sign inversion depending on the emission energy and dye layer
thickness. The experimental results are supported by mode decomposition
analysis, helicity density analysis, and near-field spatial distribution of the
electric field. These findings illustrate the relevance of the emitter's layer
thickness in optimizing the emission of circularly polarized light. They also
elaborate on the robustness of chiral quasi-BICs, offering insights into chiral
light-matter interactions and advancing the design of circularly polarized
light-emitting devices.

Abstract: High-precision triaxial acceleration detection holds critical applications in
seismic wave detection, geological resource exploration, and aerospace systems.
Fabry-Perot (FP) optical sensors have gained widespread adoption in these
domains due to their compact footprint and immunity to electromagnetic
interference. Nevertheless, conventional three-axis measurements predominantly
rely on assembling multiple single-axis transducers, introducing limitations
such as increased device volume and misalignment errors. In this paper, we
demonstrate a MEMS based monolithically integrated triaxial optical
accelerometer that integrates a compact size with minimal noise and low
crosstalk. The triaxial sensing structure employs a shared proof mass,
achieving significant miniaturization compared to conventional multi-chip
assembled triaxial optical accelerometers. In-plane sensing is realized through
folded spring beams, while out-of-plane detection utilizes U-shaped suspension
beams with widened central segments to suppress cross-axis sensitivity and
enhance mechanical responsivity. Experimental results demonstrate that an
operational bandwidth of 1\sim35 Hz, a minimum detectable acceleration of 4.12
ng/\sqrt{Hz}, and crosstalk below 0.023\%. The compact sensor footprint
measures 16 mm \times 16 mm \times 0.5 mm. This optical accelerometer achieves
nano-g resolution in the three-axis direction, demonstrating strong potential
for applications in seismic wave detection and other precision vibration
monitoring fields.

Abstract: Photon-pair sources based on spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in
integrated photonics are often spectrally static. We demonstrate and model a
fundamental thermo-optical mechanism that modulates photon-pair generation in
amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin films and metasurfaces via SFWM.
Femtosecond-pulsed excitation yields g2(0) higher than 400 in unpatterned a-Si,
confirming high-purity nonclassical emission. Resonant a-Si metasurfaces
produce photon pairs at rates exceeding 3.8 kHz under 0.6 mW pump power through
Mie-type modes. Pump absorption induces localized heating that redshifts
resonances, altering modal overlap and SFWM efficiency, leading to deviations
from the quadratic power scaling expected in the undepleted regime. Coupled
electromagnetic and heat-transfer simulations quantitatively reproduce these
trends. Polarization-resolved measurements show nearly isotropic nonlinear
responses, with 3 times higher third-order susceptibility of a-Si compared to
poly-Si. This work positions a-Si as a bright, CMOS-compatible quantum
photonics platform and identifies thermo-optical detuning as a key mechanism
that should be considered-and potentially harnessed-in integrated photon-pair
sources.

Result: 新模型 AMBER ff19SB-OPC 在预测 IDP 和有序多肽序列时表现出色。

Conclusion: 该研究开发了广义的 force field 并成功应用于多肽系统，扩展了其适用范围。

Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play a significant role in
intracellular phenomena and are known to exist in an ensemble of
inter-converting conformations in solution. Accurately modeling the
conformations of IDPs in solution poses a challenge to traditional force fields
that are tuned to predict the properties of folded proteins. There is a need
for generalized atomistic force fields that can accurately predict the
properties of both folded proteins and IDPs. Improvements to protein force
fields for increased accuracy in secondary structure prediction and new water
models with increased water-water dispersion interactions have been proposed in
search of a generalized simulation method. Validating the proposed improvements
against experiments poses challenges such as a lack of suitable systems to test
the generalizability and choosing a property of interest to match the
simulation results against experiments. In this work, we use small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) data from peptide-based polyampholytes that mimic IDPs to
test the generalizability of the AMBER protein force fields and the OPC water
model. The specific improvements due to the AMBER ff19SB protein force field
and the OPC water model are isolated and studied. Analysis of SAXS profiles and
the conformational distribution of polyampholyte sequences show the AMBER
ff19SB-OPC water combination to be a generalized model that predicts both
ordered polyampholyte sequences and disordered polyampholyte sequences in good
agreement with experiments. We have developed a new scattering model termed
SWAXS-AMDE that accounts for the hydration layer density changes in atomic
detail and is particularly useful in making one-to-one comparisons of simulated
scattering profiles to experiments. SWAXS-AMDE allows for the thermal
fluctuations of the solute which is particularly consequential for IDPs.

Abstract: We present a unified framework called Quantum Neural Ordinary and Partial
Differential Equations (QNODEs and QNPDEs) that brings the continuous-time
formalism of classical neural ODEs/PDEs into quantum machine learning and
quantum control. We define QNODEs as the evolution of finite-dimensional
quantum systems, and QNPDEs as infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable)
counterparts, governed by generalised Schrodinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics
with unitary evolution, coupled with a corresponding loss function. Notably,
this formalism permits gradient estimation using an adjoint-state method,
facilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that
can be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we
present quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time
discretisation, enabling efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be
less efficient on classical devices.
  The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state
preparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the
learning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many
of these applications, we consider scenarios where the Hamiltonian has
relatively few tunable parameters, yet the corresponding classical simulation
remains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient
estimation. This continuous-time perspective can also serve as a blueprint for
designing novel quantum neural network architectures, generalising
discrete-layered models into continuous-depth models.

Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical
Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a
higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower
temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum
spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full
relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the
emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our
findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of
relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated
equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the
Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the
initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could
provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena
in open quantum systems.

Result: The results demonstrate that structured light beams can significantly enhance the threshold for optical bistability, enabling the system to operate at lower input intensities. The proposed method shows promise for achieving a Controlled-NOT gate via dynamic modulation of bistability.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper presents a novel approach to realizing optical bistability in cold atomic systems using structured light, which could pave the way for advanced quantum logic and photonic devices.

Abstract: The propagation of a probe field in an N-type four level cold atomic system
is investigated under the influence of multiple coherent fields. Coherent
control of quantum interference enables switching of the probe field between
transparency and gain regimes. Subsequent analysis focuses on how the
introduction of gain in the probe transition lowers the threshold for optical
bistability, thereby enhancing the nonlinear response of the system at reduced
input intensities. A detailed analysis of optical bistability is presented,
focusing on its threshold, stability, and switching efficiency as functions of
field strengths and detunings. Structured light beams, specifically Laguerre
Gaussian modes carrying orbital angular momentum, are employed to tailor the
bistable characteristics. The impact of Orbital angular momentum through the
topological charge and azimuthal phase is shown to significantly influence the
bistable behavior. Based on these features, a theoretical scheme is proposed to
realize a Controlled-NOT gate via dynamic modulation of bistability. These
results highlight the potential of integrating nonlinear optical effects with
structured light in cold atomic systems for implementing scalable quantum logic
and advancing photonic information processing.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful
platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such
as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential
for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental
theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems
realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only
global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators
is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and
bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical
superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with
experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment
- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex
effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware
constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body
interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics
on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key
experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position
fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration
pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal
dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming
both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new
avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the
engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of
quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

Result: Equivalent circuit model produces results comparable to input-output theory but with less time and computational resources.

Conclusion: Using equivalent circuit models is a viable alternative for designing and analyzing Josephson Parametric Amplifiers in quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum-limited amplifiers, such as Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric
Amplifiers (JTWPAs) and Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), are essential
components in quantum computers. They amplify low-power microwave signals from
qubits at the 10 mK stage before further amplification at the 4 K stage using
HEMT amplifiers. In JPAs, parametric amplification is based on the nonlinear
properties of Josephson Junctions. While JPAs are typically designed and
analyzed using input-output theory based on quantum physics, we propose an
alternative approach based on an equivalent circuit model of JPAs, implemented
using open-source Josephson circuit simulators. We compare the results with
those obtained from input-output theory. This method enables the use of circuit
optimizers for various objective functions and significantly reduces design
time compared to quantum theory-based approaches.

Abstract: Quantum compilation requires the development of new algorithms that optimise
the cost of implementing quantum computations on physical hardware. Often this
gives rise to problems which are asymptotically hard to solve classically, and
for which heuristics and reductions to known problems are of great practical
use. In this paper, we study three graph-theoretic problems which can be seen
as generalisations of the Eulerian and Hamiltonian path problems. These arise
in photonic implementations of measurement-based quantum computing, where graph
states are constructed by fusing bounded-length linear resource states. Since
the fusion operation succeeds with probability smaller than one, we wish to
minimise the number of fusions required to build a particular graph state and
this corresponds to finding a minimal path or trail cover of the graph. We show
that these covering problems are NP-hard in most cases and give heuristic
algorithms for finding trail covers in graphs including a reduction to the
travelling salesman problem. We propose new rewrite strategies for graph states
that reduce the number of fusions required to build a given graph. Finally, we
apply these algorithms to the compilation of photonic fusion networks and
provide a series of benchmarks showing the performance of our algorithms on
common error-correcting codes and circuits from the QASMBench set.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a critical derivation of the high-temperature quantum Markovian
master equation (HTME), examining its foundational assumptions, their
quantum-mechanical implications, and its range of validity. Starting from the
Born-Markov master equation, and combining the spin Hamiltonian eigenoperator
formalism with a linear expansion in statistical coefficients, as the only
assumption, we obtain a quantum dissipator that generalizes the
Abragam-Redfield-Hubbard inhomogeneous master equation (ARH-IME). Our
derivation naturally incorporates an additional term for non-thermal,
high-order initial states, while reducing to ARH-IME for spin states evolving
near thermal equilibrium (weak-order). Through an alternative operator-based
derivation of the HTME, we confirm these results and reveal a symmetrization
condition for the spectral densities in the linear thermal regime. We
rigorously analyze the internal consistency of both approaches and compare them
with prior literature. To illustrate these findings, we study: (i) A canonical
spin-1/2 system interacting with a bosonic bath, demonstrating first-principles
symmetrization of spectral densities at high temperatures. (ii) Singlet-triplet
conversion in a correlated two-spin system, where the ARH-IME fails, exposing
the limitations of the weak-order hypothesis in strongly correlated regimes.
Our results challenge the traditional boundaries of NMR spin-lattice relaxation
theory and provide a refined framework for modeling open quantum systems beyond
weak order.

Conclusion: State-o-gram provides a novel solution for visualizing quantum states with arbitrary qubits, addressing the scalability limitations of previous tools while maintaining intuitive representation of probability amplitudes and phase angles.

Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly gaining popularity, necessitating intuitive

Abstract: Entanglement is a key feature in many quantum technologies, including secure
communication protocols and quantum computing. However, detecting it in mixed
quantum states remains a challenging task. While the PPT and realignment
criteria are well-established tools for entanglement detection in general, and
are especially effective in Bell-diagonal states, their connection to the
underlying group structure of this state family has not been fully explored. In
this work, we analyze the PPT and realignment criteria for Bell-diagonal states
from a group-theoretic point of view. Our results demonstrate that the group
structure of Bell-diagonal states provides a clear framework for analyzing and
computing these two entanglement detection criteria. This unified perspective
offers new insights into the mathematical and physical properties of
entanglement in structured quantum systems, like the connection of the PPT
criterion to experimentally accessible entanglement witnesses, thus opening a
path for extending the group formalism to more complex quantum systems.

TL;DR: Vectorized Quantum Block Encoding enables embedding classical data into Hilbert space, offering a pathway for Quantum Transformers (QT) to replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit simulations for improved efficiency. Current QTs are vulnerable to QPU noise, but the proposed Vectorized Quantum Transformer (VQT) addresses this by supporting ideal masked attention matrix computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via a vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, resulting in shot-efficient and gradient-free quantum circuit simulation (QCS) as well as reduced classical sampling overhead. The paper also demonstrates competitive performance compared to IBM and IonQ in quantum circuit simulation and benchmarking natural language processing tasks on IBM's state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. This noise-intermediate-scale quantum-friendly VQT approach enables a novel architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.

Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into
Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum
Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit
simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized
quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus
hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized
Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix
computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via
vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free
quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In
addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum
circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language
processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our
noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel
architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.

TL;DR: 研究发现，监测非相互作用费米子的纠缠动力学可以通过增大系统尺寸来解决已知文献中的矛盾，尤其是在一维和二维中使用GPU技术达到了更大的尺寸，证实了测量引起相变的存在并预测了相关临界参数。

Motivation: 理解量子系统中测量引起的相变对量子信息和材料科学具有重要意义。

Method: 利用GPU技术和非线性σ模型，对一维和二维系统进行了数值模拟，达到较大的系统尺寸。

Result: 一维系统需要尺寸约为10000才能排除相变，二维系统观察到相变，测不准参数和临界指数相近但与预测不一致。

Conclusion: 研究为量子系统中的监测相变提供了一个定量描述框架。

Abstract: The description of the entanglement dynamics of monitored non-interacting
fermions, including the existence of measurement-induced phase transitions
(MIPT), is a challenging problem with conflicting results in the literature.
The mapping of the problem onto a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) indicates that
relatively large lattice sizes are required to determine the nature of the
entanglement entropy (EE) in the thermodynamics limit. Here we address this
problem numerically for monitored non-interacting fermions with $U(1)$
symmetry. The use of Graphic-Processing-Unit (GPU) techniques, even with
outdated hardware, makes possible to reach much larger lattice sizes ($L =
16384$ and $160\times160$ in one (1d) and two (2d) dimensions respectively)
than in previous studies which enables us to characterize quantitatively the
entanglement dynamics. In 1d, we show that in order to confirm the absence of a
MIPT, for both projective and homodyne measurements, predicted by the NLSM it
is necessary to reach $L \sim 10000$. In 2d, also as predicted by the NLSM, we
observe for both protocols a MIPT at finite monitoring rate characterized by a
scale invariant mutual information. The critical monitoring strength depends on
the protocol while the critical exponent $\nu \approx 1.3$ governing the
approach to the MIPT is similar in both cases. These features are not correctly
predicted by the NLSM. Our results paves the way for a fully quantitative
description of the entanglement dynamics of monitoring quantum systems.

TL;DR: The study investigates whether classical weight initialization methods can mitigate barren plateaus in quantum circuits. Results show limited benefits, suggesting further exploration is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need to improve variational quantum algorithms' performance, particularly in addressing the notorious barren plateau issue.

Method: From a theoretical standpoint, each initialization method's origin in neural networks is analyzed and adapted. Numerical experiments, including different architectures and tasks, were conducted to assess performance.

Result: Initial findings demonstrate moderate improvements in some experiments, but overall benefits are marginal. The study provides a foundation for future research in this area.

Conclusion: While classical initialization strategies show promise, their application in quantum machine learning is still in its early stages and requires further refinement.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a leading paradigm in
near-term quantum computing, yet their performance can be hindered by the
so-called barren plateau problem, where gradients vanish exponentially with
system size or circuit depth. While most existing VQA research employs simple
Gaussian or zero-initialization schemes, classical deep learning has long
benefited from sophisticated weight initialization strategies such as Xavier,
He, and orthogonal initialization to improve gradient flow and expedite
convergence. In this work, we systematically investigate whether these
classical methods can mitigate barren plateaus in quantum circuits. We first
review each initialization's theoretical grounding and outline how to adapt the
notions from neural networks to VQAs. We then conduct extensive numerical
experiments on various circuit architectures and optimization tasks. Our
findings indicate that while the initial heuristics, inspired by classical
initialization, yield moderate improvements in certain experiments, their
overall benefits remain marginal. By outlining a preliminary exploration plan
in this paper, we aim to offer the research community a broader perspective and
accessible demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose future research directions
that may be further refined by leveraging the insights gained from this work.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the design and implementation of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers, emphasizing the role of modularity and photonic interconnects. It presents novel switching schemes based on Generalized Mach-Zehnder Interferometers that are more economical and less noisy than existing alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to advance quantum computing technology for future applications, addressing scalability, modularity, and error reduction.

Method: The research utilizes photonic interconnects and Generalized Mach-Zehnder Interferometers to design decentralized switching schemes. Analysis includes cost-effectiveness and noise reduction.

Result: The proposed switching schemes offer improved functionality with reduced costs and noise, contributing to more efficient quantum computing infrastructure.

Conclusion: The findings advance modular quantum computing design, providing practical solutions for scaling up quantum systems while optimizing resource usage and reducing errors.)

Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers of the future will likely be
modular by necessity or by design. Modularity is inevitable if the substrate
cannot support the desired error-correction code due to its planar geometry or
manufacturing constraints resulting in a limited number of logical qubits per
module. Even if the computer is compact enough there may be functional
requirements to distribute the quantum computation substrate over distant
regions of varying scales. In both cases, matter-based quantum information,
such as spins, ions or neutral atoms, is the most conveniently transmitted or
mediated by photonic interconnects. To avoid long algorithm execution times and
reduce errors, each module of a universal quantum computer should be
dynamically interconnected with as many other modules as possible. This task
relies on an optical switching network providing any-to-any or sufficiently
high simultaneous connectivity. In this work we construct several novel and
decentralized switching schemes based on the properties of the Generalized
Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (GMZI) that are more economic and less noisy
compared to commonly considered alternatives while achieving the same
functionality.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate $(k_1,k_2)$-extendibility of fermionic Gaussian states, a
property central to quantum correlations and approximations of separability. We
show that these states are $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible if and only if they admit a
fermionic Gaussian extension, yielding a complete covariance-matrix
characterization and a simple semidefinite program (SDP) whose size scales
linearly with the number of modes. This provides necessary conditions for
arbitrary fermionic states and is sufficient within the Gaussian setting. Our
main result is a finite de Finetti--type theorem: we derive trace-norm bounds
between $(k_1,k_2)$-extendible fermionic Gaussian states and separable states,
improving previous exponential scaling to linear in the number of modes, with
complementary relative entropy and squashed entanglement bounds. For two modes,
upper and lower bounds match at order $1/\sqrt{k_1 k_2}$. Extendibility also
provides operational support for one of the different notions of separability
in fermionic systems. Finally, for fermionic Gaussian channels, we provide an
SDP criterion for anti-degradability and show that entanglement-breaking
channels coincide with replacement channels, implying no nontrivial
entanglement-breaking fermionic Gaussian channels exist.

Motivation: Understanding how to efficiently extract energy from quantum batteries is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and applications in energy storage.

Method: The paper investigates a cavity-based quantum battery system where a transmission line composed of coupled single-mode cavities is used for charging. The authors analyze the ergotropy of the battery under different coupling configurations and initial states.

Result: The study shows that the ergotropy (a measure of the battery's usable energy) decreases with the length of the charging line. However, by engineering the initial state of the charger and introducing spatially varying couplings, nonzero ergotropy can still be maintained even beyond a critical size.

Conclusion: The research highlights the challenges and potential solutions for scaling up quantum batteries by optimizing the structure and initial state of the system.

Abstract: We investigate the problem of work extraction from a cavity-based quantum
battery that is remotely charged via a transmission line composed of an array
of coupled single-mode cavities. For uniform coupling along the line, we show
that the ergotropy of the battery, evaluated at the point of maximum power
transfer, decreases with the length of the charging line and vanishes beyond a
critical size. By carefully engineering the initial state of the charger,
nonzero ergotropy can still be harvested even beyond this critical length. We
further examine scenarios in which the charging line is initialized in an
entangled state, as well as configurations with nonuniform, parabolically
varying coupling strengths. In the latter case, we demonstrate that high
ergotropy values can be restored, highlighting the potential of spatially
engineered interactions to enhance quantum battery performance.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to chiral discrimination using gate-based quantum
processors, addressing a key challenge in adapting conventional control
techniques using modern quantum computing. Schemes such as stimulated rapid
adiabatic passage (STIRAP) and shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAP) have shown
strong potential for enantiomer discrimination; their reliance on analog and
continuous-time control makes them incompatible with digital gate-based quantum
computing architectures. Here, we adapt these protocols for quantum computers
by discretizing their Gaussian-shaped pulses through Trotterization. We
simulate the chiral molecule 1,2-propanediol and experimentally validate this
gate-based implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Our results demonstrate that
this approach is a viable foundation for advancing chiral discrimination
protocols, preparing the way for quantum-level manipulation of molecular
chirality on accessible quantum architectures.

Conclusion: This work provides an efficient and powerful tool for simulating the real-time dynamics of open quantum systems, advancing our ability to study complex quantum phenomena.

Abstract: Faithfully simulating the dynamics of open quantum systems requires
efficiently addressing the challenge of an infinite Hilbert space. Inspired by
the shifted boson operator technique used in ground-state studies of the

validate our approach by accurately reproducing the polarization dynamics of
the sub-Ohmic SBM at a significantly reduced computational cost. For the Ohmic
SBM, we demonstrate that the time-evolved final state converges precisely to
the variational prediction at both zero and finite temperatures. Furthermore,
our method reveals a new aperiodic pseudocoherent phase in the super-Ohmic SBM
with an initially polarized bath. This work establishes an efficient and

Abstract: Quantum state transmission in spin chains is a fundamental problem within
quantum technologies. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, first introduced in
the context of polyacetylene, provides a paradigmatic example of a system
exhibiting topological and non-topological phases. We explore the transmission
of one and two excitations in anisotropic Heisenberg SSH spin chains and
analyze the relationship between topological properties and state transfer
efficiency. We examine the robustness of quantum state transmission against
static disorder in the trivial and topological regimes, exploring how
topological protection influences transmission fidelity. We also consider the
effect of dipolar interactions, introducing long-range couplings and breaking
the conservation of total magnetization. Furthermore, we employ optimal control
theory to design driving pulses for state transmission, finding substantial
differences between optimizing in the trivial and topological regimes. Our
results provide insights about the interplay between topology, disorder,
interactions, and control strategies in quantum state transfer.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR) in two configurations of a maser heat engine. KUR violations occur only in one model, and this asymmetry is due to spontaneous emission breaking structural symmetry. The study reveals that decoherence mechanisms determine whether quantum or classical bounds are upheld, with implications for designing quantum heat engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limits of quantum systems, especially in engine-like setups, is crucial for advancing quantum thermodynamics and engine design.

Method: The research involves analyzing two maser heat engine models, examining effects of spontaneous emission, and studying decoherence rates to identify KUR violations.

Result: Only one engine configuration violates the KUR, attributed to decoherence in one component and not the other.

Conclusion: Decoherence significantly influences the thermodynamic bounds of quantum systems, offering guidelines for enhancing quantum heat engine performance.

Abstract: We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off
between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a
maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This
asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural
symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics.
While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures
such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our
results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one
configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state
KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration
suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These
findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining
fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum
heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing
fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a fundamental problem in finance that aims to

returns while minimizing risk. It can be formulated as a Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, which is NP-hard. Quantum
computing offers the potential to solve such problems more efficiently than
classical methods. In this work, we employ the Variational Quantum Eigensolver

Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) as the optimizer. Our experiments
are conducted using the classical simulations on the Wuyue QuantumAI platform.
The results demonstrate that the combination of WCVaR and CMA-ES leads to
improved performance in solving the portfolio optimization problem.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Perfect state transfer (PST) through a spin chain can be theoretically
obtained via predesigned PST couplings. However, the corresponding experiment
on IBM quantum computers demonstrates low transmission success probability (SP)
due to noises. Using few qubits of their 127-qubit Eagle processors, we perform
the simulation of algorithmic PST through an XY spin chain with PST couplings
on ibm_sherbrooke and ibm_brisbane processors, alongside Qiskit simulations.
The peak SP cannot reach 1 ($\sim$0.725 peak SP for N=4). We then propose a
comprehensive noise model including Pauli errors, thermal relaxation ($T_1$)
and dephasing ($T_2$), and ZZ crosstalk. Based on the experimental parameters
provided by the IBM superconducting quantum computing platform, we perform the
Qiskit simulation with the comprehensive noise model, and find that the time
evolution of the SP is highly consistent with the experimental results. This
simulation yields a peak SP of 0.761 at $\textstyle t\approx\pi/4$, closely
matching the results on hardware. To mitigate the impact of noise, we use
rescaling techniques to correct noise-induced time shifts and SP decay,
achieving an SP improvement of 0.210 (27.60%) in simulators and 0.263 (38.23%)
on hardware, aligning hitting times closer to ideal values. Additionally,
optimal couplings designed via grid search and refined by Bayesian optimization
under the comprehensive noise model achieve an SP improvement of 0.190 (26.21%)
in simulators and 0.056 (7.72%) on hardware. Our work highlights challenges in
implementing algorithmic PST on current quantum computers, proposes a
comprehensive noise model to effectively describe the system dynamics, and
provides insights for developing noise-robust quantum communication protocols.

Abstract: The partial transpose map is a linear map widely used quantum information

partial transpose, namely $\rank(\sum^K_{j=1} A_j^T \otimes B_j)\le K \cdot
\rank(\sum^K_{j=1} A_j \otimes B_j)$, where $A_j$'s and $B_j$'s are
respectively the matrices of the same size, and $K$ is the Schmidt rank. We
explicitly construct the condition when $A_i$'s are column or row vectors, or
$2\times 2$ matrices. For the case where the Schmidt rank equals the dimension
of $A_j$, we extend the results from $2\times 2$ matrices to square matrices,
and further to rectangular matrices. In detail, we show that $\sum^K_{j=1} A_j
\otimes B_j$ is locally equivalent to an elegant block-diagonal form consisting
solely of identity and zero matrices. We also study the general case for $K=2$,
and it turns out that the key is to characterize the expression of matrices

Abstract: The emerging hard X-ray - nuclear interfaces offer unique potential
advantages over traditional optical-atomic interfaces for room-temperature,
solid-state quantum information processing, including lower background noise,
tighter focusing, and exceptionally high resonance quality. Leveraging such
interfaces, a major milestone was recently achieved with the first
implementation of nuclear quantum memory in the hard X-ray range [S. Velten et
al., Nuclear quantum memory for hard X-ray photon wave packets, Sci. Adv. 10,
eadn9825 (2024)] using the Doppler frequency comb protocol. However, this
approach relies on the synchronous mechanical motion of multiple nuclear
absorbers, posing experimental challenges for on-demand photon retrieval. We
propose an on-demand hard X-ray quantum memory based on reversing the direction
of an external magnetic field in a single stationary solid-state nuclear
absorber with sets of Zeeman sublevels. This scheme is exemplified by the
quantum storage of an 1.41-$\mu$s single photon wave packet at 6.2 keV for over

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure quantum computation for client-server protocols, especially in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, is crucial for privacy-preserving tasks.

Method: Used rotation gates $R_z(	heta)$ where $	heta$ is a dyadic angle, and analyzed blind algorithms' complexity.

Result: The new technique achieves $O(	ext{poly} 	imes 	ext{depth})$ circuit complexity with $O(	ext{poly} 	imes 	ext{depth})$ parallel rounds, more efficient than existing non-parametric methods.

Conclusion: Enables practical implementation of half-blind quantum computation for encrypted data processing.

Abstract: An efficient technique of computing on encrypted data allows a client with
limited capability to perform complex operations on a remote fault-tolerant
server without leaking anything about the input or output. Quantum computing
provides information-theoretic security to solve such a problem, and many such
techniques have been proposed under the premises of half-blind quantum
computation. However, they are dependent on a fixed non-parametric resource set
that comprises some universal combination of $H,S,T,CX, CZ$ or $CCX$ gates. In
this study, we show that recursive decryption of the parametric gate,
$R_z(\theta)$, is possible exactly when $\theta=\pm\pi/2^m$ for $m\in
\mathbb{Z^{+}}$, and approximately with arbitrary precision $\epsilon$ for
given $\theta$. We also show that a blind algorithm based on such a technique
needs at most $O(\log_2^2(\pi/\epsilon))$ computation steps and communication
rounds, while the techniques based on a non-parametric resource set require
$O(\ln^{3.97}(1/\epsilon))$ rounds. We use these results to propose a universal
scheme of half-blind quantum computation for computing on encrypted data using

Abstract: Collapse models are phenomenological models introduced to solve the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics. They modify the Schr\"odinger
equation by adding non-linear and stochastic terms, which induce the
wavefunction collapse in space. The collapse effects are negligible for
microscopic systems but become dominant in the macroscopic regime, thus also
describing coherently the quantum-to-classical transition. Collapse models make
different predictions compared to those of quantum mechanics; hence they can be
tested. Here we introduce the most relevant collapse models present in the
literature, and describe their main features. We also discuss how one can test
them in different experiments, underlying the differences with predictions of
quantum mechanics, and show how these experiments can set bounds on the
collapse parameters. We conclude with a brief summary of the colored and
dissipative generalization of such models and their experimental tests.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of fractal patterns, specifically Julia sets, in quantum computing for generating images. By leveraging quantum principles like superposition and entanglement, they demonstrate how quantum circuits can create intricate fractal patterns and propose this as a new direction in quantum generative arts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the intersection of quantum mechanics and fractal mathematics, seeking to explore novel applications of quantum computing in artistic and artistic-related fields.

Method: The authors use quantum circuits, employing principles such as superposition, randomness, and entanglement, to generate a Julia set dataset. They combine these quantum techniques with classical fractal generation methods to create their dataset patterns.

Result: The result shows that quantum computing can generate complex fractal patterns, particularly Julia sets, surpassing classical methods in complexity and efficiency. They also suggest a potential future application of quantum fractal generation in quantum art.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper presents a pioneering approach using quantum computing for fractal Julia set generation, indicating a promising new direction in quantum applications within artistic domains.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various
ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape
based on a quantum art theme.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quantum Classical Branch-and-Price (QCBP), a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm for the Vertex Coloring problem on neutral-atom
Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). QCBP embeds quantum computation within the
classical Branch-and-Price (BP) framework to address three bottlenecks in
classical BP algorithms: the computational cost of Pricing Subproblems (PSPs),
branching efficiency, and the quality of primal heuristics. It uses
quantum-assisted Column Generation (CG) based on Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms
(QAA) to sample high-quality maximum-weight independent sets (MWIS), reducing
the need to repeatedly solve NP-hard PSPs. The adapted branching strategy
leverages quantum-generated independent sets to explore fewer nodes, tighten
lower bounds, and converge faster. A classical primal heuristic rapidly builds
feasible solutions from quantum-generated sets, avoiding unnecessary quantum
calls or additional Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solves. Compared with our
prior Hybrid Column Generation (HCG) and Branch-and-Bound through maximal
Independent Set (BBQ-mIS), QCBP improves both quantum-resource utilization and
solution quality. Extensive experiments show QCBP significantly outperforms HCG
and BBQ-mIS, reaching optimality on $\approx 98\%$ of benchmark instances.
Preliminary validation on real neutral-atom hardware indicates robustness to
quantum noise and hardware constraints, supporting practical applicability and
scalability to larger graph instances. QCBP emerges as a viable hybrid method
for combinatorial optimization with promising scalability on near-term quantum
hardware.

Motivation: 探索周期性驱动偶面对称间距化格子中$	extcal{PT}$对称-breaking阈值控制的机制，尤其是在缺陷对的位置及其排列下，对称-breaking阈值的影响。

Method: 通过数学建模和详细数值模拟研究周期性驱动下的拓扑能带边态在不同频率下的行为，分析了边态参与$	extcal{PT}$对称-breaking阈值的条件，比较了偶数和奇数格子节点系统的阈值模式，进一步通过双频率驱动来维持时间反演对称性来增强阈值。

Result: 在低频驱动下，系统表现出零阶对称-breaking阈值，且与缺陷对的排列位置无关；在高频驱动下，边态参与阈值取决于缺陷对的排列位置；偶数和奇数节点系统具有其独特的阈值模式；双频率驱动可显著提高阈值。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种通过控制周期性驱动和拓扑边态来精确调节$	extcal{PT}$对称-breaking阈值的方法，展示了边态在不同驱动频率下的动态行为，以及系统尺寸对阈值模式的影响，并提出了一种通过双频率驱动来增强阈值的策略，为实现长程$	extcal{PT}$对称提供了新思路。

Abstract: We investigate the control of the parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetry
breaking threshold in a periodically driven one-dimensional dimerized lattice
with spatially symmetric gain and loss defects. We elucidate the contrasting
roles played by Floquet topological edge states in determining the
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking threshold within the high- and low-frequency
driving regimes. In the high-frequency regime, the participation of topological
edge states in $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking is contingent upon the position
of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric defect pairs, whereas in the low-frequency
regime, their participation is unconditional and independent of the defect
pairs placement, resulting in a universal zero threshold. We establish a direct
link between the symmetry-breaking threshold and how the spatial profile of the
Floquet topological edge states evolves over one driving period. We further
demonstrate that lattices with an odd number of sites exhibit unique threshold
patterns, in contrast to even-sized systems. Moreover, applying co-frequency
periodic driving to the defect pairs, which preserves time-reversal symmetry,
can significantly enhance the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-breaking threshold.

Abstract: Quantum squeezing plays a crucial role in enhancing the precision of quantum
metrology and improving the efficiency of quantum information processing
protocols. We thus propose a scheme to amplify two-mode squeezing in
nanomechanical resonators, harnessing parametric amplification and two-tone
laser controls. The red-detuned laser drives facilitate the cooling of the
nanomechanical resonators down to their ground state and allow optimal quantum
state transfer in the weak-coupling, resolved sideband regime. In particular,
the competing blue-detuned lasers in the driving pairs induce displacement
squeezing in mechanical resonators. Thus, the quantum state transfer of the
squeezing in nanomechanical resonators and the intracavity correlated photons
of the parametric amplifier significantly enhance the two-mode mechanical
squeezing. Notably, increasing the coupling strength of the red detuned laser
and the ratio of blue-to-red detuned laser dramatically amplifies the two-mode
mechanical squeezing under realistic experiment parameters of a typical
optomechanical system. Our findings reveal that the proposed cooperative
mechanism effectively enhances the level of two-mode mechanical squeezing with
a considerable improvement and demonstrates exceptional resilience to thermal
noise.

TL;DR: Group-IV vacancy centers in diamond exhibit excellent optical and spin coherence properties, making them highly promising and scalable spin qubit candidates. The ability to control the charge state through multi-color laser irradiation provides a pathway to implement spin control for these centers, which is crucial for quantum applications.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore the potential of Group-IV vacancy centers in diamond as scalable spin qubit candidates, which are essential for quantum computing and information processing. The ability to control the charge state dynamically is a key requirement for such applications, and this study provides a significant advancement in achieving that.

Method: The researchers employed multi-color laser irradiation to manipulate the charge states of the lead-vacancy centers (PbV). They observed the population dynamics of these centers under different charge states and proposed a charge cycle that could potentially lead to the neutral state of the PbV center with a spin-1 system.

Result: The key results of this study are the successful demonstration of charge state control for PbV centers through multi-color laser irradiation. They achieved tunable population manipulation of the negatively charged state from 0 to 89%, which is a significant step toward controlling the spin state dynamically. Additionally, they proposed a charge cycle that could enable a transition toward the neutral state with a spin-1 configuration, which is critical for quantum applications.

Conclusion: This study significantly advances the understanding of PbV centers in diamond by demonstrating precise charge state control, which is a crucial step toward implementing spin-based quantum qubits. The proposed charge cycle offers a promising pathway toward achieving deeper control over the spin state, paving the way for scalable quantum devices.

Abstract: Group-IV vacancy centers in diamond exhibit excellent optical and spin
coherence properties, making them highly promising and scalable spin qubit
candidates. Since only specific charge states are magneto-optically active,
control over the charge state is fundamental for quantum applications. Here, we
realize the charge state control of lead-vacancy centers (PbV) through
multi-color laser irradiation. We achieve tunable population manipulation of
the negatively charged state from 0 to 89%, paving the way for spin control of
the negatively charged PbV center. Furthermore, through analysis of charge

Abstract: The Partition Search Algorithm (PSA) and the Iterative Quantum Optimization
with an Adaptive Problem (IQOAP) framework are two existing Variational Quantum
Algorithms (VQAs) for solving the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), but both
suffer from certain limitations. In this work, we proposed the Iterative
Partition Search Algorithm (IPSA), which is a targeted synthesis and refinement
of these preceding methods. Our algorithm inherits the core idea of
``partitioning to circumvent the zero vector" from PSA and the ``iterative
lattice basis reduction" framework from IQOAP. A key feature of IPSA is the
``1-tailed search spaces", which can be viewed as a highly constrained variant
of PSA's partitioning strategy, specifically designed for optimal performance
within IQOAP's iterative structure. We supplant IQOAP's fixed iteration count
with a dynamic, stack-managed process and substitute a more expressive and
shallower circuit structure for its original ansatz. Crucially, the 1-tailed
design fundamentally ensures that every successful VQA execution yields an
effective lattice basis update, thereby eliminating the issue of ineffective
iterations in IQOAP. This evolutionary path of refinement allows IPSA to
overcome the drawbacks of its predecessors precisely. Numerical simulations on
4- to 6-dimensional SVP instances demonstrate that IPSA achieves at least a
73\% improvement in success rate for finding optimal solutions and over a 35\%
improvement in average solution quality compared with the methods above while
maintaining comparable total circuit depth.

Conclusion: 这篇论文提出了一种创新性的量子数据库方法，有效解决了传统数据库在隐私保护方面的不足，尤其是在量子计算时代。

Abstract: Quantum databases open an exciting new frontier in data management by
offering privacy guarantees that classical systems cannot match. Traditional
engines tackle user privacy, which hides the records being queried, or data
privacy, which prevents a user from learning more than she has queried. We
propose a quantum database that protects both by leveraging quantum mechanics:
when the user measures her chosen basis, the superposition collapses and the
unqueried rows become physically inaccessible. We encode relational tables as a
sequence of Quantum Random Access Codes (QRACs) over mutually unbiased bases
(MUBs), transmit a bounded number of quantum states, and let a single,
destructive measurement reconstruct only the selected tuple. This allows us to
preserve data privacy and user privacy at once without trusted hardware or
heavyweight cryptography. Moreover, we envision a novel hybrid
quantum-classical architecture ready for early deployment, which ensures
compatibility with the limitations of today's Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
devices.

Motivation: Understanding the success probability of quantum state discrimination algorithms is crucial for quantum information processing and cryptography.

Method: Adapting techniques from Barnum and Knill's average-case analysis to the worst-case scenario, comparing PGM to sequential measurement.

Result: New, strictly tighter lower bound for success probability, and in low-fidelity, success probability decreases quadratically with overlap.

Conclusion: These bounds bridge gaps in our understanding of PGM success in quantum state discrimination, particularly crucial for device verification and certification where worst-case performance is paramount.

Abstract: We derive a new lower bound on the success probability of the Pretty Good
Measurement (PGM) for worst-case quantum state discrimination among $m$ pure
states. Our bound is strictly tighter than the previously known
Gram-matrix-based bound for $m\geq 4$. The proof adapts techniques from Barnum
and Knill's analysis of the average-case PGM, applied here to the worst-case
scenario. By comparing the PGM to the sequential measurement algorithm, we
obtain a guarantee showing that, in the low-fidelity regime, the PGM's success
probability decreases quadratically with respect to the pairwise overlap,
rather than linearly as in earlier bounds.

Abstract: To enable practically useful quantum computing, we require hundreds to
thousands of logical qubits (collections of physical qubits with error
correction). Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond
few tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that
orchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing
system. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining
hardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our
work fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about
distributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application
resource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of
entanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we
develop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of
the distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical
quantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit
speeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that
distributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for
a node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher
number of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic
architectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects. Our
insights on entanglement generation rates, node sizes and architecture have the
potential to inform system designs in the coming years.

Abstract: In the Wang et al. paper "Violation of Bell inequality with unentangled
photons'' [Science Advances, 1 Aug 2025 Vol 11, Issue 31], in which a brilliant
experiment involving two interwoven frustrated down conversion processes is
reported, Bell non-classicality of the observed interference processes is
conjectured under some tacit additional assumptions.
  To clear any doubts about Bell non-classicality of the interference processes
observed by Wang et al., we give an unconditional Bell-type proof that a
modified version of the experiment indeed would reveal a violation of local
realism. The data of the Wang et al. experiment show destructive interference
which surpasses the required threshold for Bell non-classicality in the
modified version, and thus effectively constitutes a positive experimental Bell
non-classicality test employing our proposal. The essence of our method is to
abandon the usual approach in which macroscopically controlled optical phases
define the measurement settings in a Bell experiment. Instead, in our case, the
local settings are determined by switching on or off the local pumping fields
of the parametric down conversion crystals at the local measuring stations of
"Alice and Bob''.
  We also show that in a standard framework of local hidden variable theories
that do not require any additional assumptions, it is possible to construct a
local realistic model which exactly reproduces the probabilities on which the
conjecture by Wang et al. violation of local realism was based. Thus, we prove
that the tacit additional assumptions in the Bell analysis of Wang et al.
constrain the class of local realistic models refuted by the experiment. Also,
we claim that the non-classical effects in the Wang et al. experiment cannot be
ascribed to unentangled photons.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution generated by

thereby serving as a natural generalization of the Hamiltonian simulation
problem. Our method generalizes the recent
Linear-Combination-of-Hamiltonian-Simulation (LCHS) framework. In instances
where $A$ is time-independent, we provide a block-encoding of the evolution
operator $e^{-At}$ with $\mathcal{O}\big(t\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ queries to
the block-encoding oracle for $A$. We also show how the normalized evolved
state can be prepared with $\mathcal{O}(1/\|e^{-At}|{\vec{u}_0}\rangle\|)$
queries to the oracle that prepares the normalized initial state
$|{\vec{u}_0}\rangle$. These complexities are optimal in all parameters and
improve the error scaling over prior results. Furthermore, we show that any
improvement of our approach exceeding a constant factor of approximately 3 is
infeasible. For general time-dependent operators $A$, we also prove that a
uniform trapezoidal rule on our LCHS construction yields exponential
convergence, leading to simplified quantum circuits with improved gate
complexity compared to prior nonuniform-quadrature methods.

macroscopic logical-level. To provide intuition, we provide a series of
explicit examples using the derived topological interfaces. We discuss the
code's utility in the burgeoning area of quantum error-correction with an
emphasis on the interplay between logical error rates and decoding.
  We conclude by outlining how such codes' representation and design can be

Abstract: In situ polymerization of conductive polymers (CPs) represents a
transformative approach in bioelectronics, by enabling the controlled growth of
electrically active materials right at the tissue or device surface to create
seamless biotic-abiotic interfaces. Traditional CP deposition techniques often
use high anodic potentials, non-physiological electrolytes, or strong oxidants,
making them harmful to adjacent tissues. A possible solution is enzymatic
polymerization which operates under milder conditions, but it is limited by the
stability and activity window of the enzyme catalysts, low throughput, and
challenges in spatially confining polymer growth. To resolve these issues, here
we developed one-dimensional porous Au-coated Ag nanowires with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-like catalytic properties, thereby for the first time enabling
mild in situ enzyme-free polymerization of conductive polymers near neutral pH.
The enzyme-free polymerization is demonstrated both in aqueous dispersions at
pH=6 and in situ onto porous Au coated Ag nanowire based stretchable
electrodes. Following enzyme-free catalytic polymerization, the electrically
conducting polymer coating on the electrode greatly improves the impedance and
achieves an impedance of 2.6 kOhm at 1 kHz for 50x50 um large electrodes.

Abstract: Ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations constitute the gold
standard for the estimation of a broad range of equilibrium properties of a
host of interacting quantum many-body systems spanning conditions from
ultracold atoms to warm dense quantum plasmas. A key practical limitation is
given by the notorious fermion sign problem, which manifests as an exponential
computational bottleneck with respect to system size and inverse temperature.
In practice, the sign problem is particularly severe in the grandcanonical
ensemble, where the bosonic and fermionic configuration spaces differ not only
with respect to the symmetry of the thermal density matrix but, crucially, also
with respect to the particle number distribution for a given chemical potential
$\mu$ [T. Dornheim, J. Phys. A 54, 335001 (2021)]. Here, we present a simple
reweighting scheme that basically allows one to retain access to grandcanonical
expectation values at the cost of fermionic PIMC simulations in the canonical
ensemble for the largest significant particle number in the fermionic sector.
As a practical example, we consider the warm dense electron gas, which has
attracted considerable recent attention due to its relevance, e.g., for the

surfaces slippery; yet, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
Here, we identify the molecular origin behind this ubiquitous phenomenon using
macroscopic tribology and surface molecular spectroscopy. We demonstrate that
reducing friction through surfactants hinges on charge complementarity:
surfactants of opposite charge to the solid surface reduce friction even at
extreme contact pressures, whereas like-charged or neutral surfactants are
ineffective. Oppositely charged surfactants self-assemble into dense and robust
molecular brushes, creating a persistent lubrication beyond the limits of
conventional mechanisms. This charge-mediated approach offers a universal and
scalable framework for friction control across length scales without
significant surface modification.

*Zahra Karimi,Somayeh Ahmadkhani,Katharina Boguslawski,Paweł Tecmer*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The study combines the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model with pCCD-based methods to analyze the electronic structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They implement the model in PyBEST and compare pCCD with configuration-interaction methods. A generalized Coulomb parameterization is introduced, and the framework is shown to be reliable and scalable for optoelectronic properties of large π-conjugated systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of large π-conjugated systems is crucial for advancing organic electronics and related materials science applications.

Method: The approach uses the PPP model implemented in PyBEST software, combines it with pCCD-based methods, and employs a rescaled interaction prefactor for effective parameterization of the Coulomb interaction.

Result: The methodology demonstrates the reliability and scalability of pCCD-based methods with suitably parametrized PPP models for studying optoelectronic properties of PAHs.

Conclusion: The integration of local electron correlation with model Hamiltonians provides a practical and accurate framework for analyzing large π-conjugated organic systems.

Abstract: Model Hamiltonians offer a cost-effective way to capture the key physics of
large $\pi$-conjugated systems. In this work, we combine the
Pariser--Parr--Pople (PPP) model Hamiltonian with pair Coupled Cluster Doubles
(pCCD)-based methods to study the ground- and excited-state electronic
structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The model Hamiltonian
implementation is done in the open-source PyBEST software package, where
numerous pCCD-type models are available. We investigate canonical Hartree--Fock
and natural pCCD-optimized orbitals to compute ground- and excited-state
properties using pCCD and its linear response extension. Their performance is
compared with configuration-interaction-based methods. Finally, we introduce a
generalized parameterization of the long-range Coulomb interaction using a
rescaled interaction prefactor to adopt the PPP parameters to the pCCD approach
and the localized nature of the pCCD orbitals. Our results demonstrate that
pCCD-based methods, combined with a suitably parametrized PPP model, provide a
reliable and scalable framework for studying the optoelectronic properties of
large $\pi$-extended systems relevant to organic electronics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction
(ADC(3)) approach for calculating double ionization potentials (DIPs). By
employing the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian in
combination with a Cholesky decomposition (CD) representation of two-electron
integrals and the frozen natural spinor (FNS) framework for virtual space
truncation, we achieve a significant reduction in both memory requirements and
computational cost. The DIPs obtained using the X2CAMF Hamiltonian show
excellent agreement with results from fully relativistic four-component
calculations. We have validated the accuracy of our implementation through
comparisons with available experimental and theoretical data for inert gas
atoms and diatomic species. The effect of higher-order relativistic corrections
is also explored.

Conclusion: MACE4IR通过其普适性、准确性及效率，为复杂系统中的红外光谱预测提供了强大的工具，特别是在化学、生物和材料科学领域。

Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have shown significant promise
in predicting infrared spectra with high fidelity. However, the absence of
general-purpose MLIPs capable of handling a wide range of elements and their
combinations has limited their broader applicability. In this work, we
introduce MACE4IR, a machine learning foundation model built on the MACE
architecture and trained on 10 million geometries and corresponding
density-functional theory (DFT) energies, forces and dipole moments from the
QCML dataset. The training data encompasses approximately 80 elements and a
diverse set of molecules, including organic compounds, inorganic species, and
metal complexes. MACE4IR accurately predicts energies, forces, dipole moments,
and infrared spectra at significantly reduced computational cost compared to
DFT. By combining generality, accuracy, and efficiency, MACE4IR opens the door
to rapid and reliable infrared spectra prediction for complex systems across
chemistry, biology, and materials science.

*Andreas Erbs Hillers-Bendtsen,Todd J. Martínez*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A tensor hypercontraction-based implementation for self-consistent field calculations with O(N^2) scaling accelerates computations by reducing redundant calculations, achieving high accuracy even for large systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate computational methods in quantum chemistry drives this research, especially for handling large biological molecules.

Method: Tensor hypercontraction is used to devise an O(N^2) scaling Fock matrix construction, eliminating redundant two-electron integral recalculations.

Result: Implementation achieves errors below 7.0e-3 Hartree for relative energies on protein systems with up to 3000 basis functions.

Conclusion: This method significantly enhances computational efficiency for large basis sets, with applications in studying protein systems.

Abstract: With the widespread use of self-consistent field methods, including
Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, the implications of accelerating
these methods are immense. To this end, we develop a tensor hypercontraction
construction with $O(N^3)$ formal scaling that can accelerate self-consistent
field calculations. Using tensor hypercontraction, we implement an empirically
$O(N^2)$ scaling Fock matrix construction that is 2-4$\times$ faster than
existing integral-direct methods, as it avoids the repeated recalculation of
two-electron repulsion integrals. In combination with a density-difference
ansatz, our tensor hypercontraction self-consistent field implementation tests
show errors below $7.0 x 10^{-3} E_h$ for relative energies on protein systems
containing up to 3000 basis functions.
