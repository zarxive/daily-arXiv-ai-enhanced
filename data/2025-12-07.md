### [1] [Dissipative Yao-Lee Spin-Orbital Model: Exact Solvability and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry Breaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04155)
*Zihao Qi,Yuan Xue*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose an exactly solvable model for studying dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems. By mapping quantum dynamics to an non-Hermitian fermionic system and exploiting strong symmetries, we construct a physically feasible spin liquid with an exceptional ring of states and transient dynamics exhibiting coexistence with Liouvillian exceptional points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dissipative quantum systems is a major challenge in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. Exactly solvable models provide a powerful tool for unraveling fundamental principles and designing practical applications.

Method: We adopt a fermionic second quantization approach to map the dissipative model into a non-Hermitian fermionic system. By exploiting strong symmetries, we determine exact eigenmodes, construct the phase diagram, and identify key dynamical features such as an exceptional ring phase and transitions between oscillatory and decaying dynamics.

Result: The model features an exceptional ring phase in momentum space, supporting an exponentially large number of non-equilibrium steady states. This phase is accompanied by new Liouvillian spectral singularities and transitions, opening a route for controlling and manipulating pulsed dissipative dynamics.

Conclusion: We provide a paradigmatic framework linking dissipative spin liquids to Liouvillian spectral singularities, showing the relevance of non-Hermitian topological states in platforms amenable to near-term quantum technologies.

Abstract: Exactly solvable dissipative models provide an analytical tool for studying the relaxation dynamics in open quantum systems. In this work, we study an exactly solvable model based on an anisotropic variant of the Yao-Lee spin-orbital model, with dissipation acting in the spin sector. We map Liouvillian dynamics to fermions hopping in a doubled Hilbert space under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and demonstrate the model's exact solvability. We analyze the model's strong and weak symmetries, which protect an exponentially large manifold of non-equilibrium steady states, establishing the system as a physically feasible dissipative spin liquid. Furthermore, we analyze the transient dynamics in a translationally invariant sector and discover that the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum hosts an exceptional ring in momentum space. We map out a characteristic $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking transition driven by the dissipation strength, which governs the crossover from oscillatory to decaying relaxation of physical observables. Our work provides a physically motivated, solvable setting for exploring the coexistence of dissipative spin liquid physics and Liouvillian spectral singularities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc.

### [3] [Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04637)
*Yu-Xin Chao,Peiyun Ge,Zhen-Xing Hua,Chen Jia,Xiao Wang,Xinhui Liang,Zongpei Yue,Rong Lu,Meng Khoon Tey,Xiao Wang,Li You*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the decay of false vacuum and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring, highlighting the exponential decrease in decay rate with symmetry-breaking field strength and deviations from metastable states, with potential applications in higher-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the behavior of false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a controlled quantum system, potentially providing insights into fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and condensed matter physics.

Method: The researchers used a Rydberg atom ring with long-range van-der-Waals interactions to explore properties beyond the standard Ising model, enabling the study of many-body tunneling and metastability.

Result: The decay rate of the false vacuum decreases exponentially with increasing symmetry-breaking field strength, aligning with theoretical predictions. Small deviations from the metastable state lead to deviations from the expected scaling law.

Conclusion: The findings support the theoretical framework of false vacuum decay and offer a new platform for studying many-body tunneling in non-trivial geometries and energy spectra.

Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.

### [4] [Minimizing the Number of Code Switching Operations in Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04170)
*Erik Weilandt,Tom Peham,Robert Wille*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: It is possible to minimize the number of code switches needed for a quantum circuit by modeling the problem as a minimum-cut instance on a graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing faces the challenge of managing errors, and code switching is a proposed solution, but it comes with significant overhead. This paper aims to optimize this process.

Method: The authors model the problem of minimizing code switches as a minimum-cut problem on a graph derived from the circuit.

Result: The study shows that their approach can efficiently solve this problem in polynomial time.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel method for optimizing code-switching-based quantum computations by transforming the problem into a graph minimum-cut issue, achieving an automated solution that can include additional factors like reducing idle periods or gate depth.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computers rely on Quantum Error-Correcting Codes (QECCs) to protect information from noise. However, no single error-correcting code supports a fully transversal and therefore fault-tolerant implementation of all gates required for universal quantum computation. Code switching addresses this limitation by moving quantum information between different codes that, together, support a universal gate set. Unfortunately, each switch is costly-adding time and space overhead and increasing the logical error rate. Minimizing the number of switching operations is, therefore, essential for quantum computations using code switching. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the number of code switches required to run a given quantum circuit. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently in polynomial time by reducing it to a minimum-cut instance on a graph derived from the circuit. Our formulation is flexible and can incorporate additional considerations, such as reducing depth overhead by preferring switches during idle periods or biasing the compilation to favor one code over another. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated approach for compiling and optimizing code-switching-based quantum computations at the logical level.

### [5] [A Quantum Gate Architecture via Teleportation and Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04171)

Conclusion: QGATE架构展示了在光子量子计算中的潜力，特别是在减少错误率方面。

Abstract: We present a universal quantum computing architecture which combines the measurement-driven aspect of MBQC with the circuit model's algorithm dependent generation of qubit entanglement. Our architecture, which we call QGATE, is tailored for discrete-variable photonic quantum computers with deterministic photon sources capable of generating 1D entangled photonic states. QGATE achieves universal quantum computing on a logical data qubit register via the implementation of Clifford operations, QGATE ancilla, and arbitrary angle single-qubit measurements. We realise unitary evolutions defined by multi-qubit Pauli strings via the generation of entanglement between a sub-set of logical qubits and a mutual QGATE ancilla qubit. Measurement of the QGATE ancilla in the appropriate basis then implements a given term of the desired unitary operation. This enables QGATE to both directly perform Hamiltonian evolutions in terms of a series of multi-qubit Pauli operators, in terms of projectors for an arbitrary sparse Hamiltonian, or realise multi-controlled gates enabling direct translation of circuit models to QGATE. We consider examples inspired by quantum chemistry and computational fluid dynamics. We propose an example photonic implementation of QGATE and calculate thresholds of $10.36\pm0.02\%$ or $25.98\pm0.28\%$ on the photonic loss for logical qubits constructed from foliated rotated surface codes, dependent on the deployment of intra-layer or inter-layer fusion respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The task of conclusive exclusion for a set of quantum states is to find a measurement such that for each state in the set, there is an outcome that allows one to conclude with certainty that the state in question was not prepared. Defining classicality of statistics as realizability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model, we show that there is a quantum-over-classical advantage for how well one can achieve conclusive exclusion. This is achieved in an experimental scenario motivated by the construction appearing in the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph theorem. We derive noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities bounding the conclusiveness of exclusion, and describe a quantum violation of these. Finally, we show that this bound also constitutes a classical causal compatibility inequality within the bilocality scenario, and that its violation in quantum theory yields a novel possibilistic proof of a quantum-classical gap in that scenario.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for simulating heterogeneous quantum networks using SeQUeNCe, addressing challenges like diverse platforms, photon wavelengths, and clock rate mismatches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous quantum networks are complex and costly to build, so simulations are needed to optimize their design and operation.

Method: The authors developed a discrete-event simulator, SeQUeNCe, and integrated models for Ytterbium atoms and superconducting qubits. They also implemented protocols for time-bin encoded photons, accounting for clock rate differences and noise.

Result: The simulations revealed key trade-offs between performance and fidelity in heterogeneous systems, identifying bottlenecks such as quantum frequency conversion losses and clock synchronization issues.

Conclusion: This framework provides a tool for evaluating and improving the scalability and reliability of future quantum networks, emphasizing the importance of simulation in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Quantum networks are expected to be heterogeneous systems, combining distinct qubit platforms, photon wavelengths, and device timescales to achieve scalable, multiuser connectivity. Building and iterating on such systems is costly and slow, motivating hardware-faithful simulations to explore architecture design space and justify implementation decisions. This paper presents a framework for simulating heterogeneous quantum networks based on SeQUeNCe, a discrete-event simulator of quantum networks. We introduce faithful device models for two representative platforms - Ytterbium atoms and superconducting qubits. On top of these models, we implement entanglement generation and entanglement swapping protocols for time-bin encoded photons that account for disparate clock rates and quantum frequency conversion and transducer losses/noise brought by the heterogeneity. Using extensive simulations, we map the rate-fidelity trade space and identify the dominant bottlenecks unique to heterogeneous systems. The models are open source and extensible, enabling reproducible evaluation of future heterogeneous designs and protocols.

Abstract: Accurate computation of non-covalent, intermolecular interaction energies is important to understand various chemical phenomena, and quantum computers are anticipated to accelerate it. Although the state-of-the-art quantum computers are still noisy and intermediate-scale ones, development of theoretical frameworks those are expected to work on a fault-tolerant quantum computer is an urgent issue. In this work, we explore resource-efficient implementation of the quantum phase estimation-based complete active space configuration interaction (QPE-CASCI) calculations, with the aid of the second-order Møller--Plesset perturbation theory (MP2)-based active space selection with Boys localized orbitals. We performed numerical simulations of QPE for the supramolecular approach-based intermolecular interaction energy calculations of the hydrogen-bonded water dimer, using 6 system and 6 ancilla qubits. With the aid of algorithmic error mitigation, the QPE-CASCI simulations achieved interaction energy predictions with an error of 0.02 kcal mol$^{-1}$ relative to the CASCI result, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology. Preliminary results on quantum circuit compression for QPE are also presented to reduce the number of two-qubit gates and depth.

Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation remains essential for developing and validating quantum algorithms, especially as current quantum hardware is limited in scale and quality. However, the growing diversity of simulation methods and software tools creates a high barrier to selecting the most suitable backend for a given circuit. We introduce Maestro, a unified interface for quantum circuit simulation that integrates multiple simulation paradigms - state vector, MPS, tensor network, stabilizer, GPU-accelerated, and p-block methods - under a single API. Maestro includes a predictive runtime model that automatically selects the optimal simulator based on circuit structure and available hardware, and applies backend-specific optimizations such as multiprocessing, GPU execution, and improved sampling. Benchmarks across heterogeneous workloads demonstrate that Maestro outperforms individual simulators in both single-circuit and large batched settings, particularly in high-performance computing environments. Maestro provides a scalable, extensible platform for quantum algorithm research, hybrid quantum-classical workflows, and emerging distributed quantum computing architectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is an algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation that has been of broad interest for application with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, SQD does not always converge on a practical timescale. Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations.

Conclusion: 量子相干性可以通过局部操作显著增强，并且发现了在某些情况下这种增强可以无限放大，同时得出了关于局部相干性上限和全局相关性不能转化为局部相干性的基本限制

Abstract: Unspeakable coherence is a key feature separating quantum and classical physics. Modelled as asymmetry with respect to a continuous transformation generated by a physically relevant observable, such as the Hamiltonian or angular moment, unspeakable coherence has been shown to be the relevant notion of coherence for achieving quantum advantage in the tasks of metrology, reference frame alignment and work extraction, among others. A question of both practical and foundational value is: Given some copies of a state with low coherence, can we prepare a more coherent state via coherence non-increasing operations? Here, we study this question in the minimal limiting case: Given two uncorrelated copies of a coherent state, can one, via globally coherence non-increasing unitaries, increase the coherence in a subsystem? We fully solve this problem for qubits, identifying the optimal unitaries and revealing the existence of bound coherence. This is then used to create a completely constructive multi-qubit coherence enhancement protocol, where only effective-qubit unitaries are used. Unexpectedly, in this protocol, we show that there exists states for which the ratio of the input-output coherence can be amplified unboundedly. Extending beyond qubits, we derive two fundamental upper bounds on the amount of local coherence that can be increased and prove a no-go theorem showing that certain global correlations cannot be converted to local coherence.

Abstract: Temporal modes of quantum light pulses is a promising resource for modern quantum technologies, driving advancements in quantum computing, communication, and metrology. Precise control and manipulation of these modes remain critical challenges, particularly in systems where nonlinear multimode dynamics interact with dispersion effects. In this work, we focus on the role of group velocity dispersion (GVD) within optical cavities - a phenomenon traditionally viewed as detrimental but increasingly recognized as a versatile tool for quantum light manipulation. We present a perturbation-theory-based approach to analyze GVD effects in a synchronously pumped dispersive cavity. By comparing perturbative solutions to rigorous steady-state results, we establish the validity region of the perturbative approach and assess its limitations in multimode systems. Our study identifies key parameters governing the breakdown of perturbation theory, such as mode order, dispersion strength, and cavity decay rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries presents a significant challenge despite recent advancements in metastability-induced quantum batteries. This study introduces dissipation engineering as a solution to improve the efficiency and power of quantum batteries.

Method: Dynamic control strategies, including dissipation engineering, are employed to optimize the quantum battery's performance. This involves temporally separating energy storage and release, suppressing emission during charging, and enhancing output coupling during discharging.

Result: The result of this work is the demonstration of nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power, along with an improvement in work extraction efficiency by over two orders of magnitude and high power compression factors outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Dissipation engineering has been identified as an effective pathway toward achieving high-power, room-temperature coherent microwave sources using quantum batteries.

Abstract: Recently proposed metastability-induced quantum batteries have shown particular promise for coherent microwave generation. However, achieving high-power coherent microwave generation in quantum batteries remains fundamentally challenging due to quantum correlations, aging, and self-discharging processes. For the cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (CQED)-based quantum batteries, a further trade-off arises between strong spin-photon coupling for energy storage and sufficient output coupling for power delivery. To overcome these constraints, we introduce dissipation engineering as a dynamic control strategy that temporally separates energy storage and release. By suppressing emission during charging and rapidly enhancing the output coupling during discharging, we realize nanosecond microwave bursts with watt-level peak power. By optimizing three dissipation schemes, we improve work extraction efficiency of the quantum battery by over two orders of magnitude and achieve high power compression factors outperforming the state-of-the-art techniques, establishing dissipation engineering as a pathway toward room-temperature, high-power coherent microwave sources.

Conclusion: 为无解析解系统的特性研究提供了新方法。

Abstract: The variational quantum eigen solver (VQE), has been widely used to find the ground state energy of different Hamiltonians with no analytical solutions and are classically difficult to compute. In our work, we have used VQE to identify the phase transition boundary for an infinite order phase transition. We use long-range XXZ (LRXXZ) chain for our study. In order to probe infinite order phase transition, we propose to utilise the ground state energy obtained from VQE. The idea rests on the argument that VQE requires an ansatz circuit; therefore, the accuracy of the VQE will rely on this ansatz circuit. We have designed this circuit such that the estimated ground state energy is sensitive to the phase it is evaluated in. It is achieved by applying the constraint that the net spin remains constant throughout the optimisation process. Consequently, the ansatz works in a certain phase where it gives relatively small random error, as it should, when compared to the error in ground state energy calculations of the other phases, where the ansatz fails. By identifying these changes in the behaviour of the error in ground state energy using VQE, we were able to determine the phase boundaries. Using exact diagonalisation, we also compare the behaviour of the energy gradient and energy gap across both the phase transition boundaries for this model. Further, by increasing the depth of the optimisation circuit, we also accurately evaluate the ground energy of the LRXXZ chain for the value of coupling constant, J equal to -1

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate enhanced sensitivity of an atom-based Rydberg radio frequency (RF) receiver integrated with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) Luneburg-type metamaterial lens. By analyzing the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in Cesium vapor, we compare receiver performance with and without the GRIN lens under a 2.2~GHz and a 3.6~GHz far-field excitation. Our measurements reveal a significant amplification of the EIT transparency window when the lens is introduced, consistent with the theoretical prediction that the local E-field enhancement at the vapor cell reduces the minimum detectable electric field and increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the Rydberg RF receiver. This experimental validation highlights the potential of metamaterial-assisted quantum sensing to overcome the inherent bandwidth and sensitivity limitations of bare Rydberg receivers for a variety of applications, such as electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing, quantum radar, and wireless communications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The hallmark of two-dimensional chiral topological phases is the existence of anomalous gapless modes at the spatial boundary. Yet, the manifestation of this edge anomaly within the bulk ground-state wavefunction itself remains only partially understood. In this work, we introduce a family of multipartite entanglement measures that probe chirality directly from the bulk wavefunction. Our construction involves applying different permutations between replicas of the ground state wavefunction in neighboring spatial regions, creating "permutation defects" at the boundaries between these regions. We provide general arguments for the robustness of these measures and develop a field-theoretical framework to compute them systematically. While the standard topological field theory prescription misses the chiral contribution, our method correctly identifies it as the chiral conformal field theory partition function on high-genus Riemann surfaces. This feature is a consequence of the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that any regularization of the theory at the permutation defects must introduce gapless boundary modes. We numerically verify our results with both free-fermion and strongly-interacting chiral topological states and find excellent agreement. Our results enable the extraction of the chiral central charge and the Hall conductance using a finite number of wavefunction replicas, making these quantities accessible to Monte-Carlo numerical techniques and noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural Gibbs states (fNGS), a variational framework for modeling finite-temperature properties of strongly interacting fermions. fNGS starts from a reference mean-field thermofield-double state and uses neural-network transformations together with imaginary-time evolution to systematically build strong correlations. Applied to the doped Fermi-Hubbard model, a minimal lattice model capturing essential features of strong electronic correlations, fNGS accurately reproduces thermal energies over a broad range of temperatures, interaction strengths, even at large dopings, for system sizes beyond the reach of exact methods. These results demonstrate a scalable route to studying finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems beyond one dimension with neural-network representations of quantum states.

Abstract: Security of quantum key distribution (QKD) relies on certifying that observed correlations arise from genuine quantum entanglement rather than eavesdropper manipulation. Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods. We provide corrected methodology using cross-distribution calibration and recommend mandatory adversarial testing for quantum security claims.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了安全、高效的混合QKD-PQC系统，为实际网络中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum-secure communication have highlighted the value of hybrid schemes that combine Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Yet most existing hybrid designs omit realistic finite-key effects on QKD key rates and do not specify how to maintain security when both QKD and PQC primitives leak information through side-channels. These gaps limit the applicability of hybrid systems in practical, deployed networks. In this work, we advance a recently proposed hybrid QKD-PQC system by integrating tight finite-key security to the QKD primitive and improving the design for better scalability. This hybrid system employs an information-theoretically secure instruction sequence that determines the configurations of different primitives and thus ensures message confidentiality even when both the QKD and the PQC primitives are compromised. The novelty in our work lies in the implementation of the tightest finite-key security to date for the BBM92 protocol and the design improvements in the primitives of the hybrid system that ensure the processing time scales linearly with the size of secret instructions.

Abstract: This study explores the use of subspace methods in combination with counterdiabatic driving in a Rydberg atom system to solve the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Although exact counterdiabatic driving offers excellent performance, it comes at an unscalable computational cost. In this work, we demonstrate that counterdiabatic driving can be significantly improved by restricting the analysis to a relevant subspace of the system. We first show that both direct diagonalization and the Krylov method for obtaining the counterdiabatic matrix can be accelerated through the use of subspace techniques, while still maintaining strong performance. We then demonstrate that the cost function used in the standard Krylov method can be further optimized by employing a subspace-based cost function. These findings open up new possibilities for applying counterdiabatic driving in a practical and efficient manner to a variety of quantum systems.

Abstract: Although the control of non-Hermitian quantum systems has a growing interest for their nonunitary feature in the time evolution, the existing discussions are not more than two or three dimensions and heavily influenced by the singularity of the energy spectrum. We here develop a general theory to control an arbitrary number of bosonic modes governed by the time-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. It takes advantage of the gauge potential in the instantaneous frame rather than the energy spectrum of Hamiltonian. In particular, the dynamics of a general non-Hermitian continuous-variable system is analyzed in the instantaneous frame associated with time-dependent ancillary operators that are superpositions of the laboratory-frame operators and irrelevant to the original Hamiltonian. The gauge potential is determined by the unitary transformation between the time-dependent and stationary ancillary frames. The upper triangularization condition for the Hamiltonian's coefficient matrix in the stationary ancillary frame enables two of the time-dependent ancillary operators to be nonadiabatic Heisenberg passages of the non-Hermitian system. The probability conservation of the system wavefunction can be restored at the end of these passages without artificial normalization. Our theory is exemplified with the perfect and nonreciprocal state transfers in a cavity magnonic system. The former holds for arbitrary initial states and is irrelevant to the parity-time symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the exceptional point of the spectra; and the latter is consistent with the unidirectional perfect absorbtion. Our work essentially extends the universal quantum control (UQC) theory to the non-Hermitian continuous-variable systems, providing a promising approach for their coherent control.

Abstract: The emergence of huge-scale, data-intensive linear optimization (LO) problems in applications such as machine learning has driven the need for more computationally efficient interior point methods (IPMs). While conventional IPMs are polynomial-time algorithms with rapid convergence, their per-iteration cost can be prohibitively high for dense large-scale LO problems. Quantum linear system solvers have shown potential in accelerating the solution of linear systems arising in IPMs. In this work, we introduce a novel almost-exact quantum IPM, where the Newton system is constructed and solved on a quantum computer, while solution updates occur on a classical machine. Additionally, all matrix-vector products are performed on the quantum hardware. This hybrid quantum-classical framework achieves an optimal worst-case scaling of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ for fully dense LO problems. To ensure high precision, despite the limited accuracy of quantum operations, we incorporate iterative refinement techniques both within and outside the proposed IPM iterations. The proposed algorithm has a quantum complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5} κ_A \log(\frac{1}ε))$ queries to QRAM and $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \log(\frac{1}ε))$ classical arithmetic operations. Our method outperforms the worst-case complexity of prior classical and quantum IPMs, offering a significant improvement in scalability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The structural characterization of high-dimensional mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) by classifying MUBs subsets remains a major open problem. The existing methods not only fail to conclude on the exact classification, but also are severely limited by computational resources and suffer from the numerical precision problem. Here we introduce an operational approach to identify the inequivalence of MUBs subsets, which has less time complexity and entirely avoids the computational precision issues. For arbitrary MUBs subsets of $k$ elements in any prime dimension, this method yields a universal analytical upper bound for the amount of MUBs equivalence classes. By applying this method through simple iterations, we further obtain tighter classification upper bounds for any prime dimension $d\leq 37$. Crucially, the comparison of these upper bounds with existing lower bounds successfully determines the exact classification for all MUBs subsets in any dimension $d \leq 17$. We further extend this method to the case that the dimension is a power of prime number. This general and scalable framework for the classification of MUBs subsets sheds new light on related applications.

Abstract: We introduce a qudit-native framework for engineering robust discrete time crystals (DTCs) by leveraging their internal multilevel structure. Our approach confines the periodic drive to specified on-site subspaces, creating an embedded kick that suppresses heating by preventing population leakage to inactive levels. We underpin DTC stability with a normal-form analysis that decomposes the effective dynamics into distinct components: the carrier locks the subharmonic frequency, neutral terms govern the slow decay and dephasing of the subharmonic response, and charged terms scatter spectral weight away from the locked modes. This framework's predictive power is demonstrated across various qudit platforms: in spin-1 chains, we enhance the stability of DTC by confining the drive to a subspace; in spin-3/2 systems, we show that robustness is dictated by the symmetry of the subspace partition; and in spin-2 platforms, we realize concurrent 2T and 3T DTCs under a unified drive. These findings establish a systematic, hardware-efficient methodology for designing stable and multifunctional Floquet phases of matter on modern qudit-based quantum processors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the viability of HCF in phase-based QKD protocols due to their potential for longer communication distances. The application of TF-QKD in non-smooth fibres opens up new possibilities for secure communication.

Method: The study conducts two experiments: 1) concurrent measurements on 2 km HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and 2) a TF-QKD interferometer using HCF and SMF.

Result: HCF shows promise for TF-QKD and other phase-based QKD protocols, matching SMF performance.

Conclusion: HCF is a suitable material for phase-based QKD protocols, providing a cost-effective alternative to SMFs.

Abstract: The performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) is heavily dependent on the physical properties of the channel over which it is executed. Propagation losses and perturbations in the encoded photons' degrees of freedom, such as polarisation or phase, limit both the QKD range and key rate. The maintenance of phase coherence over optical fibres has lately received considerable attention as it enables QKD over long distances, e.g., through phase-based protocols like Twin-Field (TF) QKD. While optical single mode fibres (SMFs) are the current standard type of fibre, recent hollow core fibres (HCFs) could become a superior alternative in the future. Whereas the co-existence of quantum and classical signals in HCF has already been demonstrated, the phase noise resilience required for phase-based QKD protocols is yet to be established. This work explores the behaviour of HCF with respect to phase noise for the purpose of TF-QKD-like protocols. To achieve this, two experiments are performed. The first, is a set of concurrent measurements on 2 km of HCF and SMF in a double asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration. The second, uses a TF-QKD interferometer consisting of HCF and SMF channels. These initial results indicate that HCF is suitable for use in TF-QKD and other phase-based QKD protocols.

Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution has been shown to be a promising framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d.

The quantum measurement results then inform the classical optimization procedure used by the Cascaded Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE). We demonstrate the algorithm on a system of interacting electrons and show how it can be used on long-term error-corrected as well as short-term intermediate-scale quantum computers. Our simulations performed on IBM Brisbane produced energies well within chemical accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose methods to mitigate single- and two-qubit control errors due to residual exchange coupling in systems of exchange-coupled resonant singlet-triplet qubits. Commensurate driving, where the pulse length is an integer multiple of the drive period, can mitigate errors from residual intra-qubit exchange, including effects from counter rotating terms and off-axis rotations, as well as leakage errors during two-qubit operations. Residual inter-qubit exchange creates crosstalk errors that reduce single-qubit control fidelities. We show that using a single-spin coupler between two resonant singlet-triplet qubits can reduce this crosstalk error by an order of magnitude. Assuming perfect coupler state preparation and realistic charge and hyperfine noise, we predict that coupler-assisted two-qubit gate errors can be below $3\times10^{-3}$ for gate times as short as $66~\text{ns}$, even in the presence of residual exchange levels exceeding several hundred kHz. Our results suggest the potential of utilizing coupler-based architectures for large scale fault-tolerant spin qubit processors based on resonant singlet-triplet qubits.

Abstract: This work investigates Bayesian stepwise estimation (Se) for measuring the two parameters of a unitary qubit rotation. While asymptotic analysis predicts a precision advantage for SE over joint estimation (JE) in regimes where the quantum Fisher information matrix is near-singular ("sloppy" models), we demonstrate that this advantage is mitigated within a practical Bayesian framework with limited resources. We experimentally implement a SE protocol using polarisation qubits, achieving uncertainties close to the classical Van Trees bounds. However, comparing the total error to the ultimate quantum Van Trees bound for JE reveals that averaging over prior distributions erases the asymptotic SE advantage. Nevertheless, the stepwise strategy retains a significant practical benefit as it operates effectively with simple, fixed measurements, whereas saturating the JE bound typically requires complex, parameter-dependent operations.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Linear Solvers (VQLS) are a promising method for solving linear systems on near-term quantum devices. However, their performance is often limited by barren plateaus and inefficient parameter initialization, which significantly hinder trainability as the system size increases. In this work, we introduce PVLS, a learning-based parameter prediction framework that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate high-quality initial parameters for VQLS circuits. By leveraging structural information from the coefficient matrix, PVLS predicts expressive and scalable initializations that improve convergence and reduce optimization difficulty. Extensive experiments on matrix sizes ranging from 16 to 1024 show that PVLS provides up to a 2.6x speedup in optimization and requires fewer iterations while maintaining comparable solution accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of machine-learning-guided initialization strategies for improving the practicality of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in the NISQ era.

Abstract: Transmitting information about quantum states over classical noisy channels is an important problem with applications to science, computing, and sensing. This task, however, poses fundamental challenges due to the exponential scaling of state space with system size. We introduce shadow tomography-based transmission with unequal error protection (STT-UEP), a novel communication protocol that enables efficient transmission of properties of quantum states, allowing decoder-side estimation of arbitrary observables. Unlike conventional approaches requiring the transmission of a number of bits that is exponential in the number of qubits, STT-UEP achieves communication complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of observables, depending on the observable weight. The protocol exploits classical shadow tomography for measurement efficiency, and applies unequal error protection by encoding measurement bases with stronger channel codes than measurement outcomes. We provide theoretical guarantees on estimation accuracy as a function of the bit error probability of the classical channel, and validate the approach against several benchmarks via numerical results.

Result: 展示了如何利用这些方法控制原子和超导量子比特，结果取得了不错的进展。

Conclusion: 未来将探索将coherent control与 Engineered dissipation结合，仍需解决许多开放性问题。

Abstract: Quantum control refers to our ability to manipulate quantum systems. This tutorial-style chapter focuses on the use of classical electromagnetic fields to steer the system dynamics. In this approach, the quantum nature of the control stems solely from the underlying dynamics, through the exploitation of destructive and constructive interference to reach the control target. We first discuss two basic control principles -- coherent control which uses manipulation in frequency or time to design these interferences, and adiabatic following where access to the control target is enabled by tracking the time-dependent ground state. For complex control targets and system dynamics that exceed the scope of these basic principles, optimal control theory provides a powerful suite of tools to design the necessary protocols. A key consideration for the successful application of optimal control theory is a proper choice of the optimization functional. All concepts are illustrated using recent work from my research group, with a focus on controlling atoms and superconducting qubits. The chapter concludes with an outlook on integrating coherent control with engineered dissipation and a discussion of open questions in the field.

Abstract: We present a native realization of iSWAP and parameterized exchange gates for neutral atom quantum processing units. Our approach leverages strong dipole-dipole interactions between two dipole-coupled Rydberg states, and employs optimal control techniques to design time-efficient, high-fidelity gate protocols. To minimize experimental complexity, we utilize global driving terms acting identically on all atoms. We implement a noise-aware pulse selection strategy to identify candidate protocols with reduced susceptibility to certain noise sources, then analyze their performance under realistic noise sources -- including atomic motion, Rydberg decay, and experimentally motivated laser phase and intensity noise. For a $^{88}$Sr-based architecture, we demonstrate fast iSWAP gate protocols which exceed fidelities of $99.9\%$ under realistic experimental conditions. These results pave the way for expanding the neutral atom gate set beyond typical Rydberg blockade-based entangling gates.

Conclusion: QKAN-LSTM为量子启发式序列建模提供了一种有效的方法，展示了其在实际数据中的高效性。

Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a particular type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are central to sequential modeling tasks in domains such as urban telecommunication forecasting, where temporal correlations and nonlinear dependencies dominate. However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a quantum meta-learning framework using Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM) to optimize parameter initialization for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), achieving superior performance compared to classical and other quantum sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is the pressing challenge of parameter optimization in QAOA for near-term quantum processors, which directly impacts the performance and scalability of quantum algorithms.

Method: The method involves developing a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models, specifically the QK-LSTM, as learned optimizers in a 'learning to learn' paradigm. The models are tested on the Max-Cut problem, and the QK-LSTM is compared to classical LSTM and other quantum sequence models.

Result: The QK-LSTM optimizer shows superior performance, achieving the highest approximation ratios and the fastest convergence rate across tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). It demonstrates perfect parameter transferability and sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era by leveraging the compact and expressive quantum kernel architecture and QK-LSTM model.

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for solving combinatorial optimization problems on near-term quantum processors. However, finding good variational parameters remains a significant challenge due to the non-convex energy landscape, often resulting in slow convergence and poor solution quality. In this work, we propose a quantum meta-learning framework that trains advanced quantum sequence models to generate effective parameter initialization policies. We investigate four classical or quantum sequence models, including the Quantum Kernel-based Long Short-Term Memory (QK-LSTM), as learned optimizers in a "learning to learn" paradigm. Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness. The QK-LSTM, with only 43 trainable parameters, substantially outperforms the classical LSTM (56 parameters) and other quantum sequence models, establishing a robust pathway toward highly efficient parameter initialization for variational quantum algorithms in the NISQ era.

Method: 研究者通过数值模拟和理论分析的方法，使用了Lindblad动力学框架，研究由 OPEN 驱动的 Dicke 模型和开式 Kerr 模型中的相变过程。

Result: 研究结果显示，系统在被驱动过程中，非平衡熵产生量在临界状态附近表现出明确的时间尺度，并且对于 bosonic Gaussian 状态系统，熵产生量的无速度依赖性质被证实。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解开放量子系统中的普遍非平衡响应和热不可逆特性提供了理论框架和技术路径，扩展了临界现象理论的适用范围。

Abstract: We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.

TL;DR: A pump-free scheme for generating microwave-optical (M-O) Bell pairs using color centers and time-bin encoding, achieving a heralding rate of >1kHz and near-unity fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on the generation of entangled photon pairs, but conventional methods involve optical pumping which generates waste heat. This paper proposes an alternative approach to eliminate this heating problem while maintaining high-fidelity entanglement generation, which is critical for distributed quantum computing where components are separated by long distances.

Method: The paper describes a pump-free protocol utilizing color centers. It involves creating spin-photon entanglement, then converting the spin state into a microwaved photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. Microwave signals are detected using a transmon qubit. The protocol combines a spin-optical interface with this design to achieve the desired results.

Result: The proposed scheme successfully generates M-O Bell pairs at a rate exceeding 1kHz with near-perfect fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of the pump-free approach in distributed quantum computing architectures.

Conclusion: This work opens a new pathway for scalable and efficient quantum communication by eliminating the need for optical pumping in M-O entanglement generation, paving the way for future applications in quantum networks.

Abstract: Distributed quantum computing involves superconducting computation nodes operating at microwave frequencies, which are connected by long-distance transmission lines that transmit photons at optical frequencies. Quantum transduction, which coherently converts between microwave and optical (M-O) photons, is a critical component of such an architecture. Current approaches are hindered by the unavoidable problem of device heating due to the optical pump. In this work, we propose a pump-free scheme based on color centers that generates time-bin encoded M-O Bell pairs. Our scheme first creates spin-photon entanglement and then converts the spin state into a time-bin-encoded microwave photon using a strongly coupled Purcell-enhanced resonator. In our protocol, the microwave retrieval is heralded by detecting the microwave signal with a three-level transmon. We have analyzed the resulting Bell state fidelity and generation probability of this protocol. Our simulation shows that by combining a state-of-the-art spin-optical interface with our proposed strongly-coupled spin-microwave design, the pump-free scheme can generate M-O Bell pairs at a heralding rate exceeding one kilohertz with near-unity fidelity, which establishes the scheme as a promising source for M-O Bell pairs.

Abstract: We implement a decoy-state quantum key distribution scheme using a telecom C-band single-emitter source. The decoy states are created by varying the optical excitation of the quantum emitter to modulate the photon number distribution. We provide an analysis of our scheme based on existing security proofs, allowing the calculation of secret key rates including finite key effects. This enables us to demonstrate, with a realistic single-photon source, positive secret key rates using our scheme over 227 km of optical fiber, equivalent to a loss tolerance one order of magnitude greater than non-decoy schemes. This work broadens the scope of single-photon sources in future quantum networks by enabling long-distance QKD with realistic levels of single-photon purity.

Abstract: The electron flux diverts electrons from optimal hydrogen production pathways to competitive pathways, which overall reduces the efficiency of the photo fermentation hydrogen production (PFHP) system. For tackling electron flux and metabolic pathway regulation, a hybrid material (nano-capattery (NC)) was developed based on cobalt-iron-nitrogen doped biochar (Co-Fe-NBC). The NC possessed both the capacitor property (287.91 F/g) and battery-like charge storage 38.3 mC/g with the highest energy density of 159.95 mWh/g. These properties existed due to its Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co2+/Co3+ redox cycle ability, a highly porous surface (291.81 m2/g BET surface area) caused by the defects (AD/AG 3.13) and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) observed through electro paramagnetic resonance. During PFHP, there is an 85% reduction in propionic acid, a 65.3% record electron management efficiency, an improved 1.34 NAD+/NADH ratio, along with a 87% increase in dehydrogenase activity, confirming the superior role of NC in efficient regulation of the metabolic pathway and electron flux management. These exceptional properties of biochar-based NC raised the cumulative hydrogen production from 151.03 mL (control) to 589.54 mL, which was an enormous increase of 367%.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的解决方案，用于恢复气体电子衍射实验中的低动量迁移缺失数据，有助于更准确地研究分子结构。

Abstract: We report an iterative algorithm to retrieve accurate real space information from gas electron diffraction measurements with missing data at low momentum transfer. The algorithm is similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase. The difference in our case is that the goal is not retrieval of the phase of the diffraction signal but the missing data at low momentum transfer, which is necessary for generating the real-space pair distribution function. The missing data is a common problem in static and ultrafast gas phase electron diffraction experiments due to experimental constraints. We demonstrated successful restoration of the missing data in simulated data and in experimentally measured diffraction signals of static and photo-dissociated trifluoroiodomethane and iodobenzene molecules.

Conclusion: 开发的GAFF参数为Se-S含物在催化还原酶中的行为研究提供了新工具，揭示出氨基酸基团对协同催化的作用机制这一关键发现

Abstract: In the search for small organoselenium-based mimics of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme, it has been observed that selenenyl sulfides (RSeSG) derived from amine-based GPx mimics have the potential to be reduced at the catalytic site of glutathione reductase (GR), thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of these mimics in biological systems. However, molecular insights into these interactions are lacking due to the absence of force field parameters for Se-S containing compounds. In this study, we present force field parameters for selenenyl sulfides with a phenyl selenide backbone developed using the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). Employing these parameters, a 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of RSeSG was performed. The results indicate that both the amino nitrogen and its substituent significantly influence the interaction of RSeSG at the catalytic site of GR.

Abstract: Atomically precise metal nanoclusters bridge the molecular and bulk regimes, but designing bimetallic motifs with targeted stability and reactivity remains challenging. Here we combine density functional theory (DFT) and physics-grounded predictive artificial intelligence to map the configurational landscape of 13-atom icosahedral nanoclusters X$_{12}$TM, with hosts X = (Ti, Zr, Hf), and Fe and a single transition--metal dopant spanning the 3$d$-5$d$ series. Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples. At the same time, attention patterns and Shapley attributions highlight size mismatch, $d$-electron count, and coordination environment as key descriptors. All data, code, and workflows follow FAIR/TRUE principles, enabling reproducible, interpretable screening of unexplored nanocluster chemistries for catalysis and energy conversion.

Abstract: The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a key detector component for precise electron and photon measurements in electron-ion collision experiments. At the Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), high-performance calorimetry is essential for exploring the internal structure of nucleons and studying the dynamics of quarks and gluons within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper presents the optimized design and performance simulation of the EicC ECAL system. The ECAL consists of three specialized sections tailored to distinct detection environments: (1) an electron-Endcap employing high-resolution pure Cesium Iodide (pCsI) crystals, (2) a central barrel, and (3) an ion-Endcap, both adopting a cost-effective Shashlik-style sampling calorimeter with improved light yield. Each segment's geometry and material composition have been systematically optimized through Geant4 simulations to achieve excellent energy and position resolutions as well as strong electron-pion discrimination. The simulated performance indicates that the ECAL can achieve energy resolutions of 2 percent divided by sqrt(E) for pCsI crystals and 5 percent divided by sqrt(E) for Shashlik modules, meeting the design goals of the EicC detector.

Result: 实验结果表明，使用10MΩ电阻层的探测器在时分和空间分辨率上表现最佳。此外，通过电荷共享技术也可以进一步提高探测器的性能，尽管在某些区域可能会出现系统性偏移。然而，较低阻值的电阻层架构可能导致电荷分布不均匀，从而降低时分辨率。

Conclusion: 电阻层是提高PICOSEC微球探测器稳定性和可靠性的关键因素。通过优化电阻层的阻值和架构，可以在保证探测器高时分和空间分辨率的同时，提升其长期性能和适应性。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of resistive PICOSEC Micromegas detector prototypes, tested under identical conditions, constant drift gap, field configurations, and photocathode at the CERN SPS H4 beam line. This work provides a proof of concept for the use of resistive layer technology in gaseous timing detectors, demonstrating that robustness can be improved without compromising the excellent timing performance of PICOSEC Micromegas. Different resistive architectures and values were explored to optimize stability and ensure reliable long-term operation in challenging experimental environments. The prototype with a 10MΩ resistive layer achieved the best overall performance, with a timing resolution of 22.900 {\pm} 0.002 ps and a spatial resolution of 1.190 {\pm} 0.003 mm, while charge sharing across multiple pads enabled combined timing resolutions below 28 ps. A lower-resistivity (200kΩ) configuration exhibited enhanced charge spread, leading to minor systematic offsets in reconstructed pad centers, yet maintained robust timing and spatial performance. Capacitive charge-sharing architectures improved spatial resolution in some regions but suffered from signal attenuation and nonuniform charge distributions, resulting in slightly degraded timing (33.300 {\pm} 0.002 ps) and complex localization patterns. Mechanical precision, particularly readout planarity and photocathode alignment, was identified as critical for uniform detector response. These studies benchmark the potential of resistive layers for gaseous timing detectors and provide a foundation for scalable designs with optimized timing and spatial resolution across diverse experimental applications.

Abstract: A hybrid dual-readout calorimeter concept, comprising both electromagnetic and hadronic sections, has recently been proposed to meet the performance requirements of experiments at future e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ colliders. The front compartment consists of a homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeter made of high-density crystals, each coupled to a pair of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) providing the simultaneous readout of scintillation and Cherenkov light. To efficiently detect Cherenkov photons in the presence of dominant scintillation signals, an optical filter is placed in front of one of the two SiPMs to suppress photons in the wavelength region corresponding to that of scintillation emission. % In this study, PWO, BGO, and BSO crystals with different dimensions were tested to measure their scintillation light yield and decay time, as well as their transmission and emission spectra. A set of $\sim 100~\rm μm$-thick optical filters was also characterized by measuring their transmittance curves. The experimental results were used to model and estimate the expected filter performance in attenuating scintillation light for the various crystals. % The performance of each filter was experimentally validated by measuring the crystal light output with and without the filter using a $^{22}$Na radioactive source and a LYSO:Ce crystal, confirming the accuracy of the calculations. % The results show that interference filters are unsuitable for this application because their transmittance strongly depends on the photon incidence angle. Conversely, two absorptive long-pass filters with cutoff wavelengths around 590~nm were found to block more than 99\% of the scintillation light from PWO crystals, satisfying the calorimeter specifications.

Abstract: We identify a symmetry that enforces every symmetric model to have a Fermi surface. These symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are realizations of a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness. The symmetry we construct exists in quantum lattice fermion models on a $d$-dimensional Bravais lattice, and is generated by the onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry. The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\mathbf{k})\in\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\mathbf{k}\in \cal{F}}$. Furthermore, we comment on the topology of these symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces, proving they generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (i.e., open orbits).

Abstract: Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.
  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.
  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.

Abstract: We analyze a series of interacting Majorana Fermion chains with finite range pair interactions with coupling strength $g$ that all exhibit a tri-critical point that separates an Ising critical phase from a supersymmetric gapped phase. We first notice that the interacting models exhibit an even-odd asymmetry depending on the number of sites, $δ$, over which the interaction ranges. The even case exhibits competing order, thereby making it numerically untractable while the odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at $g=-0.5$ where the entanglement entropy vanishes. By introducing a swirling geometrical twist, we map our 1D $δ$-range chains to a series of 2D $δ/2$-width models. Our new 2D models possess a unique helical boundary condition, constructed from 1D chains with the end of one connected to the start of another. We propose that the phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D. That is, the $g_c-δ$ behavior is controlled by a 2D tri-critical universality class at $δ\to\infty$ limit and is predicted by finite-size scaling theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.

Abstract: We observe anomalous charge modulations induced by ionized indium impurities on the surface of the semiconductor black phosphorus by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). When the im- purities are switched into a negatively charged state by the STM tip, periodic charge modulations emerge around the impurity center, but strictly confined by the nanoscale impurity potential. These modulations form a distorted triangular pattern, whose periodicity remains unchanged in a wide range of positive bias. Furthermore, these local charge orders exhibit an anisotropy opposite to that expected based on the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, challenging a simple band-structure inter- pretation. Our experiment demonstrates the possibility of creating and manipulating macroscopic charge orders through impurity engineering.

Conclusion: 系统的压-温行为揭示了 La4Ni3O10 结构转变的结构相变及其与密度编织有序的关系。

Abstract: The crux of understanding the superconducting mechanism in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates hinges on elucidating their structural phases. Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.

*Edward H. Hellen*

Main category: nlin.CD

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complex dynamics of oscillatory systems like the Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillator is important in many fields of science and engineering, including neuroscience and electrical engineering.

Method: Bifurcation analysis was applied to the Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillator driven by a sinusoidal source using numerical methods and analog circuit measurements.

Result: A two-dimensional regime map of the parameter space of source frequency and amplitude was created, showing regions of different oscillatory behaviors, including unstable oscillations, subharmonic limit cycles, and chaos.

Conclusion: The detailed regime map provides a better understanding of the foundational Fitzhugh-Nagumo system and aids in the research of more complex implementations of this system.

Abstract: Bifurcation analysis is applied to the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator driven by a sinusoidal source. A numerically generated 2d regime map showing the variety of oscillatory dynamics in the parameter space of source frequency and amplitude agrees well with a map created from analog circuit measurements. Application of the sinusoidal source to the fast variable's first-order differential equation produces an island in the map in which oscillations at the source frequency are unstable and the behavior is dominated by two distinct families of subharmonic limit cycles and by chaos. Previously published maps are portions of the map shown here and are shown to be consistent with it. The more detailed and comprehensive regime map presented here should facilitate the understanding of this foundational system and thereby aid the ongoing research involving more complicated implementations of the Fitzhugh-Nagumo system.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the convergence dynamics of a system near period-doubling bifurcations, combining analytical derivations and numerical simulations. It derives critical exponents and validates them through numerical means, demonstrating that the system belongs to the same universality class as one-dimensional unimodal maps despite its higher dimensionality and relativistic corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of complex systems near bifurcation points is essential for predicting and controlling their dynamics. This paper aims to provide analytical insights and numerical confirmation to support the understanding of such systems.

Method: The paper employs a combination of analytical derivations and large-scale numerical simulations to investigate the convergence dynamics of the system near period-doubling bifurcations. It derives critical exponents and validates them through numerical means.

Result: The paper derives critical exponents $\alpha= 1$, $\beta= -1/2$, and $z = -2$ from the normal form near the bifurcation threshold, and shows that these exponents satisfy the homogeneous scaling relation $z = \alpha/ \beta$. It also derives an exponential relaxation law with a relaxation exponent $\delta= -1$ for $K < K_c$, and confirms the agreement between theory and simulation.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the dissipative relativistic kicked rotator shares the same universality class as one-dimensional unimodal maps despite its higher dimensionality and relativistic corrections. This finding contributes to the understanding of the universality of complex systems across different dimensions and physical frameworks.

Abstract: We investigate the convergence dynamics of this system near period-doubling bifurcations by combining analytical derivations and large-scale numerical simulations. At the bifurcation threshold ($K = K_c$), the dynamics reduce to a normal form that produces a power-law decay $d(n) \propto n^{-1/2}$, from which the critical exponents $α= 1$, $β= -1/2$, and $z = -2$ are derived. These analytical predictions are confirmed numerically and shown to satisfy the homogeneous scaling relation $z = α/ β$. Linearization of the map near the fixed point yields an exponential relaxation law $d_n = d_0 e^{-n/τ}$ for $K < K_c$, with $τ\propto (K_c - K)^{-1}$, leading to the relaxation exponent $δ= -1$. The remarkable agreement between theory and simulation demonstrates that the dissipative relativistic kicked rotator shares the same universality class as one-dimensional unimodal maps, despite its higher dimensionality and relativistic corrections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the nonlinear dynamic behavior of coupled resonator systems is crucial for advancing micro-nano electro-mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS).

Method: The authors use a systematic two-time-scale expansion method (Direct Partition of Motion) based on Blekhman's perturbation scheme to analyze the system's behavior under a high-frequency drive.

Result: The study shows that the high-frequency drive can effectively control the system's resonant response and selectively activate specific modes, enabling active tunability of the nonlinear response and energy channelization.

Conclusion: This research provides a theoretical framework and practical methodology for achieving precise control of coupled resonator systems, which is essential for developing advanced micro-scale devices.

Abstract: This article investigates how a uniform high frequency (HF) drive applied to each site of a weakly-coupled discrete nonlinear resonator array can modulate the onsite natural stiffness and damping and thereby facilitate the active tunability of the nonlinear response and the phonon dispersion relation externally. Starting from a canonical model of parametrically excited \textit{van der Pol-Duffing} chain of oscillators with nearest neighbor coupling, a systematic two-widely separated time scale expansion (\textit{Direct Partition of Motion}) has been employed, in the backdrop of Blekhman's perturbation scheme. This procedure eliminates the fast scale and yields the effective collective dynamics of the array with renormalized stiffness and damping, modified by the high-frequency drive. The resulting dispersion shift controls which normal modes enter the parametric resonance window, allowing highly selective activation of specific bulk modes through external HF tuning. The collective resonant response to the parametric excitation and mode-selection by the HF drive has been analyzed and validated by detailed numerical simulations. The results offer a straightforward, experimentally tractable route to active control of response and channelize energy through selective mode activation in MEMS/NEMS arrays and related resonator platforms.

Abstract: We study $1/12$-BPS and $1/16$-BPS cohomologies and the fortuitous mechanism in ABJM theory. We first establish the existence of fortuitous states in the $N=1$ theory, where the theory is abelian and trace relations are extreme. We then provide explicit constructions of fortuitous states at $N=2$. We find fortuitous states both at weak coupling, in direct parallel to what has been done in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, but we also find additional fortuitous states at $k=2$, which is in the strongly coupled regime. The extra fortuitous states that appear at $k=2$ are in non-trivial monopole sectors. A striking distinction from $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM is that the fortuitous states appear at much smaller quantum numbers, making them easier to find. Along the way, we formulate a non-renormalization conjecture for cohomologies in ABJM.

Abstract: We study the 'number' $\mathfrak{N}(μ)$ of AdS vacua with a UV cut off $ μ$. It has been proposed that this number is finite. We find evidence that $\mathfrak{N}(μ)\lesssim a \ μ^{-b}$ as $μ\rightarrow 0$ for some constants $a$ and $b$ of $O(1)$ in Planck units that may depend on dimension and the number of supercharges. For this result to hold it is crucial to integrate over the volume of massless and tachyonic directions of AdS which corresponds to the volume of the space of marginal and relevant deformations of the dual CFT. We are led to the surprising prediction that theories with large number of light moduli contribute very little to the volume measure among all theories. We also speculate about the dS case leading to the number of quasi-dS vacua of the order of $Λ^{-α}$ for some $O(1)$ parameter $α$.

Result: A gravitational holographic dual is successfully constructed for the self-dual sector of \( \mathcal{N}=4 \) SYM.

Conclusion: This work is a significant step toward understanding holography at zero 't Hooft coupling.

Abstract: Using twistor string theory, we engineer a gravitational holographic dual of the self-dual sector of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. This provides a top-down example of holography at zero 't Hooft coupling. Our holographic dictionary operates at the level of D-branes wrapping twistor lines and generalizes the D-instanton prescription used to compute scattering amplitudes. As an application, we study the correlators of determinant operators that act as generating functions of half-BPS operators in the self-dual theory. We show that these correlators are dual to configurations of giant gravitons in the bulk.

Result: 论文的主要结果是构建了一个规范理论的变形框架，其中对称性由Twist结构控制，同时需要引入了扭曲的微分微积分。此外，论文表明，这种变形在 планar 水平仅影响Feynman图的外部边，简化了计算并保持内部边的不变性。此外，该框架为超杨米尔斯的$	extcal N=4$的扭曲变形提供了新的例子，并据信与Yang-Baxter变形有关。

Conclusion: 总之，该论文为研究规范理论的可相变形提供了一个新的框架和方法，推动了我们对如何在量子场论中引入和处理对称性变形的理解，特别是与Yang-Baxter变形在同一背景下。这种研究不仅丰富了规范理论的数学结构，还可能对物理中的对偶性和量子效应有所帮助。

Abstract: In this paper we consider gauge theories that are relativistic and scale-invariant, and we construct their deformed versions via suitable star products. In particular, the non-commutative structure is controlled by Drinfel'd twists that are built out of symmetry generators that include the scale transformation. To achieve this, we construct a twisted differential calculus that allows us to identify the proper gauge-covariant quantities. We also show that our construction is equivalent to twists where the symmetry generators are implemented as active transformations of fields. As a consequence of our construction, the deformed gauge theories possess a twisted version of the original symmetry group. Moreover, at the planar level, the deformation is encoded just on the external legs of Feynman diagrams, leaving then the amputated diagrams undeformed. This work extends previous constructions and allows us to define twist-deformations of $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills that are conjectured to be holographically dual to a class of homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$.

Abstract: We study real-time holographic four point Wightman functions involving scalars, photons, gluons and gravitons in the Poincare patch of AdS$_4$. We show that when the momenta of the middle two operators are spacelike, four-point exchange Wightman functions factorize into a product of three-point functions. This expression coincides with a Wightman conformal partial wave corresponding to the operator dual to the exchanged particle in the bulk. Further, we discuss and explicitly show how these results can be analytically continued to obtain Euclidean AdS correlators up to contact diagrams and avoid the need to perform any nested bulk point integrals in contrast to the traditional Witten diagram approach. We then translate our results to twistor space taking first steps towards a twistor space reformulation of four point Wightman functions. For conformally coupled scalars interacting with a cubic potential, we obtain a beautiful form for four and five point functions. For the interesting case of Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity, we derive a simple double copy relation. This is easiest to see when correlators are expressed in twistor space using Schwinger parameterization where the graviton correlator is simply the square of its gluon counterpart.

Abstract: Inflation generally assumes a field with nonzero potential that leads to inflationary expansion happening at arbitrarily early times. We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.

Abstract: There is mounting evidence that entanglement dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems in the limit of large subsystems and long times is described by an entanglement membrane effective theory. In this paper, we derive the membrane description in a solvable chaotic large-$N$ model, the Brownian SYK chain. This model has a collective field description in terms of fermion bilinears connecting different folds of the multifold Schwinger-Keldysh path integral used to compute Rényi entropies. The entanglement membrane is a traveling wave solution of the saddle point equations governing these collective fields. The entanglement membrane is characterised by a velocity $v$ and a membrane tension ${\cal E}(v)$ that we calculate. We find that the membrane has finite width for $v<v_B$ (the butterfly velocity), however for $v > v_B$, the membrane splits into two wave fronts, each moving with the butterfly velocity. Our results provide a new viewpoint on the entanglement membrane and uncover new connections between quantum information dynamics and scrambling.

Abstract: We present an alternative dimensional reduction that yields an effective theory of dilatons in a two-dimensional de Sitter background. Specifically, by performing an S-wave reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein gravity, we obtain free massless dilatons in the static patch, and a dynamically evolving dilatons in the past Milne wedge. We then propose a static patch worldsheet formulation in terms of CFTs with SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) deformed Hamiltonians on the cylinder. A key feature of this construction is that a stretched horizon in the static patch, equipped with an emergent UV boundary condition, acts as a gravitating observer. Using the similar reduction, we have also obtained a Schwarzian action coupled to free massless dilatons in the near horizon near extremal limit of four dimensional charged AdS black holes. The worldsheet description for the same has been proposed and discussed in \cite{Das:2025cuq}. We also comment on how different notions of worldsheet time may themselves be \textit{emergent}.

Abstract: We construct entanglement surfaces for rotating cylindrical black holes in a double holographic setup, extending previous results to the case of stationary backgrounds. We analyze both the 5d braneworld construction as well as the embedding in 10d type IIB string theory. We couple the rotating cylindrical black hole to a non-gravitating bath, and study island and Hartman-Maldacena surfaces. Properties of island surfaces are characterized by three regimes, bounded by two critical parameters. In addition to the critical value known for the static case, we find that a new one emerges, related to the extremal limit of the rotating black hole. This behaviour is present both for the bottom-up as well as the top-down models, for which we find qualitative agreement.

Abstract: We study the effect of modular flow on correlation functions of fermions in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model coupled weakly to a bath, which we take to be another SYK model. The system and bath, together are prepared in the thermofield double (TFD) state, and we focus on the effect of modular flow generated by the reduced density matrix for the SYK system, obtained by tracing out the bath. We show, in the late time limit, that modular flowed correlators of two Majorana fermions, single-sided and two-sided, exhibit non-trivial singularities. Beyond a critical value of the modular parameter, the ``modular scrambling time", the singularity structure shows correlations being transferred from one boundary to the other. The calculations are performed by employing the replica trick in Euclidean time and appropriately analytically continuing to real time. Exploiting the connection between modular flow generators and SL$(2,{\mathbb R})$ boosts we use the microscopic picture to reconstruct the dual bulk modular flow in two-sided AdS$_2$ black hole spacetime. Fixed points of the flow allow to identify quantum extremal surfaces (QES) demarcating the entanglement wedge of the boundary system and the island. We show that bulk modular flow can move fermion insertions near the right boundary past the horizon leading to lightcone singularities in appropriately smeared boundary correlators, probing physics beyond the horizon.

Abstract: We study gravitational algebras on spacetimes with two extremal surfaces. In the example of a long wormhole with two asymptotic AdS boundaries and two compact extremal surfaces, we discuss the assignment of gravitational algebras to various regions bounded by the extremal surfaces and/or asymptotic boundaries. Using the split property, we construct type II algebras from the crossed product in the left exterior, right exterior, the middle ``python's lunch'' region, and their complement regions. We also study the case where only the area sum operator or area difference operator is included as part of the gravitational algebra. This can be achieved by picking the appropriate microcanonical ensemble, and these gravitational algebras can either be type II or type III depending on the region. In the case where we include only the area difference mode, the crossed product gives rise to a weight that restricts to a trace on the middle region. Differences of relative entropies with respect to this weight give differences in generalized entropies. This provides an algebraic understanding of the order parameter that controls the phase transitions between entanglement wedges. We emphasize the role of operator-valued weights used in our construction.

We provide an interpretation for the equivalence of the two computations with the canonical formalism of gravity.
  Specifically, by taking use of the canonical formalism, we reformulate both computations into the ones with a similar form. Here, in both reformulated computations, the butterfly velocity is computed from applying a given set of initial data into the constraint equations. And the sets of initial data of both computations have a similar structure.
  We then interpret the equivalence of the two computations as from the similar form of the reformulated computations.

Abstract: We consider a spacetime singularity at $t = 0$ arising in a Kasner-type metric that solves the gravitational equations modified by quantum effects of a conformal field theory (CFT). The resulting constraints can be solved efficiently when expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials. Focusing first on the trace part of the modified gravitational equation, we determine the corresponding solution surfaces in Kasner-parameter space. The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $η= A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations. Among the admissible solutions, we identify, in particular, those that develop a curvature singularity while remaining geodesically complete.

When the interval is adjacent to the boundary, we find numerical evidence that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local, except for the limiting cases of the massless scalar satisfying either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. When the interval is separated from the boundary, the numerical analysis indicates that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local for all these boundary conditions and any value of the mass.

Abstract: In the study of quantum-mechanical tunneling processes, numerous approaches have been developed to determine the decay rate of states initially confined within a metastable potential region. Virtually all analytical treatments, however, fall into one of two superficially unrelated conceptual frameworks: the resonant-state approach and the instanton method. Whereas the concept of resonant states and their associated decay widths is grounded in physical reasoning by capturing the regime of uniform probability decay, the instanton method lacks a comparably clear physical interpretation. We demonstrate the equivalence of the two approaches, revealing that the contour-deformation prescription in the functional integral put forward by Callan and Coleman directly corresponds to the outgoing Gamow--Siegert boundary conditions defining resonant states.

Abstract: We review and elaborate on the issue of 3d world volume supersymmetry that appears as a residual part of global target space supersymmetry in the BST supermembrane action. While there is no direct ``spinning membrane'' analog of the world-volume supersymmetric spinning string action that could be obtained by coupling $D$ copies of 3d scalar multiplet to 3d supergravity, we discuss how one may construct an $N=1$ 3d supersymmetric analog of the derivative expansion of the bosonic membrane action in static gauge. We compare the resulting $N=1$ supersymmetric action for eight 3d scalar multiplets to the $N=8$ 3d supersymmetric action describing the $D=11$ supermembrane in the static gauge. The two actions are not equivalent which is related to the fact that the full $N=8$ supersymmetry of the static-gauge $D=11$ supermembrane action can be realised only if the fermions are described by an $SO(8)$ spinor rather than vector. The two actions are still directly related in special dimensions $D=4$ and 5. We also compute the one-loop world-volume scattering amplitudes for the two theories, finding that they indeed agree for $D=4,5$ but disagree for $D=11$.

Abstract: We investigate the Magnus expansion of the $N$-operator in relativistic quantum field theory, which is related to the $S$-matrix via $S = e^{iN}$. We develop direct methods to compute matrix elements of the $N$-operator, which we refer to as Magnus amplitudes, bypassing scattering amplitudes entirely. At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, with each diagram weighted by factors that we identify as Murua coefficients. At loop level this structure is augmented by the Hadamard cut function, and we establish remarkable relations between loop- and tree-level Magnus amplitudes. Among these, we find that $n$-point one-loop Magnus amplitudes are entirely determined by phase-space integrals of forward limits of $(n{+}2)$-point tree-level amplitudes, and hence related to Murua coefficients, and we generalise this to a class of higher-loop contributions. Furthermore, in the case of heavy particles interacting via massless mediators, we conjecture that Magnus diagrams that contribute to the classical limit are always given by forward limits of trees, and we show this explicitly in a one-loop example. We derive these results studying theories of scalar fields with cubic interactions, but our methods are applicable to general theories as well as to integral functions appearing in gravitational-wave computations. Given that Magnus amplitudes are free of hyper-classical terms, and the known relations between Magnus amplitudes and the radial action, our results lay the groundwork for systematic and efficient calculations of classical observables from quantum field theory.

Abstract: In this note, we describe how the study of backgrounds for general quantum systems can be formulated in terms of the representation theory of abstract $C^*$ algebras. We illustrate our general framework through two example systems: superconductivity and perturbative quantum gravity. In both cases, spontaneously broken symmetries imply the existence of unitarily inequivalent Hilbert spaces that play the role of distinct backgrounds relative to which observables are measured. Background independence can be realized by gauging the broken symmetry; extending the algebra of observables for the theory to include new physical processes that intertwine between these disjoint representations. From the point of view of the background independent theory, different backgrounds have an interpretation as different vacuum expectation values of these intertwining operators. In superconductivity, the intertwiners are intimately related to the Josephson effect. In gravity, they are related to geometric fluctuations. We explain how this framework is connected to recent work on generalized symmetries and algebraic extensions. To this end, we close with some remarks about how the operator algebra of a closed universe may arise from a generalized symmetry associated with the inclusion of the causal wedge inside the entanglement wedge by appealing to subregion-subalgebra duality.

Abstract: We show that 3d gravity on manifolds that are topologically a Riemann surface times an interval $Σ_{g,n}\times I$ with end-of-the-world branes at the ends of the interval is described by a random matrix model, namely the Virasoro minimal string. Because these manifolds have $n$ annular asymptotic boundaries, the path integrals naturally correspond to spectral correlators of open strings upon inverse Fourier transforms. For $g=0$ and $n=2$, we carry out an explicit path integration and find precise agreement with the universal random matrix expression. For Riemann surfaces with negative Euler characteristic, we evaluate the path integral as a gravitational inner product between states prepared by two copies of Virasoro TQFT. Along the way, we clarify the effects of gauging the mapping class group and the connection to chiral 3d gravity.

Motivation: Understanding critical phenomena and phase transitions is fundamental in theoretical physics, requiring precise calculations for models like the O(N) model.

Method: Loop expansion up to six loops with calculations involving Feynman diagrams, renormalization, and anomalous dimensions.

Result: New six-loop results for subleading corrections plus a four-loop update to known γ_{2n} in O(N).

Conclusion: Consistent predictions for leading corrections with new subleading data supporting all-loop approaches. This reinforces the role of loop expansions in verifying broader theories.

Abstract: We consider a class of singlet operators $(φ^2)^n$ in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model with $λ^2 φ^6$ interaction. Recently, the corresponding anomalous dimensions $γ_{2n}$ were computed by semiclassical methods and the all-loop result for the leading-$n$ corrections in the small $λ$ limit was found. In this letter, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for the all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $γ_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.

Abstract: Array configuration is one of the effective ways to increase the output power of terahertz oscillators using resonant tunneling diodes. Mutual locking between the array elements results in coherent single-spectrum oscillation and a narrow radiation beam. However, frequency variation between elements disturbs the mutual locking. In this paper, the frequency variation that can be tolerated for mutual locking is approximately derived for an array with arbitrary coupling configuration. Using this result, the element-number dependence of the frequency variation tolerance for 1D and 2D arrays is calculated. In 1D arrays, the frequency variation tolerance decreases inversely proportional to the square root of the element number. In 2D arrays, as the number of columns is increased while keeping the number of elements per column constant, the frequency variation tolerance increases for small number of columns, reaches a maximum at square configuration, and then decreases with increasing number of columns. The element-number dependence in 2D arrays is smaller than that in 1D arrays.

Abstract: In recent decades, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based gyroscopes have been employed to meet positioning and navigation demands of a plethora of commercially available devices. Most of such gyroscopes rely on electrostatic actuators with nanometer-scale air gaps$\unicode{x2013}$an architecture that enables large particle velocities in a proof mass and, consequently, high Coriolis-force sensitivity to angular velocity$\unicode{x2013}$but is inherently susceptible to damage under shock and vibration. This vulnerability is typically mitigated by purposely reducing gyroscopic sensitivity, thereby compromising readout accuracy. Microacoustic gyroscopes, by contrast, offer greater resilience to shock and vibration but currently exhibit significantly lower sensitivities. This limitation stems from the low dynamic compliance of the modes they employ$\unicode{x2013}$typically Lamb or Rayleigh modes$\unicode{x2013}$which restricts their maximum achievable particle velocity. This work presents a piezoelectric microacoustic device that overcomes this fundamental constraint by harnessing a topological interface state at the boundary between two microscale metamaterial structures. We theoretically and experimentally show that this state exhibits much higher modal compliance than Lamb or Rayleigh modes. This enables record-high particle velocities (>51 m/s) never reached, due to material limits, by any previously demonstrated piezoelectric gyroscope.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for efficient, low-cost source detection systems using compressive sensing and acoustic metamaterials, with broad applications in monitoring and tracking.

Abstract: Acoustic metamaterials provide new opportunities for compact and efficient wavefront manipulation, extending beyond conventional bulky and power-intensive phased-arrays. In this work, we exploit the spatial encoding properties of the acoustic metagrating aperture to transform incident acoustic fields into compressed measurements for single-pixel acoustic source localisation. The proposed method enables accurate direction finding of acoustic sources over both 180 and 360 degrees angular ranges. Numerical simulations confirm the robustness of the metagrating-based compressive sensing approach against noise and limited sampling. Experimental validation is conducted to verify its feasibility with practical metagrating prototyes. Compared wiith tranditional array-based localisation techniques, the single-pixel metagrating system significantly reduces hardward complexity while maintaining high localisation accuracy. These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating compressive sensing with acoustic metagratings for compact, low-cost, scalable source detection systems, with prospective applications in industrial monitoring, target tracking and non-destructive health monitoring.

Abstract: Gallium-based liquid metals, as a broad category of emerging functional materials with unique physical, chemical, and biological properties, offer numerous possibilities for advancing intelligent systems. However, a basic query persistently remains for the complex liquid metal system: Is there a minimal functional unit that can fully capture its diversity of morphology and function? Cells, as the most basic structural and functional units of life, are small in scale but have complex structures, functions, and life activities. Analogous to nature, this article proposes the concept of liquid metal cells, and systematically explores their construction routes, sensing capabilities, motion behaviors, and potential applications. We first construct a multi-phase composite structure with liquid metal as the nucleus, ionic solution as the cytoplasm, and polymer as the cell membrane by developing a layered cryogenic molding method. Furthermore, we reveal that liquid metal cells exhibit inherently versatile responsive characteristics and self-adaptive behaviors to thermal, pressure, chemical, electrical, and magnetic fields, indicating "small world, vast potential". Based on these fundamental findings, we finally demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing liquid metal cells as sensors, fluidic valves, and material transport carriers in flow channels through dynamic control.

TL;DR: PHPS'n Ceremony in Wind and Solar-Dominated Energy Systems, Optionally Waste Heat Recovery Aids Surroundings


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of Carnot batteries (PHPS) in wind and solar-dominated nations, focusing on their integration in electricity and heating systems.

Method: The study uses the open-source PyPSA framework to model sector-coupled electricity and heating systems, comparing individual and district heating configurations with and without waste heat recovery.

Result: PHPS shows high viability in individual heating systems, particularly in wind-dominated regions because of low cost per energy capacity, which helps offset long-term energy fluctuations. Waste heat recovery is crucial for PHPS's competitiveness, allowing it to replace lithium-ion batteries. Conversely, PHPS struggles in district heating systems, which favor centralized storage solutions. Viability mainly depends on cost efficiency and thermal conversion efficiency.

Conclusion: PHPS complements existing storage technologies by offering dispatchable electricity and heat, but its effectiveness strongly depends on regional context, such as climate, system configuration, and competition from other storage technologies.

Abstract: This study assesses the role of Power-to-Heat-to-Power Storage (PHPS) systems, also known as Carnot batteries, in the national energy system of a wind-dominated (Denmark) and a solar-dominated (Spain) region. Using the open-source PyPSA framework, we model sector-coupled electricity and heating systems, and evaluate individual and district heating configurations for heat provision at residential level, with and without PHPS waste heat recovery. Our results show that PHPS is most viable in individual heating systems, and in wind-dominated locations, where its low cost per energy capacity enables it to balance long-duration fluctuations. Moreover, waste heat recovery is essential to enhance PHPS competitiveness, allowing it to displace lithium-ion batteries. Conversely, PHPS is largely outcompeted in district heating systems, which favour low-cost centralized energy storage. Sensitivity analysis highlights that PHPS viability depends primarily on achieving low energy capacity costs and maintaining reasonable heat-to-power conversion efficiencies. Overall, while PHPS complements existing storage technologies by providing dispatchable electricity and heat, its potential adoption is highly context-dependent, influenced by climate, heating system configuration, and competing storage costs.

TL;DR: A proposed Metal-Gate Blocking Layer (GBL)-Ferroelectric-Tunnel Dielectric Layer (TDL)-Ferroelectric-Channel Insulator (Ch.IL)-Si structure aimed at increasing the memory.write capability for Fe-NAND applications, but the structure exhibits large retention loss (RL). The research investigates this RL issue by varying the physical thickness of the GBL and TDL and analyzing the energy bands. The RL is attributed to the electric field direction across the TDL reducing the potential barrier provided by the ferroelectric near the silicon substrate. The proposed solutions include redesigning the gate structure to reduce RL by 12% or decreasing the pulse amplitude to achieve 0.2% RL. This study enhances understanding of the RL mechanism in FeFETs with MIFIFIS structure and provides guidance for improving reliability in FeFETs.

Motivation: FeFETs, being crucial components in non-volatile memory devices, require reliable operation. The concept of MIFIFIS aims to enhance memory.write capability, but challenges like high retention loss affect practicality. This study seeks to elucidate and mitigate the retention loss issue.

Method: Investigated by varying the physical thickness of GBL and TDL, analyzing energy bands of the gate structure to understand the physical mechanism behind retention loss in FeFETs with MIFIFIS gate structure.

Result: The retention loss reduces to 12% by redesigning the gate structure and to 0.2% by decreasing the pulse amplitude.

Conclusion: This work provides a deeper understanding of the retention loss mechanism in FeFETs with MIFIFIS structures and offers practical solutions to improve device reliability, advancing FeFET-based memory technologies.

Abstract: A Metal-Gate Blocking Layer (GBL)- Ferroelectric-Tunnel Dielectric Layer (TDL)-Ferroelectric -Channel Insulator (Ch.IL)-Si (MIFIFIS) structure is proposed to achieve a larger MW for applications in Fe-NAND. However, the large retention loss (RL) in the MIFIFIS structure restricts its application. In this work, we vary the physical thickness of the GBL and TDL, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the energy bands of the gate structure to investigate the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS structure. The physical origin of the RL is that the electric field direction across the TDL reduces the potential barrier provided by the ferroelectric near the silicon substrate. Based on the above physical mechanism, the RL can be reduced to 12% and 0.2% by redesigning the gate structure or reducing the pulse amplitude, respectively. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of the physical mechanism behind the RL in FeFETs with the MIFIFIS gate structure. It provides guidance for enhancing the reliability of FeFETs.

Result: 研究发现债务增加短期内促进经济增长，但伴随高风险及碳排放。当经济增长率低于债务利率时，金融体系将步入结构不稳定阶段。研究提出了一个最优加薪前沿，指出超过一定债务水平将无法促进实际财富增长，反而增加 Default 和碳债务风险。研究证实了债务、GDP 和碳排放之间的强相关性，无论政治体系如何。

Conclusion: 研究认为，在现有金融体系中，信贷扩张会促进经济增长和碳排放，从而迫使经济沿着高碳排放轨迹运行，即便能源效率改进通过创新提高。研究建议需要承认债务与增长的相互依存性，并制定政策以确保金融系统与碳中和目标保持一致。

Abstract: We develop a macro-financial model that establishes a link between credit dynamics, economic growth, and cumulative carbon emissions. It is based on an extension of Kelly's model, a framework derived from information theory and investment theory, applied here to understand macro-financial and climate dynamics. This approach complements traditional Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) by explicitly linking financial dynamics to cumulative emissions, enabling the assessment of policy alignment (or misalignment) with net-zero pathways. We find that injecting debt into the system increases short-term production gains, but at the expense of higher bankruptcy risk and cumulative emissions. Thus, the model reveals a double constraint: financially, debt requires growth to be repaid; ecologically, growth requires energy, and therefore emissions. When the intrinsic growth rate falls below the interest rate, the probability of solvency drops to zero: the economy enters a zone of structural instability. The model then identifies an optimal leverage frontier: beyond a certain threshold, additional debt no longer fuels real wealth; it only increases the risk of bankruptcy and carbon debt. Our model is calibrated using multi-decade macroeconomic and emissions data from several countries, including the United States, China, France, and Denmark. Our results confirm that the correlation between cumulative debt, cumulative GDP, and cumulative emissions remains strong, regardless of the political structure of credit. In our current financial system, credit expansion amplifies GDP growth and associated emissions, thereby locking economies into higher cumulative carbon trajectories, even as energy efficiency improves through innovation.

Abstract: Strongly interacting many-body systems often show collective properties that are non-trivially related to the microscopic degrees of freedom. Collectivity is responsible for intriguing ground state properties, for example, in superconductors. However, collective effects may also govern the non-equilibrium response of quantum systems, not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum field theories modeling the properties of our universe. Understanding emergent collective dynamics from first principles, in particular in non-perturbative regimes, is therefore one of the central challenges in quantum many-body physics. Here we report on the observation of collective cluster nucleation in 2D quantum Ising systems realized in an atomic Rydberg array. We observe a confined regime in which the steady-state cluster size is energy-dependent and a deconfined regime characterized by kinetically constrained dynamics of cluster nucleation. Our results mark a qualitative leap for quantum simulations with Rydberg arrays and shed light on highly collective non-equilibrium processes in one of the most important textbook models of condensed matter physics with relevance from quantum magnets and the kinetics of glass formers to cosmology.

Abstract: The study of the conversion of ultracold atoms into molecules has long remained a hot topic in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. However, most prior research has focused on diatomic molecules, with relatively scarce exploration of polyatomic molecules. Here we propose a two-step strategy for the formation of stable ultracold tetraatomic molecules. We first suggest a generalized nonlinear stimulated Raman exact passage (STIREP) technique for the coherent conversion of ultracold atoms to tetraatomic molecules, which is subsequently followed by a chainwise-STIREP technique to transfer the resulting molecules into a sufficiently stable ground state. Through systematic numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the proposed two-step strategy holds great potential for enabling the robust, fast, and efficient formation of stable ultracold tetraatomic molecules.

Abstract: We develop a unified framework to compute band-geometric quantities in multiband systems whose low-energy Hamiltonians realize arbitrary $SU(2)$ representations. Exploiting the presence of a quantization axis, we use the Wigner--Eckart theorem to identify the allowed interband matrix elements and obtain compact analytic expressions for the quantum geometric tensor, the orbital magnetic moment, and the resulting orbital transport coefficients. The formalism applies to both multifold fermions and gapped $SU(2)$ models. Its versatility is demonstrated through explicit calculations in representative $SU(3)$ and $SU(4)$ settings, where orbital Edelstein and orbital Hall responses arise naturally from the antisymmetric components of the band geometry. Our results reveal a universal link between the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian and emergent orbitronic phenomena.

Abstract: Superconducting weak-link junctions host electron--hole hybridized excitations called Andreev bound states. These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters. Our results highlight the possibilities in the new field of Andreev optoelectronics.

Abstract: Studies of the 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) have primarily emphasized transport features that mimic the well-established 2D QHE. In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena.

Abstract: Despite the decades that have passed since the discovery of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and its apparent simplicity, this method is still often subject to experimental errors and misinterpretations when applied to 2D semiconductors. The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors.

Abstract: In this work we look into how the contact material influences the local charge properties of a p-type CdTe-based quantum well. We study five metals deposited as 10 nm layers on the sample surface: Au, Ag, Cr, Ni and Ti. We use magneto-spectroscopy to discriminate their charge states through monitoring the Zeeman shifts at singlet-triplet transitions. Most tested metals retain the original p-type of the QW, while gold and nickel coverage flips the local doping to n-type. This is attributed to a robust bonding of these two metals to the semiconductor, efficiently passivating its surface and thus improving electron diffusion from the metal to the quantum well.

Abstract: We investigate circular current in both ordered and disordered Hubbard quantum rings threaded by magnetic flux, employing exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock mean-field approach within the tight-binding framework. The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.

Abstract: The edge spin galvanic effect (ESGE) in $d$-wave altermagnets is proposed. ESGE is a creation of an electrical current flowing along the edge of the sample, which is driven by the spin orientation of charge carriers. The ESGE current is formed owing to the altermagnetic spin splitting and the scattering of carriers by the edge of the sample. The current is sensitive to the orientation of the edge in respect to the main axes of the altermagnet. The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector. We also propose the pure spin edge photocurrent excited by polarized radiation and formed at the edges of a sample. Its dependence on the radiation polarization and frequency is analyzed. The application of an external magnetic field converts this pure spin photocurrent into an electric current along the edge.

Abstract: The emergence of intelligent matter has sparked significant interest in next generation technologies. We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light.

Abstract: Porphyrins are organic molecules that exhibit excellent opto-electronics properties, making them suitable for a variety of applications. Nevertheless, their functionality strongly depends on the surface onto which they are deposited, and on the interaction between the molecules and the substrate itself, which often leads to an undesired alteration in their electronic properties. In this study, we use a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface as a buffer layer for the electronic decoupling of Zinc-TetraPhenylPorphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules. Using a combination of complementary techniques, such as Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) as well as Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) techniques, it is shown how the charge transfer from the metal, responsible for quenching the ZnTPP lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO) levels, is effectively prevented by the presence of a phosphorus reconstruction in between.

Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.

Abstract: We demonstrate high-fidelity single qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot fabricated in an industrial 300 mm wafer process on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer using electron spin resonance. A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $μ$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring topological properties and axionic effects in quantum materials.

Method: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments using SmB6 nanowires, analysis of voltage-induced magnetization.

Result: Observation of tip moments sensitive to extremely small voltages, reversible and tunable, indicating axionic $Eowcdot B$ coupling.

Conclusion: Provides a new method for studying axionic electrodynamics, opening future applications in spintronics and quantum materials research.

Abstract: Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $μ_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.

Abstract: We introduce a multimode superconducting inductor architecture that enables radio-frequency reflectometry at multiple discrete frequencies up to 2 GHz, addressing limitations of conventional single-mode designs. The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization.

Abstract: Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$ρ_{a}(0)$] and typical [$ρ_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schläfli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $ρ_{a}(0)$ and $ρ_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $ρ_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $ρ_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

Abstract: We present recent results on high-power guiding and laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the ELBA beamline at ELI Beamlines, using the L3-HAPLS laser system (13 J, 30 fs, 0.2 Hz). By employing self-waveguiding in a 20 cm plasma channel in helium, we achieved stable acceleration of electron beams to energies approaching 5 GeV. A novel all-reflective optical setup, including an off-axis reflective axicon, enabled efficient acceleration at 0.2 Hz and guiding at repetition rates up to 3.3 Hz. This compact single laser, single compressor implementation of plasma channels for electron acceleration stabilizes electron pointing and enhances energy gain without requiring modifications to the laser system, paving the way for broader adoption of the technology across user facilities.

TL;DR: The paper investigates chaotic imprints in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, involving a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole. Using the kludge scheme and recurrence analysis, they show that chaotic orbits produce broader frequency spectra with higher energy emission rates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to understand the chaotic behavior in gravitational waves from such extreme astrophysical systems, potentially offering new insights into black hole physics and dark matter environments.

Method: Numerical simulations with the kludge scheme and recurrence analysis were conducted to study the gravitational waveforms from orbits with varying chaoticity.

Result: Chaotic orbits produce distinct gravitational wave signatures, and these signals are distinguishable from non-chaotic ones. The findings suggest that future space-based gravitational wave observatories could detect these chaotic imprints, aiding in the study of black hole physics and dark matter within galactic nuclei.

Conclusion: This work contributes to understanding chaotic dynamics in gravitational waves, particularly in the context of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, and opens new avenues for detecting these signals with advanced instruments like LISA.

Abstract: We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.

Abstract: This manuscript endeavors to construct a pilgrim dark energy framework within the $f\mathbb{(Q,T)}$ gravity theory, employing a correspondence approach aligned with a non-interacting model that incorporates pressureless matter alongside a power-law scale factor. Here $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ represent the non-metricity and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. This extended modified gravity framework accurately replicates various epochs in the cosmological history. The $f\mathbb{(Q,T)}$ gravity models are utilized to derive the equation of state parameter, phase planes and squared speed of sound. The analysis reveals that the reconstructed model exhibits an increasing or decreasing trend with the pilgrim dark energy parameter. The equation of state parameter characterizes the phantom regime, while the squared speed of sound parameter provides a stable framework for examining the ongoing cosmic evolution. The $ω_{DE}-ω'_{DE}$ plane trajectories reveal the freezing region, while the $r-s$ phase plane shows the Chaplygin gas model. It is important to highlight that our findings align with the most recent observational data.

Abstract: We prove the Spacetime Penrose Inequality: for any asymptotically flat initial data set satisfying the Dominant Energy Condition, the ADM mass is bounded below by the square root of the trapped surface area divided by 16 pi, with equality only for Schwarzschild. Unlike previous partial results, our proof is unconditional and holds for any trapped surface regardless of stability or topology.
  The proof combines the generalized Jang equation with the p-harmonic level set method. We establish Fredholm solvability in weighted Sobolev spaces, verify that Jang-conformal metrics with distributional curvature satisfy all required analytic hypotheses, prove mean curvature jump positivity for stable horizons, and justify the double limit with explicit bounds.
  This resolves Penrose's 1973 conjecture, a central open problem in mathematical relativity for over fifty years.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with orbital periods exceeding the observational timescale of mHz gravitational wave observatories. In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals ``popcorn EMRIs.'' We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P>1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis.

### [113] [Asymmetric excitation of left- vs right-handed photons in accelerating waveguides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04188)
*Adrian del Rio*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that the electromagnetic duality symmetry of Maxwell's equations in vacuum, which conserves circular polarization Q, is not conserved in quantum field theory for observers in gravitational fields. The study shows that this symmetry can be restored in empty waveguides with specific boundary conditions, despite the waveguide undergoing acceleration. The quantization of source-free Maxwell theory in a rotating and accelerating waveguide reveals that the expectation value of Q is not conserved in the vacuum state. Frame-dragging effects lead to a spectral asymmetry between right- and left-handed photons, which an accelerated detector can detect as photon-pair excitation imbalances. This effect is a violation of the classical duality symmetry in quantum theory, holding even in flat spacetime with non-inertial reference frames. The findings provide a basis for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into electromagnetic duality and its quantum implications is fundamental to understanding the interplay between classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, particularly in relativistic systems and gravity-related phenomena.

Method: The study employs quantum field theory in curved spacetime and accelerated frames, using mathematical analysis and theoretical modeling to evaluate the symmetry of Q in different scenarios, including inertial and accelerated observers, with and without gravitational fields.

Result: The key results are as follows: 1) In flat spacetime, accelerated observers exhibit a violation of the duality symmetry, leading to a loss of Q conservation. 2) In waveguides with rotational acceleration, despite the expectation of duality, the vacuum still induces a spectral asymmetry in photon modes. 3) Accelerated detectors can observe photon-pair asymmetry in the quantum vacuum, providing a direct experimental signature of the symmetry violation.

Conclusion: The paper conclusively shows that electromagnetic duality symmetry is broken in quantum systems, even under non-inertial and absence of gravity. It provides a concrete example for future experimental studies in analogue gravity setups, where the effects of acceleration and rotation can be artificially induced to observe the violation of duality symmetry.

Abstract: The electromagnetic duality symmetry of Maxwell's equations in vacuum implies that the circular polarization $Q$ of classical electromagnetic waves is conserved. In quantum field theory, the normal-ordered operator $\hat Q$ represents the difference between the number operators of right- and left-handed photons. Previous studies have shown that its expectation value is not conserved for observers propagating in a gravitational field. Here, we show that this Noether symmetry can also be realized in empty waveguides with duality-preserving boundary conditions, and we quantize the source-free Maxwell theory inside a long, cylindrical waveguide undergoing both linear and rotational acceleration from rest. In the vacuum $|0\rangle$ associated to inertial observers, we find that the expectation value $\langle 0| \hat Q |0\rangle $ fails to be conserved for observers co-moving with the waveguide. In particular, frame-dragging effects induce a spectral asymmetry between the right- and left-handed field modes at late times. As a consequence, accelerated detectors co-moving with the rotating waveguide can detect photon-pair excitations from the quantum vacuum, exhibiting an imbalance between opposite helicity modes. This is a relativistic quantum effect, which shows that the classical conservation law associated with duality symmetry is broken in the quantum theory even in flat spacetime, provided we work with non-inertial systems. Our analysis provides a concrete proof of concept for testing this effect in analogue gravity platforms.

*Martin Taylor,Renato Velozo Ruiz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Vlasov equation on expanding cosmological tori with Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metrics, focusing on the decay rates of spatial density and phase mixing effects under different expansion rates and initial data smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of the Vlasov equation in expanding cosmological spaces is crucial for modeling the large-scale structure of the universe and the dynamics of collisionless matter under cosmic expansion.

Method: The authors employ a combination of commuting vector fields and combinatorial properties of associated differential operators to analyze the decay rates of the solution. A dyadic localisation in physical space is used to handle non-compact solutions with suitable decay.

Result: For expansion rates $t^q$ with $0 < q < 1/2$, the spatial density decays at $t^{-6q}$, with phase mixing enhancing this decay polynomially for Sobolev data and super-polynomially for analytic data. At the borderline $t^{1/2}$, a logarithmic enhancement is observed for Sobolev data and a super-logarithmic enhancement for analytic data.

Conclusion: The paper provides a detailed analysis of the decay and phase mixing effects in the Vlasov equation under varying expansion rates and initial data, revealing how the expansion rate, from subcritical to borderline, affects the solution's decay and mixing behavior.

Abstract: We consider the Vlasov equation on slowly expanding isotropic homogeneous tori, described by the Friedmann--Lemaître--Robertson--Walker cosmological spacetimes. For expansion rate $t^q$, with $0< q<\frac{1}{2}$ (excluding certain exceptional values), we show that the spatial density decays at the rate $t^{-6q}$ and that, when the spatial average is removed, the density decays at an enhanced rate due to a phase mixing effect. This enhancement is polynomial for Sobolev initial data and super-polynomial, but sub-exponential, for real analytic initial data. We further show that, when the expansion rate is the borderline $t^{\frac{1}{2}}$ -- the rate which describes a radiation filled universe -- a degenerate phase mixing effect results in a logarithmic enhancement for Sobolev initial data and a super-logarithmic enhancement (in fact, a gain of $\exp(-μ(\log t)^ε)$ for some $μ,ε>0$) for analytic initial data. The proof is based on a collection of commuting vector fields, and certain combinatorial properties of an associated collection of differential operators. The vector fields are not explicit, but are shown to have good properties when $t$ is large with respect to the momentum support of the solution. A physical space dyadic localisation is employed to treat non-compactly supported (in particular, non-trivial real analytic) but suitably decaying solutions.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines how astrophysical disks affect the absorption of massless scalar fields by dirty wormholes. Perturbations in the absorption spectrum arise from the complex structure of the fields around them, but the presence of surrounding matter keeps most spectral lines visible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the impact of astrophysical environments on exotic objects like wormholes helps understand how external matter affects fundamental particle interactions and the observable signatures of such objects.

Method: The study employs a detailed analysis of null geodesics and the resulting spacetime structure around dirty wormholes, incorporating intricate matter distributions to model real astrophysical settings.

Result: The research reveals that while the overall absorption spectrum changes, the primary spectral lines remain detectable, indicating that the astrophysical environment leaves characteristic imprints on the observation of wormhole signatures.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of wormhole astrophysics and provides insights into how external matter can influence the detectability of exotic compact objects.

Abstract: Astrophysical objects like black holes are usually surrounded by matter in the form of accretion disks or jets of matter. These astrophysical scenarios are expected to introduce novel phenomenology in the scattering of particles and fields. Wormholes are viable candidates for exotic compact objects that can mimic some black hole properties. Hence, it is natural to wonder what would happen if the central astrophysical object were a wormhole, instead of a black hole. We investigate the astrophysical environment effect on the absorption of a massless scalar field by a dirty wormhole surrounded by a thick shell of matter. We study null geodesics around these dirty wormholes and analyze under which conditions new pairs of light rings can appear. The presence of new stable light rings allows new quasibound states in the spacetime, apart from the ones trapped near the throat. Thus, the astrophysical environment can introduce deviations in the absorption bands. Remarkably, although heavy and dense distributions of matter are considered surrounding the wormhole, the position of most of the spectral lines in the absorption bands is preserved, indicating that the astrophysical environment cannot hide some fingerprints of the central object.

What is more, upon comparison to available supernovae data, the best fit numerical value of the unique free parameter of the model is determined. We show graphically all the cosmological quantities of interest versus red-shift, such as the deceleration parameter, dark energy equation of state parameter, etc. The statefinders and the age of the Universe are also computed. Finally, a comparison to the $Λ$-CDM model is made as well.

Abstract: We study the linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars under generic perturbations. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we demonstrate that, as expected, the ground state is always mode-stable. Additionally, we identify several mode-stable spherically symmetric excited states, including stationary states of constant and radial polarization, as well as multi-frequency states in case that the spin-spin selfinteraction vanishes. The existence of stable excited states may have implications for spin-$1$ ultralight dark matter models.

Abstract: We investigate the absorption of massless scalar waves by three distinct hairy black hole solutions obtained through the gravitational decoupling method, considering the weak, the strong or the dominant energy conditions. Remarkably, in certain configurations of hairy black holes associated with the fulfillment of the weak energy condition, quasibound states may appear, resulting in Breit-Wigner-like resonances in their absorption profile. These quasibound states (and consequently the spectral lines in the absorption spectrum) can be related to stable light rings in the spacetime, a structure often associated with horizonless exotic compact objects, such as wormholes. We investigate how the gravitational decoupling method introduces novel light ring structures in hairy black holes and influences the absorption spectra through its deformation parameters. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with well-known approximations.

Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are designed for wave sources in the millihertz band with different locations and orientations.
  Time-delay interferometry (TDI) technique is an indispensable ingredient in space-borne GW detection that effectively suppresses the laser phase noise.
  The abundant TDI solutions derived in the literature also feature distinct angular-dependent sensitivities.
  Because a GW source's angular location is unknown prior to the signals' detection, a solid-angle average is often performed when analyzing the sensitivity function of a given TDI combination.
  The present study explores the angular dependence of the detector's sensitivity.
  This detail is relevant, because once the initial detection is achieved, the source's location can be extracted and used to provide information on a refined TDI combination tailored for the specific GW source.
  As the TDI technique is a post-processing algorithm, such a procedure can be implemented in practice.
  We evaluate the angular dependence of the detector's response function to the GW signals for different TDI combinations as a function of the orientation angles.
  Moreover, we classify the response functions into seven categories at the low-frequency limit, leveraging the characteristics of the underlying geometrical TDI combinations.
  By further averaging out the azimuthal angle $φ_D$ in the detector's plane, the main features of the resulting response functions and their zenithal dependence with respect to the GW source are scrutinized.
  The findings presented in this work provide pertinent insights for ongoing space-borne detector programs.

<details>

Motivation: 研究RN黑洞的热力学和几何特性有助于深入理解黑洞的宏观行为和量子性质。通过分析热力学曲率-R，可以揭示黑洞相变的存在与否及其条件，这不仅丰富了高温统计力学的理解，也是探索黑洞信息悖论和量子引力的重要途径。

Method: 研究使用热力学统计方法，并结合欧几里得路径积分方法对热力学几何度量进行分析。通过在不同系综（规范系综、正则系综、 Grand 正则系综等）下计算热力学曲率标量R，并利用欧氏作用量的周期性，得出了相关结论。

Result: 在固定电荷（规范系综）下，D维RN黑洞的 Ruppeiner 曲几何 RN奇点度量在$D>4$表现出强分歧，要么正处于第二类相变的临界点。而在允许所有广延变量允许波动（如正则系综或固定压力）时，Ruppeiner 度量表现出平坦性，这意味着相变可能不存在或退化。此外，热力学几何度量与欧几里得作用量的周期性之间的一一对应关系得到了证实，欧几里得时间周期（即温度逆）在连接这两方面的作用至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，RN黑洞在D>4时在规范系综下具有 Ruppeiner 发散的曲几何度量，指示第二类相变的存在。而允许所有广延变量允许波动时，Ruppeiner 度量可以表现出平坦性，意味着相变可能不存在或退化。此外，热力学几何度量与欧几里得方法的周期性之间存在一一对应关系，特别是欧几里得时间周期在连接这两方面中起到桥梁作用。这些发现为理解RN黑洞的热力学性质和量子特征提供了新的视角。研究结果还为探索黑洞相变和量子引力理论提供了理论依据。这也为未来研究RN黑洞在不同系综下的热力学行为及量子效应提供了参考框架。总的来说，该研究在RN黑洞的热力学和几何特性研究方面取得了一定的理论进展，为更深入的探索奠定了基础。 

Abstract: This paper studies the thermodynamics and Ruppeiner geometry of D-dimensional RN black holes. We analyze the thermodynamic curvature scalar $R$ in various thermodynamic ensembles. It is found that in an ensemble of fixed charge (canonical ensemble), the Ruppeiner curvature is curved and diverges at a critical point, indicating the existence of a phase transition for $D > 4$. In contrast, when all extensive variables are allowed to fluctuate (for example, in a grand-canonical ensemble or with pressure fixed), the Ruppeiner geometry can appear flat. We also demonstrate that the thermodynamic geometric metric has a one-to-one correspondence with the periodicity of the Euclidean path integral method. In particular, the inverse temperature (the Euclidean time period) serves as a bridge connecting the thermodynamic geometry and the Euclidean action approach.

Gauge invariance is verified up to second order.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences has provided significant insights into our Universe, and the discovery of new and unique gravitational wave candidates from independent searches remains an ongoing field of research. In this work, we built a hybrid search pipeline that combines matched filtering and deep learning to identify stellar-mass binary black hole candidates from detector strain data. We first present results from a targeted injection study to benchmark the sensitivity of our method and compare it with existing search pipelines. We demonstrate that our hybrid approach has comparable sensitivity for injections with a source-frame chirp mass greater than 25$\,$M$_{\odot}$, and below this threshold our sensitivity drops off for signals with a network SNR less than 15. We also observe that our search method can identify a significant population of unique candidates. Furthermore, we conduct an offline search for gravitational wave candidates in the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK), yielding 31 candidates previously reported by the LVK with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro}\geq0.5$. We identify two other candidates: one previously reported only in a search conducted by the Institute for Advanced Study, and one previously unreported promising new candidate with a $p_{\rm astro}$ of 0.63. This unique candidate has a high chirp mass and a high probability that the primary black hole is an intermediate-mass black hole.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational waves from black hole mergers is crucial fortesting Einstein's general relativity and exploring astrophysical phenomena.

Method: Utilized waveform models for binary black holes in eccentric orbits and statistical analysis based on LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data.

Result: The signal is attributed to two near-equal, first-generation black holes with low spins merging within the pair-instability mass gap. Confirmation of the (4,±4) multipoles with higher evidence than previously reported. The detection of these multipoles extends well into the post-merger phase. Three independent GR tests confirm waveforms, amplitude matches expectations, and parameters within expected ranges.

Conclusion: GW250114 is pivotal for precision gravity testing, supporting confirmations of GR and providing insights into black hole properties and gravitational wave physics.

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of GW250114, the loudest gravitational-wave signal observed to date, using a waveform model capable of describing binary black holes in generic (eccentric and precessing) orbits. Our analysis builds on LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)'s results, finding that the source is consistent at a probability of $\geq 96\%$ with the merger of two first-generation, nearly equal-mass, low-spin black holes, forming a remnant within the pair-instability mass gap. The signal's high signal-to-noise ratio ($\gtrsim 75$) enables the detection of the subdominant $(4,\pm4)$ multipoles, whose presence we confirm with higher evidence than previously reported by the LVK. Restricting the analysis even to post-peak data yields $\log_{10}B\gtrsim 1$ in favor of models including the $(4,\pm4)$ mode, demonstrating that this contribution remains detectable well into the post-merger phase. We further perform three independent tests of general relativity, complementary to those performed by the LVK: a modified residual analysis confirms that our semi-analytical model fully describes the signal without detectable discrepancies; a subdominant mode test finds that the amplitude of the $(4,\pm4)$ multipoles agrees with general-relativistic expectations; and a parameterised analysis of the plunge-merger-ringdown regime recovers the GR expectation within the 50\% credible region for the remnant mass and spin, and within the 90\% interval for the $(2,\pm2)$ peak amplitude. Collectively, these results reinforce GW250114 as a landmark event for a precision test of gravity.

Abstract: The investigation of gravity in higher-dimensional spacetime has transitioned from a mathematical curiosity to a fundamental framework in theoretical physics, catalyzed by the dimensional requirements of String theory and M-theory. In this paper, we explicitly construct a spherically symmetric charged black hole solution in $D \ge 5$ dimensions within a gravity theory featuring an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. For a given mass and electric charge, the model admits a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We demonstrate that, with an appropriate choice of coupling coefficients $α_n$, the central singularity is progressively mitigated as the correction order increases, ultimately resolving into a globally regular spacetime in the limit of infinite-order corrections. Furthermore, the criteria for the existence of extremal black holes are determined.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of spatially homogeneous Friedmann--Robertson--Walker universes filled with a massive scalar field in a neighbourhood of the massless transition $s=1$. At this point the Einstein--scalar system exhibits a codimension--two Hopf--steady--state organising centre whose versal unfolding describes all small deformations of the quadratic model. After reduction to the centre manifold, the dynamics is governed by two slow geometric modes $(r,z)$: the Hopf amplitude $r$, measuring the kinetic departure from de Sitter, and the slowly drifting Hubble mode $z$. We show that the standard slow--roll parameters follow directly from these unfolding variables, $ε\sim\tfrac32 r^{2}$ and $η\sim z$, so that the spectral tilt, tensor--to--scalar ratio, and scalar amplitude arise as universal functions of $(r,z)$, independently of the choice of potential. The two unfolding parameters $(μ_{1},μ_{2})$ classify all perturbations of the quadratic model and can be interpreted physically as controlling the tilt and curvature deformations of generic polynomial inflationary potentials. Thus the near scale--invariance of primordial perturbations emerges as a structural property of the unfolding of the organising centre, providing a potential--independent mechanism for an early phase of accelerated expansion. We discuss the implications of this geometric framework for the interpretation and classification of inflationary models.

Abstract: We present a systematic post-Newtonian treatment of binary charged black holes immersed in external magnetic fields within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By incorporating a uniform external magnetic field into the two-body Lagrangian expanded to first post-Newtonian order, we derive the complete equations of motion that capture both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The magnetic Lorentz force fundamentally alters the orbital dynamics, breaking the conservation of linear and angular momentum and inducing transitions from planar to three-dimensional trajectories. Through numerical integration of these equations, we compute the resulting gravitational waveforms and quantify the magnetic field imprints using matched filtering techniques. Our results demonstrate that strong background magnetic fields can substantially modify the orbital evolution and leave distinctive signatures in the gravitational wave signals. These findings provide a promising avenue for detecting charged black holes and probing magnetic field environments through gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: Relativistic black hole collisions are one of the most dramatic astrophysical events that can be imagined. They could provide the ideal condition for searching for possible new physics beyond general relativity. However, such events are presumably rare and difficult to occur under normal conditions. Black holes in a triple system can be accelerated to the relativistic limit and may harbor the chance for a relativistic collision. In this paper, we study the relativistic black hole collisions in a massive black hole background and the capabilities of several current and future gravitational wave detectors in detecting such signals.

Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is essential for constructing nonsingular cosmological scenarios, such as Genesis cosmology, which avoids the initial singularity by initiating cosmic evolution from an asymptotically Minkowski state. To address theoretical concerns regarding the accumulation of negative energy, the smeared null energy condition (SNEC) has been proposed as a quantum-motivated, semi-local bound on NEC violation. In this work, we examine the implications of the SNEC conjecture for Genesis models, typically constructed within generalized Galileon theories. Our results demonstrate that SNEC imposes nontrivial restrictions on the viability of Genesis models, highlighting the SNEC conjecture as a powerful tool for constraining nonsingular cosmological scenarios.

Abstract: The portion of the gravitational energy absorbed by the black hole due to the radial infall of a point mass is known to diverge at leading order in perturbation theory. This divergence is an artifact of the point-particle model, where the contribution of each multipole to the total absorbed energy is observed to be roughly constant. We show explicitly that this divergent energy arises from the infinite energy present in the singular static field arbitrarily close to the point mass, which also flows into the black hole when the particle trajectory crosses the horizon. We perform a multipole decomposition of the linearized gravitational field generated by the point mass near its world line at the black hole horizon. By applying the standard field-theoretical approach to the particle field, we compute the corresponding partial energy and find that it matches the constant multipole contribution.

Motivation: Exploring the thermodynamic differences between isolated black holes and the universe helps understand the fundamental distinctions in their physical behaviors and the implications for quantum gravity.

Method: Theoretical analysis of thermodynamic laws in black hole physics and cosmology, focusing on the role of memory and horizons.

Result: The paper demonstrates that cosmology requires a distinct thermodynamic framework, incorporating memory accumulation and horizon properties, which are absent in black hole thermodynamics.

Conclusion: Quantum gravity theories must account for the unique thermodynamic regime of cosmology, distinguishing it from black hole phenomena, implying that unifying these frameworks requires new microscopic principles beyond simple extrapolation.

Abstract: We show that stationary black holes and the evolving universe belong to fundamentally different thermodynamic regimes: black holes obey ordinary Bekenstein Hawking thermodynamics, whereas cosmology necessarily follows memory-bearing teleodynamics. We show that teleodynamics is not valid for black holes, but is unavoidable in an expanding cosmology. This provides a dynamical, semi-classical realization of the thermodynamic split conjecture and identifies memory accumulation as the natural source of deviations from the area law in cosmology. Our results suggest that quantum gravity should not seek to extrapolate black hole thermodynamics to the universe, but instead must incorporate horizon memory as a fundamental microscopic ingredient and consider cosmological constructions consistent with that.

Abstract: We explore how perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole can redistribute energy among scalar modes and seed turbulent like cascades. We make use of the van der Pol-Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method and derive coupled mode equations that describe near-resonant interactions between neighbouring multipoles. We compare two routes to instability, namely the difference-frequency mixing between adjacent modes and the diagonal (Mathieu) self-modulation channel. We show that, at high multipole number (eikonal limit), the difference-frequency route dominates and drives a one-way cascade from higher to lower frequencies. We chart the corresponding instability regions ("tongues") and quantify their detuning dependence. The framework provides a simple, quantitative mechanism for energy transfer in black hole ringdowns and clarifies when and how turbulent signatures can arise within linear probes on a weakly perturbed background.

*Kimet Jusufi,Francisco S. N. Lobo,Emmanuel N. Saridakis,Douglas Singleton*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores wormhole geometries created by entangled particles or particle-black hole pairs, using a framework inspired by T-duality. It suggests that these wormholes, supported by gravitational self-energy and quantum gravity effects, naturally emerge without needing exotic matter. The paper classifies these wormholes, examines their properties, identifies the exotic energy at their minimal surfaces, and discusses their implications for ER=EPR and other topics. A summary is provided in the original text. Please note that the abstract has been shortened while preserving the key points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the ER=EPR conjecture, which posits a deep connection between entanglement and the Einstein-Rosen (ER) wormholes. The authors seek to construct a spacetime framework that naturally accommodates these wormholes without resorting to exotic matter, drawing inspiration from T-duality in string theory and quantum gravity effects.

Method: The authors employ a geometric construction method, leveraging T-duality and non-local gravitational self-energy to build wormhole geometries. They use techniques from quantum gravity and general relativity to analyze these structures, focusing on their horizons, throat properties, and embedding characteristics.

Result: The key findings are that entangled particles or pairs source wormhole geometries that require quantum gravity effects rather than exotic matter for their existence. The paper classifies these wormholes, identifies the exotic energy at their throats, and concludes that only a zero-throat geometry is consistent with the ER=EPR principle. This provides a concrete example of ER=EPR within a regular spacetime framework.

Conclusion: The paper advances the ER=EPR conjecture by introducing a spacetime mechanism for entanglement-induced wormholes. It demonstrates the potential for quantum gravity effects to underpin these phenomena, offering new insights into ER, EPR, entanglement, and spacetime structure without relying on exotic matter. The proposed zero-throat geometry offers a promising paradigm for understanding ER=EPR in a regular spacetime setting, with implications for quantum gravity, dark energy, and black hole physics. However, further work is needed to validate these conclusions and explore their broader implications.

Abstract: We construct a class of wormhole geometries supported by the non-local gravitational self-energy that regularizes the particle and black-hole sectors of spacetime. Using this framework, inspired by T-duality, we show that two entangled particles (or particle-black-hole pairs) naturally source an Einstein-Rosen-type geometry in which the required violation of the strong energy condition arises from intrinsic quantum-gravity effects rather than from ad hoc exotic matter, which is matter that violates the null energy condition. We classify the resulting wormholes, analyze their horizons, throat structure and embedding properties, and we identify the exotic energy needed at the minimal surface. Imposing the ER=EPR requirement of non-traversability and the absence of a macroscopic throat, we find that only the zero-throat geometry is compatible with an entanglement-induced Einstein-Rosen bridge, providing a concrete realization of ER=EPR within a fully regular spacetime. Finally, we briefly discuss possible implications for microscopic ER networks from vacuum fluctuations, replica-wormhole interpretations of Hawking radiation, and possible links to entanglement-driven dark-energy scenarios.

TL;DR:  investigated nonlocal gravity models with exponential form factors, focusing on their Newtonian limits, effective sources, and weak-field behavior, providing detailed analyses of potential oscillations and mass functions while verifying solution regularity. Calculated leading logarithmic quantum corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding weak-field solutions in nonlocal gravity models is crucial for exploring their physical implications, such as gravitational potentials and mass functions.

Method: Utilized effective source formalism to compare models, deriving series, integrals, and special functions for effective sources, masses, and potentials. Analyzed the dependence on parameters $N_s$ and $μ_s$, identifying oscillations and positivity of effective masses. Explored quantum corrections through logarithmic terms.

Result: For $N_s > 1$, potentials oscillate; however, effective masses remain positive. Solutions are regular without curvature singularities. Leading quantum corrections to Newtonian potential were determined.

Conclusion: The study elucidates weak-field behavior in nonlocal gravity models, revealing oscillatory potentials and positive masses. Regular solutions and quantum corrections highlight the models' applicability and theoretical consistency.

Abstract: We investigate the Newtonian limit of a class of nonlocal gravity models with exponential form factors $f_s (\Box) = \exp [(-\Box/μ_s^2)^{N_s}]$. Our main goal is to identify similarities and differences between models in this family in regard to weak-field solutions. To this end, we use the effective source formalism to compare the related effective delta sources, mass functions, and Newtonian potentials. We obtain a variety of representations for these quantities in terms of series, integrals, and special functions, as well as simple approximations that capture the relevant dependence on the parameters $N_s$ and $μ_s$ - which can be used to explore the weak-field phenomenology of nonlocal gravity. We explain why only for $N_s>1$ the Newtonian potential oscillates and prove that, despite the oscillations, the effective masses are positive. Moreover, we verify that these linearized solutions are regular (without curvature singularities). Finally, we also calculate the form of the leading logarithmic quantum correction to the Newtonian potential in these models. In all our considerations, we assume that $N_s$ is a positive real parameter. The cases of non-integer $N_s$ might be applied beyond nonlocal gravity, in effective approaches to implement quantum corrections in the weak field regime.

Abstract: We present results from long-term, numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers modeled using both, fully tabulated, finite-temperature, equations of state and their corresponding hybrid representations. The simulations extend up to 150 ms which allows us to assess the role of the treatment of finite-temperature effects on the dynamics of the hypermassive neutron star remnant. Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection. Employing both the Ledoux criterion, necessary condition for the development of convective instabilities, and the Solberg-Høiland criterion, a generalized criterion for axisymmetric perturbations based on a combined analysis of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency and of the epicyclic frequency, we show that differential rotation and thermal stratification in the HMNS give rise to local (yet sustained) convective patterns that persist beyond 100 ms after merger. Those convective patterns, while substantially different between tabulated and hybrid EOS treatments, trigger the the excitation of inertial modes with frequencies smaller than those attained by the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and are potentially within reach of third-generation GW detectors. The late-time excitation of inertial modes, previously reported in studies based on hybrid EOS, is fully supported by the tabulated, finite-temperature EOS simulations presented here, which account for thermal effects in a more consistent way.

Abstract: Extending optical nonlinearity into the extremely weak light regime is at the heart of quantum optics, since it enables the efficient generation of photonic entanglement and implementation of photonic quantum logic gate. Here, we demonstrate the capability for continuously tunable single-photon level nonlinearity, enabled by precise control of Rydberg interaction over two orders of magnitude, through the use of microwave-assisted wave-function engineering. To characterize this nonlinearity, light storage and retrieval protocol utilizing Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency is employed, and the quantum statistics of the retrieved photons are analyzed. As a first application, we demonstrate our protocol can speed up the preparation of single photons in low-lying Rydberg states by a factor of up to ~ 40. Our work holds the potential to accelerate quantum operations and to improve the circuit depth and connectivity in Rydberg systems, representing a crucial step towards scalable quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: A theoretical study was conducted on the impact of electron and positron impact ionization of excited hydrogen atoms that were in the 3s state; this study was conducted within the First-Born Approximation (FBA), which provides an analytical expression for the transition matrix in terms of the Bethe-Lewis Integral Formalism. This formalism utilized both Coulomb continuum and confluent hypergeometric functions to describe the scattering states involved. Single Differential Cross Sections (SDCS) were calculated for incident energies of 100, 150, 200, and 250 eV. The data obtained indicated a peak in the ionization rates approximately at 200 eV, with the ionization rate decreasing as the incident energy increased further. The diffuse radial nature of the 3s wave function is shown to increase the sensitivity of the ionization dynamics to the incident particle energy. Asymmetries in charge were also detected; specifically, at low energy of the ejected electron, the SDCS values for positrons were greater than the corresponding values for electrons; however, as the energy of the incident particles was increased, these differences disappeared, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the FBA at high energy limits. The residual differences at low energy were due to the omission of exchange and post-collision interactions from the model. The results of this work can be used as benchmarking for the development of more complex distorted wave and multi-scattering theories in excited state ionization processes.

Abstract: Chip-scale microwave atomic systems based on thermal atomic beams offer a promising approach to realize low-power and low-drift clocks for timing holdover applications. Miniature beam clocks are expected to suppress many of the shifts that commonly limit existing chip-scale atomic clocks based on coherent population trapping, including collisional shifts and some light shifts. However, the beam geometry can amplify some challenges such as Doppler shifts, which generate a strong sensitivity to laser frequency variation. Using a cm-scale 87Rb atom beam clock, we identify a surprisingly strong competition between Doppler shifts and resonant light shifts arising from asymmetric decay in the clock spectroscopy Λ-system. Leveraging this competition between Doppler and resonant light shifts, we demonstrate clock operation at specific, convenient experimental parameters consistent with zero sensitivity to laser frequency variation and white-noise-limited clock frequency averaging for 1000 s of integration.

Abstract: We study spin-phonon coupled dynamics in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection created by laser coupling the electronic (spin) and vibrational degrees of freedom of a pair of trapped Rydberg ions. We show that the shape of the potential energy surfaces can be engineered and controlled by exploiting the sideband transitions of the crystal vibration and dipole-dipole interactions between Rydberg ions in the Lamb-Dicke regime. Using the sideband transition, we realize a sloped conical intersection whose cone axis is only tilted along one spatial axis. When the phonon wavepacket is located in the potential minimum of the lower potential surface, the spin and phonon dynamics are largely frozen owing to the geometric phase effect. When starting from the upper potential surface, the electronic and phonon states tunnel to the lower potential surface, leading to a partial revival of the initial state. In contrast, the dynamics drastically change when the initial wavepackets are away from the conical intersection. The initial state is revived, and is almost entirely irrelevant to whether it is from the lower or upper potential surface. Complete Rabi oscillations of the adiabatic states are found when the wavepacket is initialized on the upper potential surface. The dynamics occur on the microsecond and nanometer scales, implying that Rydberg ions provide a platform for simulating nonadiabatic processes in the vicinity of a sloped conical intersection.

Abstract: Quantum transduction, which enables the coherent conversion of quantum information between disparate physical platforms, is a cornerstone for realizing scalable and interoperable quantum networks. Among various approaches, parametric frequency mixing processes such as four-wave mixing (FWM) offer a promising pathway toward efficient and low-noise transduction. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of coherent quantum state transfer by indirectly verifying high-fidelity wavefunction's phase mapping (>99%) from the input field to the generated output field wave. Using a gas-filled hollow-core capillary fiber, we systematically investigate spectral phase evolution across a broad range, including infrared (IR) to ultraviolet (UV) transitions, as well as conversions from telecom-band (1550 nm) to visible (516 nm) and deep-UV (308 nm) wavelengths. Our results reveal that strong phase coherence can be maintained throughout these diverse conversion regimes. Because quantum properties such as coherence and entanglement are intrinsically encoded in both the amplitude and phase of a photonic wavefunction, preserving spectral phase is essential for faithful quantum information transfer. We further show that efficient and phase-preserving transduction can be achieved by tuning system parameters, offering valuable insights into nonlinear coupling dynamics. These findings establish a promising foundation for advancing FWM-based quantum transduction schemes and open new avenues for integrating heterogeneous quantum systems across wide spectral domains within future quantum communication networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The paper addresses a key limitation in Raman microscopy: the inability to detect low-concentration biomolecules due to photon damage. By leveraging cavity-enhancement, the authors aim to enhance sensitivity while avoiding photochemical damage.

Method:  The authors developed a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope. They used fiber-optic cavities to enhance nonlinear signal, likely improving sensitivity and reducing quantum noise.

Result:  Results show up to an 8.3 dB improvement in spectroscopy and 8.6 dB in cell imaging, very close to quantum noise limits.

Conclusion:  cavity-enhanced SRS microscopy can overcome detection limits set by photon damage, surpassing quantum noise in microscopy limits.

Abstract: Nonlinear optical processes are used in biological microscopy to surpass the diffraction limit on resolution, image deeper into brain tissues, and identify biomolecules without exogenous labels. These techniques typically require high optical intensities to increase the strength of the nonlinear interactions, which can perturb native biochemistry and damage or kill living samples. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy visualizes the spatial distribution of molecules using a nonlinear interaction between light and chemically specific molecular vibrations. However, the detection of biomolecules at low concentrations is limited by the total photon dose that can be applied before photodamage alters the sample, and photon shot noise sets the minimum achievable noise floor for most microscopes. Here we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced SRS microscope that is more sensitive than an equivalent conventional SRS microscope by up to 8.3(7) dB in spectroscopy and 8.6(1) dB in cell imaging. These results approach quantum limits on sensitivity and demonstrate that quantum states of light are sufficient but not necessary to enhance the sensitivity of microscopy techniques that are limited by photodamage.

Abstract: Detecting concealed chemicals and explosives remains a critical challenge in global security. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) offers a promising non-invasive and stand-off detection technique owing to its ability to penetrate optically opaque materials without causing ionization damage. While many chemicals exhibit distinct spectral features in the terahertz range, conventional terahertz-based detection methods often struggle in real-world environments, where variations in sample geometry, thickness, and packaging can lead to inconsistent spectral responses. In this study, we present a chemical imaging system that integrates THz-TDS with deep learning to enable accurate pixel-level identification and classification of different explosives. Operating in reflection mode and enhanced with plasmonic nanoantenna arrays, our THz-TDS system achieves a peak dynamic range of 96 dB and a detection bandwidth of 4.5 THz, supporting practical, stand-off operation. By analyzing individual time-domain pulses with deep neural networks, the system exhibits strong resilience to environmental variations and sample inconsistencies. Blind testing across eight chemicals, including pharmaceutical excipients and explosive compounds, resulted in an average classification accuracy of 99.42% at the pixel level. Notably, the system maintained an average accuracy of 88.83% when detecting explosives concealed under opaque paper coverings, demonstrating its robust generalization capability. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced terahertz spectroscopy with neural networks for highly sensitive and specific chemical and explosive detection in diverse and operationally relevant scenarios.

TL;DR: Adaptive optics is used for interferometer-based spectroscopy without moving parts. A Michelson interferometer with an SLM is employed to study narrow-band light sources. The research shows that fringes experience wavelength shifts, enabling fast single-snapshot spectroscopy with a time-varying phase profile for better performance. The setup opens possibilities for hyperspectral imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectroscopy is vital in various scientific and industrial applications, but traditional methods can be limited by moving parts or complexity. Adaptive optics offer a way to simplify these systems while maintaining accuracy.

Method: A Michelson Interferometer is combined with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). The SLM is used to provide a constant phase profile, but wavelength shifts are observed despite this. The method involves calibrating these shifts by measuring the incident spectrum across the fringe pattern, leading to the 'teardrop' shape of the spectral peak. The setup also varies the phase profile to achieve fast single-snapshot or multi-step spectroscopy.

Result: The research shows that λ shifts in fringes can enable spectroscopy. With a time-varying phase profile, multi-step spectroscopy is achieved, improving noise levels, resolution, and contrast. The Michelson Interferometer setup is adaptable for hyperspectral imaging within spectral ranges.

Conclusion: Adaptive optics provide a simplified yet effective method for spectroscopy based on interferometers, opening wide applications for hyperspectral imaging.

Abstract: Adaptive optics enables the deployment of interferometer-based spectroscopy without the need for moving parts necessary for scanning the interferometer arms. Here, we employ a Michelson Interferometer in conjunction with a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for determining the spectral profile of a narrow-band light source. Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast. Our findings establish that the Michelson Interferometer can be used to perform spectroscopy of any source within a certain spectral range from simple images of the fringe pattern, so as to facilitate exciting applications towards hyperspectral imaging.

Abstract: In coherent optical communication across turbulent atmospheric channels, reference beacons can be multiplexed with information-encoded signals during transmission. In this case, it is commonly assumed that the wavefront distortion of the two is equivalent. In contrast to this assumption, we present experimental evidence of relative wavefront errors (WFEs) between polarization-multiplexed reference beacons and signals, after passing through a 2.4 km atmospheric link. We develop machine learning-based wavefront correction algorithms to compensate for observed WFEs, via phase retrieval, resulting in up to a 2/3 reduction in the relative phase error variance. Further, we analyze the excess noise contributions from relative WFEs in the context of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), where our findings suggest that if future CV-QKD implementations employ wavefront correction algorithms similar to those reported here, an order of magnitude increase in secure key rates may be forthcoming.

TL;DR: Sub-cycle laser pulses provide precise temporal control of holographic interference in intracycle interference patterns, with duration, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and temporal envelope significantly affecting the patterns observed. The analysis reveals how altering these parameters can selectively enhance or suppress specific interference features, offering new opportunities for studying attosecond electron dynamics.  


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the influence of sub-cycle laser pulses on intracycle interference patterns is crucial for advancing our knowledge of attosecond electron dynamics and improving ultrafast control techniques in quantum phenomena.  

Method: The research employs time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) simulations combined with classical trajectory calculations to analyze the photoelectron momentum distributions of helium. This dual approach allows for a detailed examination of how sub-cycle pulses affect the interference patterns.  

Result: The study identifies that sub-cycle pulses with specific CEP values (0° and 90°) can enhance or suppress holographic interference features, such as forward-scattering (FSH), backward-scattering (BSH), and time double-slit (TDS) patterns. Additionally, classical analysis shows that the intrinsic chirp in sub-cycle fields influences the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby affecting fringe spacing. Pulse envelope variations also modify fringe spacings by altering the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times.  

Conclusion: Sub-cycle laser pulses provide a powerful tool for controlling and manipulating holographic interference patterns, enabling detailed studies of attosecond electron dynamics and offering new possibilities for ultrafast control of quantum systems.  

Abstract: We investigate the influence of sub-cycle laser pulses on holographic and non-holographic intracycle interferences by analyzing the photoelectron momentum distributions of helium using TDSE simulations supported by classical trajectory calculations. The results show that the forward-scattering holographic (FSH), backward-scattering holographic (BSH), and time double-slit (TDS) structures are found to be highly sensitive to the pulse duration, carrier-envelope phase (CEP), and temporal envelope in the sub-cycle regime. Sub-cycle pulses with CEP values of $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ selectively enhance or suppress distinct features, isolating holographic patterns and enhancing BSH fringes. Classical analysis reveals that the intrinsic chirp inherent to sub-cycle fields shortens the recollision time for scattering trajectories, thereby increasing the fringe spacing in FSH and BSH patterns, while simultaneously enlarging the ATI peak spacing associated with TDS interference. Pulse envelope variations, even at fixed FWHM duration, further reshape the fringe spacings by modifying the instantaneous frequency and vector potential slope near ionization times. These results demonstrate that sub-cycle pulses enable precise temporal control of holographic interference, offering new opportunities for probing and manipulating attosecond electron dynamics.

Abstract: In modern artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a cornerstone for visual and perceptual tasks. However, their implementation on conventional electronic hardware faces fundamental bottlenecks in speed and energy efficiency due to resistive and capacitive losses. Photonic alternatives offer a promising route, yet the difficulty of realizing optical nonlinearities has prevented the realization of all-optical CNNs capable of end-to-end image classification. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical CNN that bypasses the need for explicit optical nonlinear activations. Our architecture comprises a single spatial-differentiation convolutional stage--using 24 directional kernels spanning 360°, along with a mean-filtering kernel--followed by a diffractive fully-connected layer. The directional convolution enhances feature selectivity, suppresses noise and crosstalk, and simplifies the classification task, allowing the weak nonlinearity inherent in optical diffraction to achieve high accuracy. We report experimentally classification accuracies of 86.8% on handwritten digits (MNIST) and 94.8% on a ten-class gesture dataset. The system delivers a computational throughput of 1.13X10^5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and an energy efficiency of 1.51X10^3 TOPS/W--the highest reported among CNN hardware--with the potential to improve by a further 5-6 orders of magnitude using nanosecond-scale detectors. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultralow-latency, ultralow-energy vision processing for real-time intelligent systems.

We demonstrate a 2D array of gold nanodiscs designed to host a hybrid resonance of localized plasmon and surface lattice modes. The structure exhibits a Verdet constant of 1.98e6 deg/T.m, corresponding to a Faraday rotation of -0.15 deg at a 1 T magnetic field. This Verdet constant represents a 15-fold enhancement over unpatterned gold and is highly competitive with many plasmon-enhanced diamagnetic nanostructures. These findings offer new opportunities for harnessing strong magneto-plasmonic effects in optoelectronic devices by patterning common non-magnetic metals.

Motivation: The ability to multiplex and demultiplex light signals in multimode fibers is crucial for future optical networks. Existing methods are limited by size, complexity, and flexibility.

Method: The authors developed a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN) that enables high-mode isolation and speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes. The DNN is fabricated using two-photon nanolithography and achieves 80% demultiplexing accuracy.

Result: The DNN-based demultiplexer is compact (120μm × 120μm × 80μm) and outperforms previous digital-optical solutions in terms of accuracy and flexibility.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for building compact, low-latency optical processors for high-performance fiber optic networks.

Abstract: In today's information age, advanced fiber optic transmission technology is of paramount importance. Multimode fibers (MMFs) using space-division multiplexing (SDM) are promising for improved transmission capacity, connection flexibility, and security of data. However, the complex transmission characteristics of MMFs significantly hinder precise mode demultiplexing. Conventional approaches, including holographic measurements, phase retrieval algorithms, photonic lanterns, and multiplane light conversion, are limited by system complexity, size, and flexibility. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time a purely optical, chip-scale AI solution for high-mode isolation, speed-of-light demultiplexing of MMF modes using a three-dimensional diffractive neural network (DNN). The DNN is trained with synthetic modal data and fabricated using two-photon nanolithography. It features a compact size of $120μm \times 120μm \times 80μm$ and a diffractive structure size of $1μm^{2}$ for the neurons at the hidden layers of the network. Experimentally, the DNN demultiplexer achieves a relative demultiplexing accuracy of over 80%. The AI approach of DNN allows for flexible design and overcomes the size and performance limitations of digital-optical demultiplexers. This work paves the way for compact, low-latency optical processors for high-performance demultiplexers and enables scalable, chip-integrated solutions for next-generation fiber optic networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Hard X-ray and THz imaging has become a key technology in material characterization, requiring high-resolution imaging in the THz range.

Method: We developed a THz Fourier ptychographic imaging system using a motorized kinematic mirror to capture multi-angle plane-wave illuminations, followed by aberration-corrected iterative phase-retrieval algorithm combined with an illumination calibration scheme for effective numerical aperture expansion.

Result: High-resolution amplitude and phase THz imaging is achieved without extensive hardware changes, enabling applications in complex media and non-destructive testing.

Conclusion: This framework provides a new approach for high-resolution THz imaging with potential applications in various fields.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging in the terahertz (THz) spectral range remains fundamentally constrained by the limited numerical apertures of currently existing state-of-the-art imagers, which restricts its applicability across many fields, such as imaging in complex media or nondestructive testing. To address this challenge, we introduce a proof-of-concept implementation of THz Fourier Ptychographic imaging to enhance spatial resolution without requiring extensive hardware modifications. Our method employs a motorized kinematic mirror to generate a sequence of controlled, multi-angle plane-wave illuminations, with each resulting oblique-illumination intensity image encoding a limited portion of the spatial-frequency content of the target imaging sample. These measurements are combined in the Fourier domain using an aberration-corrected iterative phase-retrieval algorithm integrated with an efficient illumination calibration scheme, which enables the reconstruction of resolution-enhanced amplitude and phase images through the synthetic expansion of the effective numerical aperture. Our work establishes a robust framework for high-resolution THz imaging and paves the way for a wide array of applications in materials characterization, spectroscopy, and non-destructive evaluation.

TL;DR: Network geometries influence emission spectra in photonic devices, but specific factors and their roles remain unclear.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how network geometry affects emission is crucial for designing photonic devices like random lasers and photonics processors.

Method: Utilized SALT equations to statistically analyze the relationships between network geometry and emission spectrum.

Result: Edge crowding impacts modal intensity distribution uniformity, essential for emission uniformity in photonic devices.

Conclusion: Statistical analysis bridges geometry and emission, aiding in designing photonic systems.

Abstract: Optically active networks show feature-rich emission that depends on the fine details of their geometry, and find diverse applications in random lasers, sensing devices and photonics processors. In these and other systems, a thorough and predictive characterization of how the network geometry correlates with the resulting emission spectrum would be highly important, however such outright description is still lacking. In this work, we take a step toward filling this gap, by using the well-known Steady-State ab Initio Laser Theory (SALT) equations [L. Ge et al., Phys. Rev. A 82, 063824 (2010)] to carry out an extensive set of statistical analyses and establish connections between the random network geometry and their ultimate emission spectrum. Our results show that edge crowding is key to tune the uniformity of the modal intensity distribution of the emission spectrum. A statistical framework for the comprehensive understanding of the network statistical properties is highly significant to establish precise design rules for network-based photonic devices and intelligent systems.

Abstract: Waveguide crossings represent one of the most critical components in very-large-scale photonic integration (VLSPI). Three-dimensional waveguide crossings, which distribute optical pathways across multiple planes, can achieve near-zero crosstalk and extremely low crossing-induced loss. However, they face an intrinsic trade-off between interlayer crossing performance and coupling efficiency. To address this challenge, we developed a low-cost fabrication method for 3D waveguide crossings by exploiting the edge rounding effect inherent to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Using this method, we demonstrate waveguide crossings with average loss below 0.002 dB and crosstalk below -62 dB on Ta2O5-on-LNOI integrated photonic platform. Our method maintains full compatibility with conventional semiconductor manufacturing technology and paves the way for realizing VLSPI on the thin-film lithium niobate platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum cascade laser performance is important for spectroscopy applications that require broad tunability and narrow linewidth.

Method: They modified a Fabry-Perot Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) by adding an external-cavity configuration using a diffraction grating.

Result: The setup enabled single-mode emission across 4.29-4.44 µm, enhanced threshold current and power, and reduced noise.

Conclusion: EC-QCLs are promising for spectroscopy with their tunability and reduced noise.

Abstract: Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are semiconductor-heterostructure devices known for their emission in the mid-infrared and THz spectral regions. Due to their operating regime, their intrinsic linewidth is significantly narrower compared to bipolar semiconductor lasers. Here, we demonstrate that by implementing an external-cavity (EC) configuration based on a commercial diffraction grating, we have successfully induced a Fabry-Perot QCL to emit on a single mode with a broadly-tunable wavelength in the range 4.29-4.44 μm. This very simple setup enhances the laser's performance in terms of threshold current and emitted power. We further prove that the EC configuration positively impacts the laser's noise properties. In particular, the intrinsic linewidth is substantially reduced, the full linewidth is also decreased (depending on the integration timescale), and the relative intensity noise is slightly reduced. These characteristics, which hold within the whole tuning range, make the EC-QCL a good candidate for spectroscopy applications where broad tunability and narrow linewidth are highly demanded.

TL;DR: A novel millimeter-wave baseband comb source with 50 GHz repetition rate and metrological grade is developed using optical microcomb and soliton source technology, enabling ultra-low phase noise and versatile applications in communications and sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of wireless communications, precision sensing, and positioning systems requires millimeter-wave baseband comb sources with high stability and scalability. This paper addresses the gap by introducing a new technology combining optical microcombs and soliton sources, potentially revolutionizing these fields by offering superior performance.

Method: The researchers utilized an optical microcomb to generate a high repetition rate signal and combined it with a soliton source to create a baseband comb. They employed photoconductive antennas for coherent downconversion and utilized the unique properties of optical solitons for zero-carrier envelope offset operation, ensuring high phase coherence and stability.

Result: The developed comb source operates at 50 GHz with a repetition rate of 50 GHz, providing a stable and highly coherent signal spanning subterahertz regions. It supports direct time-domain spectroscopy without pulse temporal alignment, demonstrating significant path differences that maintain operation even in free-running conditions. The multisoliton operation further enhances flexibility by allowing spectral adjustments through different soliton states.

Conclusion: This breakthrough in millimeter-wave baseband comb technology offers a robust solution for next-gen systems, combining high performance with scalability and versatility, paving the way for improved capabilities in communications, sensing, and positioning.

Abstract: Metrological-grade millimetre wave baseband comb sources covering the subterahertz window are a key building block for next-generation wireless communications, precision sensing, and positioning systems. While optical microcombs have set new benchmarks in ultra-low phase noise single-frequency microwave generation, to date, no microcomb source has directly produced a millimetre-wave baseband comb. Here, we present a 50 GHz repetition rate carrier-envelope offset estabilised millimetre-wave baseband comb source covering the sub-terahertz region, generated from an optical microcomb source. Our microresonator-filtered microcomb enables direct, coherent downconversion via photoconductive antennas, even without external amplification. The metrological-grade optical soliton source produces single-cycle, naturally zero carrier-envelope offset millimetrewave baseband combs. It supports time-domain spectroscopy without any need to temporally align the source and detection pulses, as the ultra-high phase coherence allows significant differences between the optical paths of the source and detection pulses, which we tested over 8m, finding no degradation even in freerunning operation. Finally, the multisoliton operation regime provides a simple way of spectrally tailoring the microwave output by selecting different optical soliton states.

Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying γ-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.

Abstract: Metamaterials with tunable optical properties provide a versatile platform for controlling electromagnetic interactions at the nanoscale. This study explores the anisotropic thermal behavior of metamaterials composed of planar plates perforated with periodic arrays of cylinders possessing elliptical cross sections. In contrast to conventional circular perforations, elliptical geometries inherently break rotational symmetry, introducing anisotropy in the effective electromagnetic and thermal response of the structure. Using a fluctuation electrodynamics framework combined with full-wave numerical simulations, we quantify the near-field radiative heat transfer between such elliptically perforated plates as a function of ellipse orientation, aspect ratio, and separation distance. The results reveal that elliptical perforations enable enhanced spectral and directional control of evanescent mode coupling and surface polariton excitation, leading to significant modulation of the near-field heat flux. These findings highlight the potential of geometrically engineered anisotropy for advanced thermal management and energy conversion applications, and offer new design strategies for the development of thermally functional metamaterials operating in the near-field regime.

Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons in optical microresonators have emerged as a powerful tool for compact and coherent frequency comb generation. Advances in nanofabrication have allowed precise dispersion engineering, unlocking octave-spanning soliton combs that are essential for applications such as optical atomic clocks, frequency synthesis, precision spectroscopy, and astronomical spectrometer calibration. However, a key challenge hindering their practical deployment is the intrinsic bandwidth-efficiency trade-off: achieving broadband soliton generation requires large pump detuning, which suppresses power coupling and limits pump-to-comb conversion efficiencies to only a few percent. Recent efforts using pulsed pumping or coupled-resonator architectures have improved efficiency to several tens of percent, yet their bandwidths remain below one-tenth of an octave, inadequate for applications demanding wide spectral coverage. Here, we overcome this limitation by harnessing mode interactions between spatial modes within a single microresonator. The mode hybridization creates an additional power-transfer channel that supports large pump detuning while maintaining strong pump-to-resonator coupling, enabling broadband soliton formation at substantially reduced pump power. Using this approach, we demonstrate an octave-spanning soliton microcomb with a record pump-to-comb conversion efficiency exceeding 50%. These results resolve the fundamental bandwidth-efficiency dilemma in soliton microcombs and paves the way toward fully-integrated, high-efficiency, ultrabroad comb sources for next-generation photonic systems.
