The theory can be understood as a formal framework that\nencompasses existing semiclassical methods: instanton theory and semiclassical\ntransition state theory (SCTST). Unlike SCTST, the present formalism does not\nstart from the concept of \"good\" action-angle variables. Instead, it is based\non a conjectured connection between the cumulative reaction probability and the\ninstanton contribution to the formally exact generalisation of Gutzwiller's\nformula for the trace of the Green's function. The formalism effectively\ngeneralises the \"imaginary free-energy\" formulation of instanton theory to\nmicrocanonical scattering rates and all orders in $\\hbar$. In one dimension,\nexplicit expressions are derived for the generalised reduced action up to\n$O(\\hbar^4)$ using exact WKB/quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The connection\nbetween the present formalism and the standard second order vibrational\nperturbation theory (VPT2) version of SCTST is explored. It is also shown that\nthe standard thermal instanton rate theory, as well as higher order (dividing\nsurface independent) \"perturbative\" corrections can be straightforwardly\nderived from the framework. Above the crossover temperature, first-order\ncorrections in $\\hbar$ to the parabolic barrier (\"sphaleron\") rate are also\nderived. A simple anharmonic transition state theory and anharmonic version of\nthe Wigner tunneling correction are presented. Finally, the potential for the\ndevelopment of new and improved semiclassical methods for modelling reaction\nkinetics is discussed."}

The first\nexperiment involved fabricating centimeter-scale polymer lenses, solidifying\nthem via ultraviolet (UV) curing, and analyzing the resultant optics upon their\nreturn to Earth. While sub-nanometric surface smoothness was achieved, some\npolymer lenses displayed unexpected thermo-chemical deformations, indicating\ncomplex polymerization dynamics unique to the microgravity environment. In the\nsecond experiment, a large-scale, 172 mm diameter water lens was deployed,\nconfirming Fluidic Shaping's scalability and demonstrating basic optical\nfunctionality through image analysis. These experiments collectively underline\nthe technique's relevance for both small-scale optics and large-aperture\napplications. Our results highlight critical considerations for future\nresearch, including optimizing polymerization processes and refining\nliquid-handling methods to advance practical, in-space optical manufacturing\ncapabilities."}

We present an extension of the\nFlexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves\n(GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of\nGR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN)\ncoefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time-\nand frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying\npotential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing\nformula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian\napproaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on\ndeviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most\nrecent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW\nphases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter\nspace with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\\odot}$, the optimal regime for\ntesting deviations is not known a priori.

Here we report on the\nrealization of a relatively long ultra-stable silicon cavity with a length of\n10 cm and sub-5-K operating temperatures. We devise a dynamical protocol of\ncool-quiet quench measurement that reveals the inherent $10^{-17}$-level\nfrequency instability of the silicon cavity despite the substantially larger\nfrequency noise induced by the cryostat vibration. We further develop a method\nfor suppressing the cryostat-vibration-induced frequency noise under continuous\ncooling, and observe an average frequency instability of $4.3(2) \\times\n10^{-17}$ for averaging times of 4 to 12 seconds. Using the measured noise\npower spectral density, we compute a median linewidth of 9.6(3) mHz for the\nsilicon cavity laser at 1397 nm, which is supported by an empirically\ndetermined linewidth of 5.7(3) mHz based on direct optical beat measurements.\nThese results establish a new record for optical cavities within a closed-cycle\ncryocooler at sub-5-K temperatures and provide a prototypical system for using\nlong cryogenic cavities to enhance frequency stabilities to the low-$10^{-17}$\nor better level."}

Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel\nskyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic\ntorques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter\nregion with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on\nintrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing\ndamping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies\nsystematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and\nuniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of\nmaterial parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while\nthe Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This\ncomprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design\nframework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic\nsystems."}

The geodesic equations for the BF family are\nthus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class,\nwe explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass\ndistinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By\nrequiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity,\nwe demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF\nfamily, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the\npresent algorithm to ${\\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic\ngeneralization of the Chong-Cveti\\v{c}-L\\\"u-Pope rotating black hole solution,\nby taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar\ngravity.

Both the\nemission spectrum and transmission remained nearly unchanged,even at high\ndoping levels. The reduction in light yield was moderate, with approximately\n8,400 photons emitted for a 1 MeV energy deposition by an electron at 1$\\%$\ntellurium loading. The time profile of the light emission induced by alpha\nparticles was also investigated, revealing that the scintillation response\nbecomes significantly faster with increasing tellurium concentration."}

However, a general theoretical framework to\nanalyze this approach has been lacking.\n  In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous\nmeasurements. Given a family of states\n$\\{\\,|\\psi_x\\rangle\\,\\}_{x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist\nmeasurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about\n$x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally\narises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal\nnumber of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear\nprogram, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In\nparticular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence\nof fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results\nshowing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach\nof arXiv:2310.20651. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for\nthe Quantum Decoding Problem."}

Testing bosonic quantum states", "comment": "47 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of\ncontinuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical\nsystems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a\nfundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we\nefficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the\nperspective of representation theory and quantum learning theory,\ncharacterizing the sample complexity of Gaussianity testing as a function of\nthe number of modes. For pure states, we prove that just a constant number of\ncopies is sufficient to decide whether the state is exactly Gaussian. We then\nextend this to the tolerant setting, showing that a polynomial number of copies\nsuffices to distinguish states that are close to Gaussian from those that are\nfar. In contrast, we establish that testing Gaussianity of general mixed states\nnecessarily requires exponentially many copies, thereby identifying a\nfundamental limitation in testing CV systems. Our approach relies on\nrotation-invariant symmetries of Gaussian states together with the recently\nintroduced toolbox of CV trace-distance bounds."}

Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under\nsuitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can\nconverge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black\nholes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do\nnot converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit\nlarge $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to\nconvergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial\ncommutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby\nuniverse."}

In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted\nlocality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices,\nwhich provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary\nsymmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation\nsymmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted\nlocality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its\nanomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the\nsubscript $\\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by\ncomplex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple\nLieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous\nsymmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement\narea law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an\nanomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that\nhas an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state,\nas long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range\nof the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions,\nthe last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$\nis the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general\ntheorems in various concrete examples."}
