Many figures. Comments welcome", "summary": "Understanding how complex quantum systems emulate randomness is central to\nquantum chaos, thermalization, and information theory. In one setting,\nout-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe\nasymptotic freeness between Heisenberg operators: the non-commutative\ngeneralization of statistical independence. In a distinct research direction,\nthe concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions\nof unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging\nthese two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a\nrandom matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only\npolynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of\nhigher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the\nobservables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems\naccording to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble\nprovably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for\naverage OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further\ncompute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing\nconvergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that\nfreeness is also reached on-average for global observables.

Of particular interest are phase-change oxides,\nwhich allow for control over the metal-to-insulator transition. Here, we report\nX-ray nano-diffraction structural imaging of micro-devices fabricated with the\narchetypal phase-change material vanadium sesquioxide (V$_2$O$_3$). The devices\ncontain a Ga ion-irradiated region where the metal-to-insulator transition\ncritical temperature is lowered, a useful feature for controlling neuron-like\nspiking behavior. Results show that strain, induced by crystal lattice mismatch\nbetween the pristine and irradiated material, leads to a suppression of the\nmetal-to-insulator-transition. Suppression occurs within the irradiated region\nor along its edges, depending on the defect-distribution and the size of the\nregion. The observed self-straining effect could extend to other phase-change\noxides and dominate as device dimensions are reduced and become too small to\ndissipate strain within the irradiated region. The findings are important for\nphase engineering in phase-change devices and highlight the necessity to study\nphase transitions at the nanoscale.", "AI": {"tldr":

We then explicitly\ncalculate the amount of information of the qudit contained in an interval of\nlength $2\\ell$ (centered around $p$) at some later time $t=T$. We find that at\nstrong coupling, this quantity shows a sharp transition as a function of $\\ell$\nfrom near zero to near maximal correlation. The transition occurs at $\\ell \\sim\nv_B T$, with $v_B$ being the butterfly velocity. Underlying the emergence of\nthis sharp light-cone is a non-linear generalization of the diffusion equation\ncalled the FKPP equation, which admits sharp domain wall solutions at late\ntimes and strong coupling. These domain wall solutions can be understood on\nphysical grounds from properties of operator growth in chaotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the spread of quantum information in a one-dimensional Brownian SYK chain and finds a sharp light-cone with an information transition at the butterfly velocity.

The results suggest that quantum chaos and operator scrambling are key to understanding information propagation in holographic theories. The non-linear diffusion model offers a new angle for studying quantum error correction in chaotic systems."}}

The design\nconsists of a two-stage concave-convex pair, where optical aberrations are\ncancelled within each stage and between them, in a manner similar to that of a\ndouble-Gauss lens. The light rays pass through the central aperture in each\nmirror with acceptable obscuration. The numerical aperture (NA) is 0.5 and 0.7\nfor Hyper-NA. It has a circular exposure field with a diameter of 26 mm. The\nresidual radial distortion is rather high at a few microns at the field rim,\nand the scan motion causes image blurring. Thus, we need to revert to the\nstepper design, and the field becomes smaller, i.e. 18 mm x 18 mm square.\nHowever, this brings an important benefit: we can remove the scanning mechanism\nfrom the photomask side. It is important to note that both the wafer and the\nphotomask remain stationary during the EUV exposure. This guarantees superior\noverlay control and results in enhanced productivity.

The breakdown of these effective\nmodels, built on assumptions such as ensemble spectral homogeneity, an\nunstructured photonic density of states, and weak light-matter coupling, has\nalso recently attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigate the\naccuracy of this well-established framework beyond the most conventional, and\nextensively explored, spontaneous emission configuration. Specifically, we\nconsider a system comprising two coherently driven and detuned quantum\nemitters, embedded within a hybrid photonic-plasmonic cavity, formed by a\nmetallic nanorod integrated into a high-refractive-index dielectric\nmicroresonator.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to WSMs, but are\nalso shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled\nnoncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the\norigin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal\nproperty. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in\nSOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and\nmomentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic\nand magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the\nchiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic\nquadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for\nboth types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to\nenhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal,\nbut does not affect its qualitative behavior.

In the present work we relax\nthe convexity condition in two respects. Firstly (cf. Theorem 1) we admit\n$2$-convex extrinsic curvatures, (for which the sum of the lowest two\neigenvalues is non-negative) which allows for the following further\npossibility: Either $V$ or some finite cover $\\tilde V$ are surface bundles\nover the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Secondly, (cf. Theorem 2) if\n$(V,g,{K})$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector\n$\\xi$, we can further relax the convexity requirement in terms of the\ndecomposition of ${K}$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal\nto $\\xi$. Compared to Theorem 1, this yields more specific information on the\npossible foliations of $V$, depending on whether the isometry is tangent to the\nbase or to the fibers. Moreover, in the special cases that $V$ is either\nnon-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing\nsecond homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing\nto covers.

At\nleast parts of these accretion disks consist of a plasma in which light rays\nwith different energies are dispersed. However, we usually do not know the\nexact configurations of these plasmas. In this paper we will now use the\nexample of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an inhomogeneous pressureless\nand nonmagnetised plasma to investigate how the structural changes of the\nphoton rings can help us to determine the properties of a plasma surrounding a\nblack hole using multifrequency observations. For this purpose we will use a\nsimple analytic model which describes a plasma whose electron density increases\ntowards the equatorial plane when we approach the event horizon. For the chosen\nmodel we will first derive and then analytically solve the equations of motion.\nThen we will place an observer in the domain of outer communication and\nintroduce an orthonormal tetrad to relate the constants of motion to\nlatitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere. In the next\nstep we will use the analytic solutions to investigate the geometric structures\nof the direct image as well as the photon rings of first and second order on\nthe observer's celestial sphere.

These attributes enable high\nresolution sensing of magnetic fields, strain, and temperature at the\nnanoscale. In this Perspective, we review recent progress in quantum sensing\nusing spin defects in hBN, including the widely studied boron vacancy (VB-) and\nemerging carbon related single spin centers. We summarize protocols for spin\ninitialization, coherent manipulation, and optical readout, and highlight\ndemonstrated applications in hybrid architectures and extreme environments and\ndiscuss advances in deterministic defect engineering, coherence preservation at\nthe 2D limit. Finally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in\nrealizing scalable, robust, and multifunctional quantum sensors based on 2D\nmaterials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4BN\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7b49\u7684\u6d4b\u611f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u7597\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6 VB- \u548c\u78b3\u76f8\u5173\u5355\u81ea\u65cb\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684Initialization\u3001Coherent Manipulation\u548cOptical Readout protocol\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u5176\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u5982 hBN \u7684\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f3a\u9677\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u611f\u5230\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u5df2\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u505c\u8f66."}}

While light is a hyper\nefficient information carrier, intrinsically weak light interactions make\ndirect information processing difficult to implement. Recently, specialized\nnonlinear photonics have opened new controls over light fields with\nextraordinary bandwidth, coherence, and the emergence of strong interactions\namong nonlinear eigenstates like solitons. We harness an ensemble of hundreds\nof Kerr-nonlinear microresonator solitons and implement an analog feedback\nnetwork to create an Ising machine with fully programmable all-to-all\ninteractions. By increasing the feedback for self, on-diagonal interactions,\neach soliton exhibits a universal spin-like bifurcation. Using this palette of\ninteractions amongst the entire soliton ensemble, we encode the Ising machine\nto solve the benchmark Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The combination of\nuniform soliton interactions and the compatibility of our Ising machine with\nhigh-speed data interconnects enables rapid and precise solutions of complex\nSAT problems.

Here, $t$\nrepresents the maximum execution time for each circuit layer.

Traditionally, this capability is measured\nby the entangling power (EP), defined as the average entanglement generated\nwhen a quantum operation acts uniformly on all possible product states.\nHowever, EP alone cannot capture the intricate input-state-dependent nature of\nentanglement generation. To address this, we define a complementary metric --\nentangling power deviation (EPD) -- as the standard deviation of entanglement\ngenerated over all product input states, thereby capturing the multifaceted\nnature of entangling behavior. We develop a general group-theoretical framework\nthat yields closed-form expressions for both EP and EPD. Our analysis reveals a\nfundamental and previously unexplored physics: enhancing entangling capability\ninevitably increases sensitivity, or bias, toward specific input states. By\nanalyzing representative two-qubit gates, we show that the gates with identical\nEP can exhibit markedly different EPD values, illustrating that the nature of\nentanglement generation can significantly differ depending on physical\nimplementation. Extending our framework to a class of generalized\ncontrolled-unitary operations acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces of arbitrary\ndimensions, we (re)affirm the inherent trade-off between the entangling\nstrength and uniformity. Moreover, we uncover a subtle\ndimension-parity-dependent behavior in entanglement generation, which EP alone\nfails to detect.

Indeed, we find the non-Markovianity to be negligible for\na single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing via interaction with a\nharmonic oscillator environment. In this paper, we examine a natural extension,\nnamely a pure dephasing model where a collection of two-level systems interacts\nwith a common environment. We obtain analytically the dynamics of the\ncollection of the two-level systems, and then take a partial trace over all the\ntwo-level systems except one. This remaining single two-level system is shown\nto display markedly non-Markovian dynamics, even in the weak system-environment\ncoupling regime. This is due to the indirect interaction between two-level\nsystems induced by their interaction with the common environment. In fact, this\nindirect interaction can not only increase the non-Markovianity by orders of\nmagnitude, but also display qualitatively different characteristics. For\ninstance, for a single two-level system undergoing pure dephasing, the dynamics\nare Markovian for Ohmic and sub-Ohmic environments. This is markedly not the\ncase when we consider multiple two-level systems. We also show that the\nnon-Markovianity increases as we increase the number of two-level systems.\nThese findings provide insights into controlling decoherence in multi-qubit\nquantum systems and have implications for quantum technologies where\nnon-Markovianity can be a resource rather than a limitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u591a\u4e2a\u53cc\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5171\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bian\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u53cc\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u8f83\u5f31\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u7acb\u7684\u53cc\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592bian\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5171\u540c\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592bian\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4e2a\u53cc\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5171\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u4f53\u663e\u7740\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592bian\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u5355\u72ec\u53cc\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u5982Ohmic\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u589e\u52a0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u65f6\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592bian\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6027\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}
