Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of\ncells and particles (<50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput\nsorting of larger biomaterials and particles (>50 micrometer) has been more\nlimited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness\nof the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density)\nthat can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or\nparticles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with\na contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface\nacoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and\nparticles (<50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (<1 ms), high\nbiocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally,\nTSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based\ndetection technique.

The technique is\nused to separate binary mixtures of small and large polyethylene particles\n(ranging between ~45-180 micrometer in size).

Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is\nadded to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the\ndynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix\napproaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can\ndeal with the stochastic wave functions approach. We did this on a 2-level\nsystem and found that it works well when comparing to a density matrix\napproach. Next, we tested a quantum particle connect to a bath of harmonic\noscillators using the stochastic approach. We found that a friction term is\nnecessary and applied it.

Collective coupling between a\nmacroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as\nFabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of\nindividual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect\nthe macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient\ncomputational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB)\nwith finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations\n(DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both\nthe cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble.

In this report, we analyze the NERSC workload and identify materials\nscience, quantum chemistry, and high-energy physics as the science domains and\napplication areas that stand to benefit most from quantum computers. These\ndomains jointly make up over 50% of the current NERSC production workload,\nwhich is illustrative of the impact quantum computing could have on NERSC's\nmission going forward. We perform an extensive literature review and determine\nthe quantum resources required to solve classically intractable problems within\nthese science domains. This review also shows that the quantum resources\nrequired have consistently decreased over time due to algorithmic improvements\nand a deeper understanding of the problems. At the same time, public technology\nroadmaps from a collection of ten quantum computing companies predict a\ndramatic increase in capabilities over the next five to ten years. Our analysis\nreveals a significant overlap emerging in this time frame between the\ntechnological capabilities and the algorithmic requirements in these three\nscientific domains.

Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in\nnanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has\nled to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties.\nThe mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and\nnanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature,\nsetting their force sensitivities below 1 $\\mathrm{aN}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$,\nsurpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs).

We\nreport a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent\nnanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By\nstudying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is\nmore severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric\nloss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries\nstatic charges.

Both one-vs-rest and two-step hierarchical\nclassification schemes were implemented. The QSVM involves angle encoding of\nten features, two unitary operator blocks consisting of rotational operator\ngates, and a projective measurement that projects the final state to the zero\nstate. The HHL-based method involves solving a system of linear equations using\nthe HHL algorithm and using the solution in a support vector machine approach.\nThe results indicate that the QSVM outperforms HHL LS-SVM in most cases. HHL\nLS-SVM performs somewhat competitively in selected cases, particularly when\nisolating galaxies (majority), however, it also performs poorly in others,\nespecially when isolating QSOs (minority). Comparisons with classical SVMs\nconfirm that quantum and classical methods achieve broadly similar performance,\nwith classical models performing slightly ahead overall. Scaling analysis\nreveals a trade-off: QSVM performance suffers from quadratic scaling with the\nnumber of samples and features, but benefits from explicit feature\nrepresentation during training, while HHL LS-SVM scales essentially constantly,\nwith moderate fluctuations, but suffers from limited representative elements.\nThe HHL-based method is also highly noise-sensitive.
