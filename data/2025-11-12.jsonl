A key to many of these phases is collective bosonic excitations, encoding fluctuations of the underlying order. In this work, we develop a general theoretical framework for parametric driving of such modes, whereby periodic modulation of microscopic parameters generates resonant two-boson processes. We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science. Our work provides the toolbox for controlling these excitations."}

The non-reciprocal response is strongest at a central position between the zone corner and edge mid-point. We explain these results using an effective linear spin-wave model. While directional effects in chiral magnets have so far only been known to exist at low momenta close to the center of the Brillouin zone, the present study shows that non-reciprocity persists at the highest possible reduced momenta. The observed magnons show very little damping within the limits of our experimental resolution, making them of great interest for the fundamental research on compact, high-frequency magnonic applications."}

Magnetic susceptibility reveals canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) ordering at T_N = 125 K, two compensation points (T_comp1 and T_comp2), followed by magnetization reversal with a magnetic susceptibility minimum between T_comp1 and T_comp2. Heat capacity shows a sharp lambda-type transition at T_N, associated with the long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of Cr, followed by a broad feature near 9 K. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) establishes the Pn'm'a (Gamma2) magnetic structure below T_N. A gradual change in magnetic structure occurs during the spin-reorientation (SRO) transition below 30 K, where the magnetic symmetry transforms from Pn'm'a (Gamma2) to Pn'ma' (Gamma4) phase. However, below the SRO, neither Gamma2 nor Gamma4 alone adequately fit the intensity of magnetic reflections. A satisfactory refinement is achieved using the monoclinic subgroup P21'/c', derived from a combination of Gamma2 and Gamma4. The gradual SRO of Tm and Cr moments across the compensation regime is consistent with the magnetic symmetry P21'/c'. Furthermore, the ordered moments of Cr and Tm in TmCrO3 exhibit a complex, non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the Tm sublattice driving the spin-reorientation transition near the compensation point. Anomalies in the lattice parameters reveal strong magnetoelastic coupling, linking structural distortions to the SRO."}

Correlated electronic orders, such as charge-density waves and superconductivity, are observed to intertwine with subtle time-reversal symmetry breaking whose microscopic origin is not currently understood. Here, we provide evidence for such time-reversal symmetry breaking in the kagome metal TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ arising from staggered magnetic moments within the kagome layers. TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of metallic V kagome layers separated by Tb triangular layers that host Ising ferromagnetic order. Deep in the ferromagnetic state, the Tb Ising doublet ground state should display a single, dispersionless spin-flip excitation. Instead, inelastic neutron scattering reveals two sharp excitations associated with inequivalent Tb sites, demonstrating that a symmetry-broken phase coexists with Ising ferromagnetism. No additional structural or magnetic phase transitions are detected, and first-principles calculations rule out lattice distortions as the origin of the splitting. We attribute this effect to time-reversal symmetry breaking encoded by small V moments that couple to the Tb sublattice and leave a measurable spectral fingerprint. Our results establish rare-earth local moment spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of subtle broken symmetries and highlight an unexpected interplay between kagome magnetism and rare-earth local moment magnetism."}

We study the variation of the activity amplitude and phase lag as a function of the applied frequency~$ω$, using numerical simulations. The amplitude increases with~$ω$, reaches a plateau, and then decreases again for large~$ω$. The phase lag increases monotonically with~$ω$ and finally saturates to $3π/2$ when~$ω$ is large. The activity is no longer a single-valued function of the attractant signal, and plotting activity versus attractant concentration over one complete time period generates a loop. We monitor the loop area as a function of~$ω$ and find two peaks for small and large~$ω$, and a sharp minimum at intermediate~$ω$ values. We explain these results as an interplay between the time scales associated with adaptation, activity switching, and applied signal variation. In particular, for very large~$ω$, the quasi-equilibrium approximation for activity dynamics breaks down, a regime that has not been explored in earlier studies.

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics."}

Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed approach as an effective and accurate method to predict GS across physical conditions--from slow to fast rotation and from isotropic to anisotropic confinement.

Within the covariant phase space formalism, we define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with the local boosts, detaching the gravitational entropy from horizons or trapped surfaces. Our definition encompasses and generalizes the existing notions of entropy. Using this definition for the Einstein gravity case, we compute variations of the entropy along the path of any causal observer and establish that the entropy variations are always non-negative if the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition integrated along any segment of the causal path."}

The intersection of all valid Bell inequalities is the so-called local polytope. In multipartite systems, characterizing the local polytope quickly becomes an intractable task as the system size increases. Optimizing Bell inequalities to maximize the ratio between their quantum value and classical bound is key to understanding multipartite nonlocality. We propose a gradient-based method for this optimization. Numerical results indicate that local maxima of this ratio typically correspond to facet Bell inequalities of the local polytope. This enables an iterative search for tight and robust Bell inequalities. Applied to permutation-invariant scenarios, the method provides tight Bell inequalities with large quantum violations and facilitates experimental certification of Bell correlations without full knowledge of the local polytope."}

Starting from the QNM contribution to the Wightman function of a scalar field on a static, spherically symmetric black hole background, we derive the response function of a two-level Unruh--DeWitt detector following simple trajectories (static at fixed radius, with comments on radial free fall). The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit.

We compare this timescale with the inverse of the maximum Lyapunov exponent $λ$ and its saturation time, which are systematically shorter. The Toda integral ergodization/equilibrium time is system size independent for long chains, but show dramatic growth when the system size is smaller than a critical one, whose value depends on the energy density.

It is found that the appearance of these two states requires that the characteristic hole concentration below which the Mott-Heisenberg and Slater mechanisms of electron localization occurs $p_{\\rm MS}$ nearly coincides with the hole concentration where the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point is placed at the vicinity of the Fermi level. When this condition is met the VHS point is pined at which the nesting condition of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuation is fulfilled almost everywhere on the Fermi surface in wide range of the hole concentration in a metallic state, i.e., the strange metal state. The spin fluctuation of the strange metal state is nearly quantum critical and the dynamical spin susceptivity is well described by overdamped spin wave having the $ω/T$ scaling with the relaxation rate at the Planckian limit. Because of these distinctive features of the strange metal state, the $k$ dependence of scattering rate of electrons is small and electrons behave as the marginal Fermi liquid, resulting in $T$-linear resistivity. In contrast, the pseudogap state is magnetically in the renormalized classical regime and the pseudogap is formed near the X point where the nesting condition of the short-range AFM order is fulfilled."}

Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions. The excitation of resonant modes in the superparticle enhances the emission intensity and reduces the degree of its backward asymmetry. Furthermore, coating the CdS quantum dot particle with a silicon dioxide layer increases the probability of exciting field resonances in such a core-shell superparticle."}

Ag catalysts provide the CO$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ CO reaction capability, and Cu catalysts provide the CO $\\rightarrow$ high-value products reaction capability. Given a set of input parameters -- applied surface voltage, electrolyte flow rate, and number of catalyst sections -- the optimization algorithm uses adjoint methods to modify the Ag/Cu surface patterning in order to maximize the current density toward high-value products, such as ethylene. The optimized designs, which strongly depend on these input parameters, yield significant performance enhancement especially at more negative applied voltages (i.e., stronger surface reactions) and for larger numbers of patterning sections. For an applied voltage of $-1.7$ V vs. SHE, the $12$-section optimized design increases the current density towards ethylene by up to $65\\%$ compared to the unoptimized $2$-section design. Observed differences in the production and consumption of CO (the key intermediate species) provide insight into increased ethylene production in the optimized cases.

At the EIC, these are mainly $K_L$'s and neutrons: for lower energies, excellent relative momentum measurements of a few 10\\% are achieved using time-of-flight, while for higher particle momenta, the energy can be measured calorimetrically with a resolution significantly better than has been demonstrated for similar calorimeters that are read out with less granularity."}

The interpretation of its in-plane anisotropy has remained unsettled due to structural twinning, which superimposes orthogonal magnetic responses. Here we combine controlled crystal growth with magnetization and rotational magnetometry to disentangle the effects of twinning. Nearly untwinned high-quality single crystals reveal the intrinsic in-plane anisotropy: the in-plane easy axis saturates at $M_{\\text{easy}}(4~\\text{T}) \\approx 1.8~μ_{\\text{B}}$/Ce, while the in-plane hard axis magnetization is strongly suppressed, nearly linear, and comparable to the out-of-plane response. These results resolve long-standing discrepancies in reported magnetic measurements, in which in-plane metamagnetic transition fields and saturation magnetization varied significantly across previous studies. Growth experiments demonstrate that avoiding the proposed $α$-$β$ structural transition $-$ through Sb-rich flux and slower cooling $-$ systematically reduces twinning. However, powder X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis measurements show no clear evidence of a distinct $β$ phase. Our results establish a consistent magnetic phase diagram and provide essential constraints for crystal-electric field models, enabling a clearer understanding of the interplay between anisotropic magnetism and unconventional superconductivity in CeSb$_2$."}

Our approach employs two oblique laser beams and a capillary-array collimation system to address these challenges while maintaining efficient deceleration. For rubidium ($^{87}$Rb), simulations demonstrate a significant increase in the fraction of atoms captured by a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D-MOT) and nearly eliminate atom-induced contamination probability at optical windows, all within a compact Zeeman slower length of 44 cm. Experimental validation with Rb and Yb demonstrates highly efficient atomic loading within the same compact design. This advancement represents a substantial improvement for high-flux cold atom applications, providing reliable performance for high-precision metrology, quantum computation and simulation."}

However, they face challenges in sensing gases with high sensitivity due to weak light-gas interaction. Slow light, which dramatically intensifies light-matter interaction through spatial compression of optical energy, provides a promising solution. Herein, we demonstrate a dual slow-light scheme for enhancing the sensitivity of photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) with a suspended photonic crystal waveguide (PhCW) on a CMOS-compatible silicon platform. By tailoring the dispersion of the PhCW to generate structural slow light to enhance pump absorption and probe phase modulation, we achieve a photothermal efficiency of 3.6x10-4 rad cm ppm-1 mW-1 m-1, over 1-3 orders of magnitude higher than the strip waveguides and optical fibers. With a 1-mm-long sensing PhCW incorporated in a stabilized on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a footprint of 0.6 mm2, we demonstrate acetylene detection with a sensitivity of 1.4x10-6 in terms of noise-equivalent absorption and length product (NEAL), the best among the reported photonic waveguide gas sensors to our knowledge. The dual slow-light enhanced PTS paves the way for integrated photonic gas sensors with high sensitivity, miniaturization, and cost-effective mass production."}

Bulk crystals of this 3D topological insulator exhibit a transition from bulk to surface-dominated conductivity below 100 K, whereas in thin flakes, bulk conductivity is suppressed at even higher temperatures. Our data therefore suggest that a key ingredient for elevated mobility is the absence of bulk carriers at the Fermi level. A fingerprint of the high-mobility carriers, i.e a steep low-field magnetoresistance along with a strong Hall effect nonlinearity below 1 T, signifies the presence of at least two surface-related carrier species, even when bulk states are frozen out. To explain the magnetoresistance and the Hall effect in a wider range of magnetic fields ($>1$ T), one must assume that the carrier mobility drops with the field. The influence of Zeeman splitting on mobility and the contribution of anomalous Hall conductivity provide a much better description of the magnetoresistance and the nonlinearity of the Hall coefficient. Our data call for a revision of the surface state mobility in 3D topological insulators."}

This allows us to identify Weyl-covariant structures in the solution space, including hierarchies of recursion relations encoding the flux-balance laws. We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance. This connection is naturally formulated within the Newman-Penrose formalism by performing a partially off-shell conformal compactification and identifying the analogue of the Ashtekar-Streubel symplectic structure in the radial expansion near the null hypersurface. Using this framework, we identify the celestial $Lw_{1+\\infty}$ symmetries in the subleading phase space at finite distance by constructing their canonical generators and imposing self-duality conditions.

However, standard CRNNs cannot represent pressure-dependent rate behavior, which is critical in many combustion and chemical systems and typically requires empirical formulations such as Troe or PLOG. Here, we develop Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Networks (KA-CRNNs) that generalize CRNNs by modeling each kinetic parameter as a learnable function of system pressure using Kolmogorov-Arnold activations. This structure maintains full interpretability and physical consistency while enabling assumption-free inference of pressure effects directly from data. A proof-of-concept study on the CH3 recombination reaction demonstrates that KA-CRNNs accurately reproduce pressure-dependent kinetics across a range of temperatures and pressures, outperforming conventional interpolative models. The framework establishes a foundation for data-driven discovery of extended kinetic behaviors in complex reacting systems, advancing interpretable and physics-consistent approaches for chemical model inference."}

In this work we show that equilibration processes are radically different in lattices subject to discrete-step unitary evolution, which have been implemented in photonic circuits, coin polarisation walkers and time-multiplexed pulses in fibres. Using numerical simulations, we show that weak nonlinearities lead to an equilibrium state of equal modal occupation across all the bands, i.e, a thermal state with infinite temperature and chemical potential. This state is reached no matter the initial distribution of modes and independent of the bands dispersions and gaps. We show that by engineering the temporal periodicity inherent to these systems, equilibration can be accelerated through resonant Floquet channels. Our results demonstrate that discrete time plays a crucial role in wave dynamics, fundamentally altering thermalisation processes within weak wave turbulence theory."}

We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy."}

For zero field, the classical ground state of the model presents an accidental degeneracy, which has a particularly simple form and which can be expressed in terms of a simple symmetry of the classical energy. The model thus offers a particularly transparent realization of a theory with quantum order-by-disorder and a pseudo-Goldstone mode. We analyze the spectrum at zero magnetic field by calculating the self-energy at one-loop order, using a self-consistent renormalization of the gap and the energy scale.

While previous studies have shown that higher-order hopping or constrained quasiperiodic potentials can induce a mixed-phase zone in one dimension, we demonstrate that the dissipation can induce mixed phase zone in a one dimensional nearest-neighbor system without imposing any explicit constraints on the quasiperiodic potential or hopping param- eter. Our approach exploits an exact correspondence between the eigenspectrum of the Liouvillian superoperator and that of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, valid for quadratic fermionic systems un- der linear dissipation. Using third quantization approach within Majorana fermionic representation, we analyze two dissipation configurations: alternating gain and loss at every site, and at alternate sites under balanced and imbalanced conditions. By computing the inverse and normalized partici- pation ratios, we show that dissipation can drive the system into three distinct phases: delocalizd, mixed, and localized. Notably, the mixed-phase zone is absent for balanced dissipation at every site but emerges upon introducing imbalance, while for alternate site dissipation it appears in both balanced and imbalanced cases. Furthermore, the critical points and the width of the mixed-phase window can be selectively tuned by varying the dissipation strength. These findings reveal that the dissipation plays a decisive role in reshaping localization transitions in quasiperiodic systems, offering new insight into the interplay between non-Hermitian effects and quasiperiodic order."}

We identify two distinct computational regimes: short-term prediction is optimized using smoothed, low-dimensional states with minimal training, whereas prediction around the Mackey-Glass delay time benefits from unsmoothed, high-dimensional states and extended training. Reservoir computing metrics reveal that slower input rates are more tolerant to output smoothing, while faster input rates degrade both memory capacity and nonlinear processing.

Here, we introduce a quantum-centric machine learning (QCML) model-a hybrid quantum-classical framework that integrates parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with Transformer-based machine learning to directly predict molecular wavefunctions and quantum observables. By pretraining the Transformer on a diverse dataset of molecules and ansatz types and subsequently fine-tuning it for specific systems, QCML learns transferable mappings between molecular descriptors and PQC parameters, eliminating the need for iterative variational optimization. The pretrained model achieves chemical accuracy in potential energy surfaces, atomic forces, and dipole moments across multiple molecules and ansatzes, and enables efficient AIMD simulations with infrared spectra prediction. This work establishes a scalable and transferable quantum-centric machine learning paradigm, bridging variational quantum algorithms and modern deep learning for next-generation molecular simulation and quantum chemistry applications."}

Our analysis reveals a rich variety of phases, including both uniform and spatially modulated symmetry-broken states, some of which feature an order parameter oscillating at half the drive frequency. When coupled to a background electromagnetic potential, these phases exhibit a Meissner effect, in the sense that the photon acquires a mass term. However, if the order parameter oscillates around a sufficiently small value, a fraction of an externally applied magnetic field can penetrate the sample in the form of a standing wave. We dub this property a \\textit{Meissner polariton}, that is, a collective mode resulting from the hybridization of light with order parameter oscillations. Furthermore, near the onset of symmetry breaking, strong fluctuations give rise to a superconducting-like response even in the absence of a Meissner effect or of a Meissner polariton. Our results are relevant to experiments on light-induced orders, particularly superconductivity."}

The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy."}

A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration."}

Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials present a particularly promising platform due to their robustness against stray fields and their potential for exceptional DW velocities. Among various proposed driving mechanisms, coherent spin waves could potentially propel AFM DWs to the magnon group velocity while minimizing dissipation from Joule heating. However, experimental realization has remained elusive due to the dual challenges of generating coherent AFM spin waves near isolated mobile AFM DWs and simultaneously measuring high-speed DW dynamics. Here we experimentally realize an approach where ultrafast laser pulses generate coherent spin waves that drive AFM DWs and develop a technique to directly map the spatiotemporal DW dynamics. Using the room-temperature AFM insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$, we observe AFM DW motion with record-high velocities up to ~50 km/s. Remarkably, the direction of DW propagation is controllable through both the pump laser helicity and the sign of the DW winding number. This bidirectional control can be theoretically explained, and numerically reproduced, by the DW dynamics induced by coherent spin waves of the in-plane magnon mode - a phenomenon unique to magnets with an easy-plane anisotropy. Our work uncovers a novel DW propulsion mechanism that is generalizable to a wide range of AFM materials, unlocking new opportunities for ultrafast coherent AFM spintronics."}

Starting from the halo-only geometry determined by the rotation curve relation, we solve the Einstein equations with the Burkert stress-energy and enforce a Schwarzschild boundary condition, obtaining closed form metric functions in which the halo contribution deforms the redshift or shape functions and reduces to the Schwarzschild limit when the halo parameters vanish. On this background we study linear perturbations of test fields with spins $s=0,1,2$ and compute their quasinormal spectra using both a high order WKB scheme and continued fraction method, complemented by time domain evolutions. We find that increasing either the Burkert core radius $r_0$ or the central density $ρ_0$ generically shifts the real part of the frequencies upward and enhances damping, while the multipole index $l$ primarily increases the oscillation frequency with a milder impact on the decay rate. The two frequency extraction methods agree to within small, systematic offsets across the explored parameter space.

Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes."}

Rooted in the inviolable fundamental laws of quantum mechanics, QSDC enables ultrasensitive detection of even the faintest eavesdropping attempts, guaranteeing true communication security solely when no interference exists. If eavesdropping or intrusion is detected mid-transmission, the system instantly alerts users and severs data flow, shielding them from unauthorized tracking and mitigating hacker threats. Over two decades, QSDC has seen extraordinary advancements, currently attaining kilobit-per-second transmission over 100 km of commercial optical fiber. However, its practical scalability remains constrained by insufficient transmission rates, a critical bottleneck. Semantic communication, which drastically boosts transmission efficiency by extracting core information features, nevertheless stays vulnerable to malicious intrusions. Integrating these paradigms promises to simultaneously enhance equivalent data rate and security. Herein, we propose and experimentally validate a quantum semantic communication scheme, applying it to 3D point clouds. It achieves a 46.30-fold efficiency gain over direct transmission, surpassing both Wyner and Shannon capacity limits. This breakthrough not only clears the path for large-scale QSDC deployment but also marks a pivotal milestone in quantum information science."}

Shortly thereafter, a comment by M. Han [4] challenged our findings, citing \"physical and technical issues concerning the original experiment and the new characterisation\" inclusing purported contributions from Auger electrons, unfiltered low-energy harmonics, and uncompensated intrinsic chirp. These concerns, however, stem from misinterpretation of the experimental regime, selective citation of context, and disregard for well-established results in the peer-reviewed literature. In this reply, we address and clarify these points, demonstrating that the issues raised are not relevant under our experimental conditions. Given the highly specialized nature of attosecond genertaion and metrology in the soft X-ray water-window regime, we consider it essential to clarify these aspects of different regimes and reaffirm teh validity of our conclusions."}

Our analysis reveals that the geodesic that accurately satisfies the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy consists of a timelike curve and a curve whose coordinates are complex.

Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern.

For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading."}

Starting from the ground vibronic state, we find that JT molecules collectively coupled to a common cavity can access a cascade of high-angular-momentum vibronic states in the presence of a single cavity photon, in sharp contrast to the single molecule case where the range of accessible vibronic angular momentum values are bounded. The observable consequences are a broadening of the cavity-molecular polariton spectrum and a suppression of photon polarization dynamics under broadband excitation of the system.

In previous works, signatures of topology have mainly been investigated from the perspective of edge states - strongly localised modes with exponentially decaying intensity into the bulk. While these edge states have become the hallmark of topological systems as they can facilitate non-reciprocal transport in potential applications, the topology is fundamentally encoded in the bulk band structure. In particular, the momentum-dependence of the eigenstates, i.e., the wave functions, determines the topology, usually reflected in a bulk band inversion. We present a band inversion in the paradigmatic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, characterised by a reversal of the sublattice symmetry, quantified by the expectation value $\\langle σ_\\mathrm{x} \\rangle$, when going from the centre of the Brillouin zone to the zone boundary. Here, we show direct experimental access to this bulk band inversion in SSH exciton-polariton chains, using two-dimensional momentum-space ($k$-space) mapping - without the need for real-space imaging. This technique enables the direct observation of the momentum-dependent inversion of the sublattice symmetry in the bulk bands, providing a unique perspective on topological phases beyond conventional edge state measurements. Our approach establishes effective momentum-resolved sublattice phase measurements as a powerful tool for accessing the wave function and bulk topology in photonic and polaritonic systems and beyond."}

We show that the feasibility and strength of this drive depend sensitively on whether the targeted parameter alters the properties of the bosonic excitations vacuum, linking potential parametric instabilities directly to the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state. The driving facilitates nonthermal melting of the parent orders, as well as stabilization of novel steady states with experimentally distinct signatures. Through microscopic case-studies of correlated electronic systems, we identify promising driving knobs, highlight the role of quantum geometry in the collective modes susceptibility, and propose realistic experimental probes. Collective excitations are a powerful resource for steering correlated phases out of equilibrium, and will likely have several applications in quantum science.

The electron density distribution is chosen to preserve a generalized Carter constant. We explore the shadow cast by this class of rotating wormhole in the presence of both homogeneous and non homogeneous plasma as seen by an asymptotic observer. The photon regions are visualized, and the influence of geometric parameters, plasma parameters, and the observer inclination angle with the rotation axis on the resulting shadow morphology is analyzed. We tried to implement constraints on the plasma and the geometrical parameters of the wormhole such as the spin parameter and the deviation (from Kerr) parameter in the back drop of recent observational bounds coming from the deviation from circularity of the shadow boundary ($ΔC$) and deviation of the average shadow radius from Schwarzschild ($δ$). The bound on $ΔC$ is satisfied by the theoretically allowed range of parameters thus not found very useful to put any constraint, we could impose stringent constraints on the parameters based on the observed value of $δ$.

Superparticles exhibit unique optical, chemical, and electronic properties. These properties are not merely the sum of the constituent quantum dots but rather bear the signature of the collective behavior of the nanoscale building blocks. In particular, assembling an ensemble of quantum dots into a super-sphere allows them to function as a single, high-quality optical resonator. This structure efficiently confines the emission from the pump-excited quantum dots via whispering gallery modes. The emissive properties of such a superparticle resonator remain an area of active investigation. Using numerical simulation, we study the angular structure of the photoluminescence from superparticles of various sizes and architectures formed from CdS quantum dots. We show that, in general, the angular distribution of the SP emission is characterized by strong asymmetry, with a maximum in the backward direction relative to the incident pump beam. In contrast, this asymmetry is virtually absent in the forward and side-scattering directions.

Magnetometry is among the most promising applications, where chip-scale optomechanical sensors offer high sensitivity without the cryogenics or magnetic shielding required by competing technologies. However, lack of compatibility with integrated photonics and electronics has posed a major barrier. Here we introduce silicon-on-insulator optomechanical magnetometers to address this barrier. A new post-release lithography process enables high-quality metallisation of released mechanical structures, overcoming the incompatibility between silicon-on-insulator fabrication and functional magnetic films. This allows us to employ photonic-crystal cavities that enhance motion-to-optical signal transduction by over an order of magnitude. The resulting devices achieve magnetic field sensitivity of 800 pT Hz^-1/2, three orders of magnitude beyond previous waveguide-integrated designs. The advances we report provide a path towards high-performance, room temperature and chip-integrated magnetometers for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and navigation to resource exploration."}

This link invariant was originally introduced by M. Khovanov and L. Rozansky through a sophisticated matrix factorization technique based on the bicomplex structure, which depends on entire link diagrams and rapidly increases in complexity with the growth of a link. However, for particular link diagrams a local reduction is possible, allowing to eliminate vertices in a regular way, and thus, simplifying the KR polynomial and making it as simple as the Khovanov polynomial in the $N=2$ case. In particular, for a distinguished family of bipartite links, matrix factorization defined on MOY diagrams reduces just to planar cycles - very similar to the original Kauffman-Khovanov construction at $N=2$ for the Jones polynomial and its $t$-deformation. In the bipartite case, this can be done for any $N$. We make a further step of simplification and reduce from cohomology factor-rings in even variables crucially depending on a MOY diagram to vector spaces spanned by odd variables, so that the initial bicomplex of matrix factorizations becomes a monocomplex of just tensor products of $N$-dimensional vector spaces. We also find the explicit form of three universal morphisms which were guessed in a recent paper on this subject. Universality means independence of the other edges of the diagram, and we explain why this works in this particular case."}

The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \\textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response.

We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium.

However, achieving strong and robust macroscopic entanglement remains a long-standing challenge due to the inherently linear nature of the beam-splitter interaction. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to generate and enhance macroscopic entanglement between two remote magnon modes by injecting squeezed vacuum fields (SVFs) into coupled microwave cavities. We demonstrate that even a single SVF applied to one cavity can induce steady magnon-magnon entanglement, while applying two SVFs (the double-squeezed configuration) enables selective activation of two independent entanglement channels associated with the cavity supermodes. Remarkably, quantum interference between the two SVFs allows for phase-controlled enhancement of entanglement, resulting in significantly improved robustness against cavity dissipation and thermal noise. Under realistic parameters, the survival temperature of quantum entanglement increases from approximately $260$ mK to $450$ mK. Our results open a promising route toward controllable and thermally resilient macroscopic entanglement in cavity magnonics.

While previous studies have primarily focused on magic in single systems, its interactions and distribution in multipartite settings remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mutual mana as a measure of magic correlations defined in close analogy with quantum mutual information. Our definition builds upon mana, which is the established quantifier of magic based on discrete Wigner function negativity. We characterize magic correlations generated by discrete beamsplitters, whose Gaussian counterparts are fundamental components in quantum optics and quantum technologies. We show that coupling a magic state with a stabilizer vacuum state via a discrete beamsplitter will induce a full conversion of local magic into mutual mana, thereby establishing a mechanism for redistributing magic resources as magic correlations. We reveal the fundamental properties of mutual mana and derive its explicit expressions for several prototypical qutrit states subject to a discrete beamsplitter. We make a comparative study of mutual mana with several established quantifiers of correlations generated by the qutrit beamsplitter, including quantum mutual information, mutual $L^1$-norm magic, and mutual stabilizer 2-Rényi entropy."}

Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime."}

In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become \"inequalities of motion\" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states.

Our coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) scheme offers a broadband cancellation capability with a tunable, wavelength-flexible, and compact system. This is achieved through the implementation of an optical equivalent of an opto-mechanical interaction, facilitated by a down-conversion and a beam-splitting process. The intricate nature of the system and its multiple interacting components made characterizing the interdependent parameters with conventional methods ineffective, leading to the development of an in-situ characterization scheme. The obtained parameters meet the targets for CQNC set in previous studies. With our current realization, we project a broadband quantum noise reduction of 3.6 dB, corresponding to a 77% reduction in quantum back-action noise at the optimal frequency of maximum reduction, indicating the readiness of the ENMO for application. We discuss the prospects for new applications in quantum information and communication using the same platform."}

This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy.

We find that the noncommutative parameter $Θ$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $Θ$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

Here we apply perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED) to a many-body (MB) system of atoms modeled as charged harmonic oscillators, and reveal a persistent inverse-distance MB-QED interaction stemming from the coupling between virtual photons and molecular plasmons in the non-retarded regime. This interaction, scaling with the third power of the fine-structure constant, is reminiscent of the Lamb shift for a single atom.

The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit.

In particular, the decoherence induces an unconventional critical mixed state, where the logical information is preserved but the rest of the system exhibits mixed state criticality. For a fixed point, the decohered subsystem code is understood by the ``gauging out\" prescription. By mapping the GHM to the toric code subject to decoherence, we can understand the properties of the subsystem code. We further discuss and investigate the robustness of the logical space of the subsystem code. Although this kind of subsystem code can be produced by using any bulk mixed state in the GHM, its robustness is a subtle problem due to the mixed critical gauge qubits. We consider some specific unitary for examining the robustness of the stored quantum information.

We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance.

We experimentally demonstrate that, even when both the pump and the down-converted photons propagate through a dynamic scattering medium, the pairs maintain a sharp peak in their correlations. A comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis shows that these correlations persist regardless of when the pairs are generated, whether immediately after the pump is scattered or under other conditions. More specifically, we detail how the shape of the angular correlation depends on the pump's scattering and how it varies with the distance between the pair-generation region and the entrance of the disordered medium. These findings represent a crucial step toward understanding quantum light generation in complex media, and potentially exploiting it for quantum technologies."}

We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies.

Consequently, we assess three chain variants: the full network including all colours, a network without black, and a network without black and white, to quantify the effect of hub pruning under realistic circuit depths and measurement budgets. Across networks aggregated from multiple retailers, hub pruning consistently improves quantum and classical agreement at shallow depth; total-variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence typically decrease by approximately a factor of two relative to the full network, while state fidelities remain close to unity. A bias-and-contraction analysis explains these gains through reduced cross-terms and an effectively widened spectral gap.

We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\\sim 50\\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $Λ$CDM paradigm."}

Secular growth is handled by a suitable covariant resummation scheme, which reorganises the degrees of freedom at each order in the expansion while preserving the sum. Our scheme can be applied to any order in the gradient expansion; we provide the explicit formulation at first and second orders. When working to first order, we find that the BDNK equations of motion emerge as an intermediate step in a calculation performed in the Landau frame. We show that non-hydrodynamic modes appear only in such intermediate calculations and cancel when evaluating solutions to the required order. Our procedure does not introduce any other fields or require any additional initial data beyond those appearing in the theory of ideal fluids."}

We propose a three-stage framework: starting with a classical self-training model, then introducing a minimal hybrid quantum variant, and finally applying diagnostic feedback via QMetric to refine the hybrid architecture. In experiments on the Iris dataset, the refined hybrid model improved accuracy from 0.31 in the classical approach to 0.87 in the quantum approach. These results suggest that even modest quantum components, when guided by proper diagnostics, can enhance class separation and representation capacity in hybrid learning, offering a practical pathway for classical machine learning practitioners to leverage quantum-enhanced methods."}

Being formally equivalent to the solution of the MB Schrödinger equation, EF sets up a strategy for the construction of efficient approximations in the theory of the correlated electronic-nuclear motion. Here we extend the EF formalism to incorporate the case of a system under the action of an electromagnetic field. An important interplay between the physical magnetic and the Berry-curvature fields is revealed and discussed within the fully non-adiabatic theory. In particular, it is a known property of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that, for a neutral atom in a uniform magnetic field, the latter is compensated by the Berry-curvature field in the nuclear equation of motion (\\citet{Yin-92}). From an intuitive argument that the atom must not be deflected by the Lorentz force from a straight line trajectory, it has been conjectured that the same compensation should occur within the EF theory as well. We give a rigorous proof of this property."}

A natural generalization of this property is to consider whether a notion of maximal entanglement is possible among all states with the same spectrum (where the aforementioned case of pure states corresponds to the particular choice in which the spectrum is a delta distribution, i.e., rank-1 states). Despite positive evidence in the past that such a notion might exist at least in the case of two-qubit states, it was recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 050202 (2024)] that the answer to the above question is negative. This reference proved this for particular choices of the spectrum in the case of rank-2 two-qubit density matrices. While this settles the problem in general, it still leaves open whether there are other choices of the spectrum outside the case of pure states where a maximally entangled state for a fixed spectrum might exist. In this work we extend this impossibility result to all rank-2 and rank-3 two-qubit states as well as for a large class of eigenvalue distributions in the case where the rank equals four."}

We analyze difficulties of gradient-based methods (e.g., SLSQP, BFGS) in noisy regimes, where they diverge or stagnate.

We show that when the quantum walk parameters, such as the coin operator and initial state, satisfy the conditions of the ergodic theorem for random walks on finite groups, the resulting sequence converges asymptotically to the uniform distribution. Although correlations between successive outcomes are unavoidable, they can be significantly reduced by a suitable choice of the evolution time. By analyzing the iterated convolution of the quantum walk transition probability and exploiting the ergodic theorem, we demonstrate convergence of the marginal distributions toward the uniform distribution in the asymptotic limit."}

These capabilities are particularly relevant for machine learning, where state-of-the-art models especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) suffer from prohibitive time complexity due to massive matrix multiplications and high-dimensional optimization.\n  In this manuscript, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Classical selection mechanism for the Mamba architecture, designed specifically for temporal sequence classification problems.

Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, for example, depend only on pairwise information -- expectations and correlations between binary variables -- yet standard quantum circuits explore exponentially large state spaces. We recast qubit-efficient optimization as a geometry problem: the minimal representation should match the $O(N^2)$ structure of quadratic objectives. The key insight is that the local-consistency problem -- ensuring that pairwise marginals correspond to a realizable global distribution -- coincides exactly with the Sherali-Adams level-2 polytope $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$, the tightest convex relaxation expressible at the two-body level. Previous qubit-efficient approaches enforced this consistency only implicitly. Here we make it explicit: (a) anchoring learning to the $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ geometry, (b) projecting via a differentiable iterative-proportional-fitting (IPF) step, and (c) decoding through a maximum-entropy Gibbs sampler. This yields a logarithmic-width pipeline ($2\\lceil\\log_2 N\\rceil + 2$ qubits) that is classically simulable yet achieves strong empirical performance. On Gset Max-Cut instances (N=800--2000), depth-2--3 circuits reach near-optimal ratios ($r^* \\approx 0.99$), surpassing direct $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ baselines. The framework resolves the local-consistency gap by giving it a concrete convex geometry and a minimal differentiable projection, establishing a clean polyhedral baseline. Extending beyond $\\mathrm{SA}(2)$ naturally leads to spectrahedral geometries, where curvature encodes global coherence and genuine quantum structure becomes necessary."}

The ansatz does not compress information as effectively as tensor networks, but it has the advantages (i) of allowing accurate extraction of information, (ii) of being structurally independent of the geometry of the system, (iii) of being readily parallelizable, and (iv) of allowing analytical shortcuts. We first study the typical properties of the SPS ansatz for spin-$1/2$ systems, including its entanglement entropy, and its trainability.

Here, we study and generalize a surprisingly elegant geometric transform, the hyperbolism of curves originally found by Isaac Newton, which allows to transform ellipses into Lorentzian lines, and vice versa. With this, we show that the Bloch picture and especially corresponding phase-space representations are directly geometrically related to the Lorentzian line shape. We also introduce a novel continuous parametrization of Newton's transform which results in further interesting line shapes.

The contemporary solution, halting the entire quantum computation for recalibration, is unsustainable for the long runtimes of the future algorithms. We address this challenge by unifying calibration with computation, granting the quantum error correction process a dual role: its error detection events are not only used to correct the logical quantum state, but are also repurposed as a learning signal, teaching a reinforcement learning agent to continuously steer the physical control parameters and stabilize the quantum system during the computation. We experimentally demonstrate this framework on a superconducting processor, improving the logical error rate stability of the surface code 3.5-fold against injected drift and pushing the performance beyond what is achievable with state-of-the-art traditional calibration and human-expert tuning. Simulations of surface codes up to distance-15 confirm the scalability of our method, revealing an optimization speed that is independent of the system size. This work thus enables a new paradigm: a quantum computer that learns to self-improve directly from its errors and never stops computing."}

This is particularly true when we focus on highly-constrained early fault-tolerant devices. Many attempts to optimize algorithms for early fault-tolerance focus on simple metrics, such as the circuit depth or T-count. These metrics fail to capture critical overheads, such as the spacetime cost of Clifford operations and routing, or miss they key optimizations. We propose the FLuid Allocation of Surface code Qubits (FLASQ) cost model, tailored for architectures that use a two-dimensional lattice of qubits to implement the two-dimensional surface code. FLASQ abstracts away the complexity of routing by assuming that ancilla space and time can be fluidly rearranged, allowing for the tractable estimation of spacetime volume while still capturing important details neglected by simpler approaches. At the same time, it enforces constraints imposed by the circuit's measurement depth and the processor's reaction time. We apply FLASQ to analyze the cost of a standard two-dimensional lattice model simulation, finding that modern advances (such as magic state cultivation and the combination of quantum error correction and mitigation) reduce both the time and space required for this task by an order of magnitude compared with previous estimates. We also analyze the Hamming weight phasing approach to synthesizing parallel rotations, revealing that despite its low T-count, the overhead from imposing a 2D layout and from its use of additional ancilla qubits will make it challenging to benefit from in early fault-tolerance. We hope that the FLASQ cost model will help to better align early fault-tolerant algorithmic design with actual hardware realization costs without demanding excessive knowledge of quantum error correction from quantum algorithmists."}

We work in the setting of deep thermalization from many-body physics: starting from a bipartite state on a global system $(A,B)$ drawn from a $k$-design, we measure system $B$ in the computational basis, keep the outcome and examine the state that remains in system $A$, approximating the overall ensemble (the 'projected ensemble') by a $k'$-design. We ask: how does the design quality change due to this procedure, or how does $k'$ compare to $k$? We give the first rigorous example of unitary dynamics generating a state such that, projection at very early (constant) times can boost design randomness. These dynamics are those of quantum chaos, modeled by the evolution of a Hamiltonian drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). We show that, even though a state generated by such dynamics at constant time only forms a $k=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ design, the projected ensemble is Haar-random (or a $k'=\\infty$ design) in the thermodynamic limit (i.e. when $N_B=\\infty$). This phenomenon persists even with weaker and more physically realistic assumptions; our results can be appropriately applied to non-GUE Hamiltonians that nevertheless show likely chaotic signatures in their eigenbases. Moreover, we show that with no assumption on how the global state was generated, a $k$-design experiences a degradation in design quality to $k' = \\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor$. This improves upon best prior results on the deep thermalization of designs. Together, our contributions argue for design boosting as a result of chaos and showcase a novel mechanism to generate good designs."}

Encompassing both all-pass and add-drop geometries, identical and distinct pump and biphoton coupling coefficients, and continuous-wave and pulsed pumping, our interaction-picture-based approach reveals time-frequency biphoton correlations while also predicting absolute generation rates. Under continuous-wave excitation, we find critical coupling of both the pump and biphoton to maximize the rate of single photons extracted from the microring, whereas critical coupling of the pump but overcoupling of the biphoton maximize the two-photon rate. Under pulsed pumping, overcoupling of both pump and biphoton (to different degrees) maximizes photon extraction probabilities, albeit under a tradeoff with spectral factorability that we quantify via parameter scans over a range of coupler pairings. As a whole, our formalism should prove valuable for the practical design of integrated photon sources, merging a flexible and intuitive biphoton-centric depiction with quantitative predictions closely tied to experimental parameters."}

Although such phenomena have been demonstrated in non-equilibrium settings, their use for fluctuation engineering has been put forth in Raman-cavity hybrids only recently. In this work, we generalize fluctuation engineering to a multi-mode scenario in which multiple Raman-active modes interact nonlinearly with multiple cavity modes. We demonstrate the emergence of resonant and non-resonant collective fluctuations that can be non-reciprocally controlled by engineering the band dispersion of photons and phonons. As an example we show how Raman fluctuations can be selectively attenuated by tuning the photonic bandgap or even nonresonantly amplified, in marked contrast to the single-mode scenario. We also identify a regime in which the amplification of cavity fluctuations in a specific mode is boosted, surpassing a $\\sqrt{N}$ scaling with increasing number of $N$ Raman and cavity modes. Our study reveals the key role of multi-mode interactions on fluctuations in nonlinear cavity-matter hybrids. Noise engineering through different photon and phonon dispersions, as demonstrated here, could be leveraged for the design of novel quantum sensing platforms and advanced spectroscopy in the THz regime."}

Unlike physical etching, this method preserves the guided-mode profile of the photonic crystal without introducing significant scattering, limiting refractive index perturbations to below 0.001 with 0.01% additional loss. In contrast, physical etching can reduce single-band transmission by more than 30% for an etch width of 100 nm. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach using quantum dots embedded in a glideplane photonic crystal waveguide, controlling the detuning between different spin-state combinations of two highly chiral quantum dots coupled to the same mode. Second-order photon correlation measurements provide a sensitive probe of the chirality-dependent photon statistics, which are in good agreement with a waveguide-QED master equation model. Our results mark an important step towards scalable, multi-emitter architectures for chiral quantum networks."}

By pretraining the Transformer on a diverse dataset of molecules and ansatz types and subsequently fine-tuning it for specific systems, QCML learns transferable mappings between molecular descriptors and PQC parameters, eliminating the need for iterative variational optimization. The pretrained model achieves chemical accuracy in potential energy surfaces, atomic forces, and dipole moments across multiple molecules and ansatzes, and enables efficient AIMD simulations with infrared spectra prediction.

Our approach employs two oblique laser beams and a capillary-array collimation system to address these challenges while maintaining efficient deceleration. For rubidium ($^{87}$Rb), simulations demonstrate a significant increase in the fraction of atoms captured by a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D-MOT) and nearly eliminate atom-induced contamination probability at optical windows, all within a compact Zeeman slower length of 44 cm. Experimental validation with Rb and Yb demonstrates highly efficient atomic loading within the same compact design.

The source is based on the dissociation of solid molecular tritium films below 1 K by electrons from a pulsed RF discharge, a technique recently demonstrated for atomic hydrogen, combined with buffer-gas cooling and magnetic confinement. We analyze the key processes limiting the source performance, adsorption, spin exchange and recombination, and show that atomic tritium fluxes exceeding 1e15 per second at kinetic energies of 100 mK can be achieved at the entrance of a magnetic trap. Such a source would enable Doppler-free two-photon 1S-2S spectroscopy in atomic tritium for high-precision measurements of the triton charge radius, provid- ing a crucial benchmark for bound-state QED and improving the comparison between electronic, muonic, and scattering determinations of nuclear sizes in light systems. Beyond spectroscopy, an atomic tritium source avoids molecular final-state broadening in beta-decay and is therefore neces- sary for next-generation neutrino-mass measurements; combined with detector technologies such as sub-eV resolution quantum sensors or cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, it enables order-of- magnitude improvement compared to the current KATRIN sensitivity, reaching sensitivities below the inverted ordering regime. Additionally, the source can be used to generate a beam of low- field-seeking deuterium atoms for loading magnetic traps, an important benchmark before trapping tritium atoms and useful for precision spectroscopy."}

We formulate the problem of bounding the two-point correlator as a semidefinite programming problem, subject to the constraints of reflection positivity, the Heisenberg equations of motion, and the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition or ground-state positivity. In the dual formulation, the Heisenberg equations of motion become \"inequalities of motion\" on the Lagrange multipliers that enforce the constraints. This enables us to derive rigorous bounds on continuous-time two-point correlators using a finite-dimensional semidefinite or polynomial matrix program. We illustrate this method by bootstrapping the two-point correlators of the ungauged one-matrix quantum mechanics, from which we extract the spectrum and matrix elements of the low-lying adjoint states.
