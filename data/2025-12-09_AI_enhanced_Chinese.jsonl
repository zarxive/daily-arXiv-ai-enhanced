Studying unitaries and their generators from the Lie algebraic perspective has given rise to several algorithms for synthesis based on a Cartan decomposition of the dynamical Lie algebra. For unitaries of the form $e^{-itH}$, such as time-independent Hamiltonian simulation, the resulting circuits have depth that does not depend on simulation time $t$. However, finding such circuits has a large classical overhead in the cost function evaluation and the high dimensional optimization problem. In this work, by further partitioning the dynamical Lie algebra, we break down the optimization problem into smaller independent subproblems. Moreover, the resulting algebraic structure allows us to easily shift the evaluation of the cost function to the quantum computer, further cutting the classical overhead of the algorithm. As an application of the new hybrid algorithm, we synthesize the time evolution unitary for the 4-site transverse field Ising model on several IBM devices and Quantinuum's H1-1 quantum computer.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is a perspective direct timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron beam.\n  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, for ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line corresponding to the duration of electron bunches or beams.

The spacetime around a rotating braneworld black hole is modelled by a Kerr-Newman-like metric determined by its mass $M$, spin $a$, and tidal charge $q$, which encodes the gravitational effects of the bulk spacetime. We consider both inhomogeneous and homogeneous plasma environments characterized by plasma parameters $\u03b1_i$ ($i=1,2\\text{ and }3$) to study light propagation and the interplay of the background spacetime and the plasma environment in influencing the shadow size and shape. We find that as the plasma density increases, inhomogeneous plasma environments decrease the shadow size, however homogeneous plasma enlarges it. On studying the effect due to background spacetime we find that $q<0$ (negative tidal charge) increases the shadow diameter, while $q>0$ decreases it. Using the EHT measurements of M87* and Sgr A*, we constrain the $(q,\u03b1_i)$ parameter space. The EHT data constrains the tidal charge in the range $-1.15 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.45$ for M87* and $-0.65 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.8$ for Sgr A* in the low density plasma limit. As the plasma density increases, the data exhibits a preference towards negative tidal charge for inhomogeneous plasma environments and positive tidal charge for homogeneous plasma environments. Our study reveals that the size of the shadow is primarily governed by the background geometry in presence of low density plasma environments such as that observed in M87* and Sgr A*. However, if supermassive blackholes are surrounded by high density plasma then the shadow size is dictated by both the background metric and the plasma environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u6027\u5f26\u72b6\u4f53\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u8272\u6563\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86 button \u7701_histogram \u6f5c\u529b\u4ee5\u5229\u7528EHT \u76c2\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f26\u72b6\u4f53\u5f15\u529b\u3002\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u8d28\u91cf M\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c a \u548c \u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377 q \u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u548c\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u5f71\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u53d7\u5230\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7EHT \u6d4b\u91cf M87* \u548c Sgr A*\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002EHT\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\uff0c M87*\u548c Sgr A*\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u5728\u5e7f\u57df\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5206\u522b\u4e3a-1.15\u81f30.45\u548c-0.65\u81f30.8\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4ecb\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u548c\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u5982 M87* \u548c Sgr A*\uff0c\u5f71\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u8d85\u7ea7\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u88ab\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ecb\u8d28\u5305\u56f4\uff0c\u5219\u5f71\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e86\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5229\u7528EHT\u7b49\u89c2\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u9650\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5149\u7684\u504f\u8f6c\u548c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7EHT\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u4ecb\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u800c\u5747\u5300\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u8d1f\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5f71\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u6b63\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u5219\u4f1a\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002EHT\u89c2\u6d4b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c M87*\u548c Sgr A*\u5f20\u529b\u7535\u8377\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u5728\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9634\u5f71\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u9634\u5f71\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u4ecb\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically.\n  We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We study the properties of the K$\u03b1$ fluorescence for two different short pulse durations and three X-ray incident energies below and above the K-shell absorption edge, and correlate these with incident fluence estimates based on coherent diffraction. We observe that the incident fluence of the pulse and not its duration, is the main factor that modulates the non-linear response, which leads to an effective shortening of the fluorescence emission.

In a series of previous works, it was shown that in quantum electrodynamics at finite temperature (QED), the description of effects caused by blackbody radiation can be reduced to using the thermal part of the photon propagator. As a consequence of the non-relativistic approximation in the calculation of the thermal one-loop self-energy correction, well-known quantum-mechanical (QM) phenomena emerge at successive orders: the Stark effect arises at leading order in $\u03b1Z$, the Zeeman effect appears in the next-to-leading non-relativistic correction, accompanied by diamagnetic contributions and their relativistic refinements, among other perturbative corrections. The fully relativistic approach used in this work for calculating the SE contribution allows for accurate calculations of the thermal shift of atomic levels, in which all these effects are automatically taken into account. The hydrogen atom serves as the basis for testing a fully relativistic approach to such calculations. Additionally, an analysis is presented of the behavior of the thermal shift caused by the thermal one-loop correction to the self-energy of a bound electron for hydrogen-like ions with an arbitrary nuclear charge $Z$. The significance of these calculations lies in their relevance to contemporary high-precision experiments, where thermal radiation constitutes one of the major contributions to the overall uncertainty budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5176\u73af\u5883\u70ed\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u5bf9\u89c2\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u94fe\u5f0f\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8521\u5854\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728 bulk \u4e2d\u4ece\u5bf9\u6570\u5f8b\u5411\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u8f6c\u6362", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5982\u4f55\u5728 bulk \u4e2d\u53d8\u5316", "method": "\u5229\u7528 2D \u6676\u683c\u81ea\u7531\u8d39\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u70b9\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u73af\u5883\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20", "result": "\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u7cfb\u7edf-\u73af\u5883\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u9075\u5faa\u5bf9\u6570\u5f8b\uff1b\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u9075\u5faa\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5185\u90e8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u8054"}}

This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery.

A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\u03c0$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and N\u00e9el ordered states in the three-color $\u03c0$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger N\u00e9el ordering on the $\u03c0$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and N\u00e9el orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously.

The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source.

Using a local orthonormal operator basis, we recast this construction in terms of a generalized response tensor. Building on this, we introduce a generalized spacetime density kernel (GSDK) corresponding to higher-point correlation functions, including time-ordered as well as out-of-time-ordered correlators.

In GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias.

We derive an upper bound on net primary productivity (NPP) from non-equilibrium thermodynamics and information theory, given a planet's usable free-energy flux and a few coarse-grained biological parameters. The bound subtracts an irreducible power cost of heritable information processing -- set by global template-copying rates, copying fidelity, alphabet size, and proofreading work -- from the planetary power budget before converting the remainder into biomass. This yields an ``information-productivity trade-off'': at fixed planetary power, higher copying rates, lower error rates, larger alphabets, or more intensive proofreading all lower the ceiling on biomass production. Using conservative parameter choices, we show that Earth lies well below this ceiling, whereas low-flux environments such as M-dwarf habitable zones and subsurface ocean worlds can be driven into an information-limited regime where only modest combinations of productivity and heritable complexity are attainable.

However, the fully etched rings of conventional CBGs restrict the implementation of charge and Stark tuning via electrical contacts. To overcome this limitation, a labyrinth CBG geometry with four bridges has been proposed, yet the added bridges significantly degraded optical performance. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that a periodic labyrinth CBG design preserves both high coupling efficiency and strong Purcell enhancement while enabling electrical integration if optimized after introducing the bridges. We show three optimized designs at emission wavelengths of 780 nm, 930 nm, and 1550 nm, because these wavelengths are among the most relevant for quantum dots and show the general applicability of our approach. At all three wavelengths collection efficiencies exceeding 90% into a numerical aperture of 0.7 and Purcell factors greater than 25 are achieved. Furthermore, we propose a device layout incorporating a barrier layer that separates p- and n-doped semiconductor regions, which is incorporated to prevent tunneling of one of the charge carriers for selective charging. Also this design can be reoptimized to retain the performance of a device without tunnel barrier. These results establish labyrinth CBGs as a platform for electrically tunable quantum dot single-photon sources with high efficiency and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Practical and robust explicitly-correlated F12 methods require the use of standard or specialized atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that include diffuse AOs, even for neutral species. Although modern reduced-scaling formulations of explicitly-correlated many-body methods have become routinely applicable to molecules with hundreds of atoms, application of F12 methods to large molecular systems can be severely hampered due to the onset of ill-conditioning spurred by the presence of diffuse AOs in the F12-appropriate orbital basis sets. Here we re-examine why diffuse AOs are necessary for application of F12 methods. To help such an investigation, we developed a dual-basis formulation of traditional and F12 coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods in which the reference (occupied) and correlating (virtual) orbitals are expanded in separate AO basis sets. Our conclusion is that diffuse AOs are fundamentally important for the traditional (non-F12) description of dynamical correlation; the necessity of diffuse AOs in F12 calculations arises indirectly due to the dramatic reduction of the basis set error by the F12 terms such that the error due to the lack of diffuse AOs becomes comparable to the residual basis set incompleteness. The dual-basis CC methods are suggested as an important candidate formalism for accurate (in particular, F12) reduced-scaling many-body methods in extended systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The dipolar atomic species have permanent magnetic dipolar moments. We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution.

Achieving these capabilities in practical systems increasingly demands chip-scale integration of THz photonic components that are typically bulky. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a unique platform for integrated nonlinear photonics in the visible and near-infrared regimes, and extending this framework into the THz domain would constitute a significant advance. Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz.

However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\\rm\u03a9$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders.

Early NPD measurements on the monoclinic phase Cr$_3$Te$_4$ ($x=0.5$) presented evidence for competing FM and AFM phases. Here we apply neutron diffraction to a single crystal of Cr$_{3+\u03b4}$Te$_4$ with $\u03b4=-0.10$ and discover that it consists of two distinct monoclinic phases, one with FM order below $T_{\\rm C} \\approx 321$ K and another that develops AFM order below $T_{\\rm N} \\approx 86$ K. In contrast, we find that a crystal with $\u03b4=-0.26$ exhibits only FM order. The single-crystal analysis is complemented by results obtained with NPD, XPD, and TEM measurements on the $\u03b4=-0.10$ composition. From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\\rm C}$ and $T_{\\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions. Correlations between the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments with lattice parameter variation demonstrate that the magnetic orders are sensitive to strain, thus explaining why magnetic ordering temperatures and anisotropies can be different between bulk and thin-film samples, when the latter are subject to epitaxial strain.

Magnetic magnetostriction and Sandbox SEM observations support the presence of two phases, likely formed via spinodal decomposition.

The challenge of scattering and coupling suppression is holistically addressed across the wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is developed to mitigate high-frequency scattering and coupling while maintaining low-frequency radiation performance. Compared with a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral achieves a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, the segmented-spiral dipole achieves impedance matching in the low band (LB, 3.05-4.68 GHz, 42.2%), covering the 5G band (3.3-4.2 GHz), while additional suppressors further reduce cross-band coupling. The middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate at 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G bands (6.425-15.35 GHz). Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure to avoid common-mode resonances within the LB and MB and to minimize cross-band scattering in the HB. The proposed array maintains undistorted radiation patterns and better than 20 dB port isolation between any two ports across all three bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We present an innovative methodology on the label-free and high-resolution imaging properties of phase holotomographic microscopy coupled with neural network models for the classification of cancer cells.

EfficientNet-B0 achieved 96.9 % accuracy on unsegmented images. Refractive index analysis revealed bimodal distribution in treated cells, reflecting heterogeneous biophysical responses to paclitaxel exposure and supporting the network's ability to detect subtle, label-free indicators of drug action.

In DQC, after partitioning quantum circuits, they must be scheduled and executed on heterogenous QPUs while balancing latency, overhead, QPU communication resource limits. However, since fully functioning quantum communication networks have not been realized yet, near-term quantum clouds will only rely on local operations and classical communication settings between QPUs, without entangled quantum links. Additionally, existing DQC scheduling frameworks do not account for user-defined execution deadlines and adopt inefficient wire cutting techniques. Accordingly, in this work, a deadline aware DQC scheduling framework with efficient wire cutting for near-term quantum cloud is proposed. The proposed framework schedules partitioned quantum subcircuits while accounting for circuit deadlines and QPU capacity limits. It also captures dependencies between partitioned subcircuits and distributes the execution of the sampling shots on different QPUs to have efficient wire cutting and faster execution. In this regard, a deadline-aware circuit scheduling optimization problem is formulated, and solved using simulated annealing. Simulation results show a marked improvement over existing shot-agnostic frameworks under urgent deadlines, reaching a 12.8% increase in requests served before their deadlines. Additionally, the proposed framework serves 8.16% more requests, on average, compared to state-of-the-art dependency-agnostic baseline frameworks, and by 9.60% versus the dependency-and-shot-agnostic baseline, all while achieving a smaller makespan of the DQC execution.

Hot-charge emission spectroscopy (HotES) probes ELA by injecting ballistic carriers across a tunneling oxide. Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u5dee\u5206\u52a0\u70ed\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\uff08sd-HotES\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u80fd\u5e26\u80fd\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u9690\u85cf\u5cf0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u6742\u5316\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u7535\u8377\u6ce8\u5165\u9608\u503c\uff08ELA\uff09\u5728 buried interfaces \u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5668\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u5dee\u5206\u52a0\u70ed\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u623f\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u901a\u9053\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u901a\u9053\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "sd-HotES \u5728\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u96be\u4ee5\u7528\u4f20\u7edf HotES \u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5cf0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u6b65\u5dee\u5206\u70ed\u5149\u8c31\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u95f4\u754c\u9762\u548c\u6742\u5316\u5668\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570 $w$ \u5728 $z\textsim0.5$ \u65f6\u4ece $w<-1$ \u8fc5\u901f\u5411 $w>-1$ \u8de8\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7_scalar\u2013Einstein\u2013Gauss\u2013Bonnet_\u5f15\u529b\u548c ghost-free $f(\boldsymbol{\tau})$ \u5f15\u529b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8c8c\u4f3cphantom \u8de8\u8d8a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51cf\u901f\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u6162\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86 DESI \u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5728\u8c8c\u4f3cphantom \u8de8\u8d8a\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5373_scalar\u2013Einstein\u2013Gauss\u2013Bonnet_\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7c92\u5b50\u662f\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u3002\u8be5\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u4e0e Gauss\u2013Bonnet \u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u8026\u5408\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u66f4\u7f13\u6162\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6700\u540e\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9006phantom \u8de8\u8d8a\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u4ece\u51cf\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u5411\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u6709\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6f14\u5316-curiosity-driven\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5982DESI\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u5bfb\u6c42\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u73b0\u884c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec_scalar\u2013Einsten\u2013Gauss\u2013Bonnet_\u548c ghost-free $f(\boldsymbol{\tau})$ \u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8c8c\u4f3cphantom \u8de8\u8d8a\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7c92\u5b50-\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86DESI\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728INVPhantom crossing\u548capparent Phamomcrossing\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u91caDESI\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Working in the limit of a large number of physical scalars and using dimensional regularization, it was shown that the scattering amplitude had a pole corresponding to a graviton exchange, provided that a certain fine-tuning was implemented; the Planck mass was determined as a function of the dimensional regularization parameter and a mass scale. Here we demonstrate that the presence of the composite graviton is a robust feature of this model and not an artefact of the choice of regulator, by replacing dimensional regularization with Pauli-Villars fields.

Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65\u00b0 and 5\u00b0, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases.

In this formulation, the fermion-soliton energy is proportional to the soliton's topological charge. We show that fermionic back-reaction and the self-interacting scalar critically shape the fermion-kink energy, the in-gap bound-state spectrum, and the fermionic vacuum-polarization energy, yielding well-defined stability minima of the total energy as functions of the fermion and scalar masses and coupling parameters. A key result is that the Heun-equation formalism is necessary to construct nonzero-energy bound and scattering states: unlike the tau-function method, which captures only the zero mode, the Heun approach encodes the full scattering data through local solution matching conditions.

Even when feasible to be applied, purely data-driven models lack thermodynamic consistency in their predictions and are not a reliable solution. This work introduces ExPUFFIN, an extended version of the Path-unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network, consisting of a hybrid GNN-based framework that directly predicts temperature-dependent viscosities of pure hydrocarbons from molecular graphs, while enforcing mechanistic inductive biases in the output layer to ensure thermodynamic consistency. Molecular information is given as graph structures, encoded as a graph convolutional network, and mapped to an inductive bias neuron based on two thermophysical correlations:a three-parameter Andrade-type equation and a four-parameter empirical viscosity-temperature relation. The accuracy of these models is compared with a solely data-driven prediction. The Andrade-based ExPUFFIN variant reduces RMSE compared to the purely data-driven baseline of 37 percent and yields smooth, physically consistent interpolation and extrapolation of viscosity-temperature curves, properties that are not observed in purely data-driven models.

Furthermore, these coincidence detection techniques will offer powerful new methods to investigate novel phenomena like itinerant magnetism and electronic nematicity in quantum materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742Many-body\u5173\u8054\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528 coincidence\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7c92\u5b50-\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u7c92\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u5f00\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u672a\u89e3\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u590d\u6742Many-body\u5173\u8054\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86coincidence\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u539f\u7406\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u524d\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528coincidence\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u96be\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \\ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution.

Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability.

We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~\u03bc\\mathrm{T}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

In our setting, the center of mass degree of freedom of the atoms plays the role of a photon or phonon mode, while the interacting, relative mode acts as a qubit. No internal state is involved in our system, which makes this motional qubit robust to spin-dependent noise. We show that a universal set of bosonic operations, including displacement, rotation, squeezing, and the corresponding set of gates controlled by the qubit, can be implemented through precise temporal modulation of the optical tweezers.

However, the output power of a single magnetron is limited by its resonant cavities, posing a physical constraint. High-efficiency coherent power combining based on the injection-locking technique effectively overcomes this limitation and meets the demand for higher output power. Nevertheless, using isolators, such as circulators, introduces significant insertion loss, and the injection signal sources and phase shifters increase the system size, cost, and complexity in a conventional magnetron power combining (MPC) system. A novel method is proposed to utilize the coupling between two ports of an H-plane tee to achieve peer-to-peer injection locking magnetrons. Meanwhile, an asymmetric phase compensation is realized using a section of waveguide to adjust the magnetron output characteristics. Theoretical and numerical analyses provided qualitative insight into the system output behavior. Subsequently, an experimental system was developed for verification. In the experiments, the system achieved maximum microwave power combining efficiencies 90.2%, 93.6%, and 93.6% at electrical waveguide lengths corresponding to 90, 135, and 225, with output powers of 1650, 1260, and 1610 W, respectively, without the use of any isolators or external injection sources. The experimental results show good agreement with numerical calculations.

Two practical schemes, termed IP/EA-UCC3 and IP/EA-qUCCSD, are developed and implemented within the UCC singles and doubles (UCCSD) framework using the perturbative and commutator-based truncation strategy for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\\bar{H}$. The numerical performance of these UCC-based EPT methods is extensively evaluated against full configuration interaction (FCI) reference data and compared with established approaches, including IP/EA-ADC(3), IP/EA-ADC(4) and IP/EA-EOM-CCSD. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that IP-qUCCSD achieves the highest overall accuracy among Hermitian ionized-state methods for one-hole (1h)-dominated IPs of closed-shell systems, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.19 eV and standard deviation (SD) of 0.13 eV. Remarkably, despite the absence of triple-excitation contributions, IP-qUCCSD outperforms the higher-order ADC(4) method.

In particular, electron or hole doping of the sample layer is heralded by a strong frequency shift and loss of transition strength of 2s excitons in the sensor layer; these features have been attributed to the formation of a bound state of a 2s exciton and a remote electron. Through a theoretical analysis of exciton-electron scattering, we show that the experimental spectra can only be explained by electron-mediated hybridization of 2s, 2p and interlayer excitons, leading to a new type of many-body state which we term Rydberg attractive polaron.

Due to the self-imaging phenomenon, the SMS structure - formed by splicing a no-core fiber between two singlemode fibers -, provides a broad spectral peak whose central wavelength position is sensitive to variations in the refractive index of the medium surrounding the fiber. In turn, thanks to the in-series SMS-FPI configuration, the sensor's reflection spectrum exhibits the SMS spectral signature modulated by FPI fringes. This readily allows for reducing the width of the spectral features monitored during the sensing measurements, thus enhancing the capabilities of adequately resolving the corresponding spectral shifts. The FPIs reported in this investigation have been fabricated by using two different methods, namely by forming an air-gap FPI between the cleaved ends of two singlemode optical fibers, and by casting a polymeric film onto a connectorized fiber end tip. In the first configuration, the distance between the two cleaved fiber ends could be varied to tune the FPI's free spectral range, hence allowing for tailoring the widths of the spectral oscillations to be monitored during the sensing measurements. Alternatively, the second configuration, while avoiding the use of motorized translation stages, provides a more versatile option for applications.

Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking.

We further extend our analysis to investigate the entanglement entropy of corresponding intervals in ICFT$_2$s dual to bulk Janus deformed BTZ black hole and AdS$_3$ black string geometries obtaining consistent results from both the field theoretic and bulk computations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53ccboost\u5355\u533a\u95f4\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\u5728\u754c\u9762\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\uff08ICFT\u2082\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u8bba\u4e0eJanus\u53d8\u5f62\u7684AdS\u2083\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u5305\u62ecPoincar\u00e9 AdS\u2083\u3001BTZ\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548cAdS\u2083\u9ed1\u8272\u7ef3\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6280\u672f\uff08replica technique\uff09\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5171\u5f62\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\u548cJanus\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u5348\u7ebf\u5173\u7cfb\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7eaf\u970d\u4f4d\u5c14\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\uff08holographic entanglement entropy\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0e\u573a\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86Janus\u53d8\u5f62\u7684AdS\u2083\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548cAdS\u2083\u9ed1\u8272\u7ef3\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4ecd\u7136\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u53ccboost\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u970d\u4f4d\u5c14\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u590d\u5236\u6280\u672f\uff08replica technique\uff09\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5355\u533a\u95f4\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728AdS\u2082\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u5f62\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u53ccboost\u6548\u5e94\u7eb3\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5b50\u5348\u7ebf\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97Holographic Entanglement Entropy\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e Janus \u53d8\u5f62\u7684 AdS3 \u80cc\u666f\uff08\u5305\u62ecPoincar\u00e9 AdS3\u3001BTZ\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548cAdS3\u9ed1\u8272\u7ef3\uff09\uff0c\u53ccboost\u5355\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b50\u5348\u7ebf\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u7eaf\u970d\u4f4d\u5c14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8fd9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u970d\u4f4d\u5c14\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ccboost\u5355\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u592b\u7405\u79be\u8d39\u71b5\u5728\u754c\u9762\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u53ccboost\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u53ccboost\u6548\u5e94\u548cAdS/CFT\u5bf9\u5076\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moir\u00e9 superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range.

This approach extends previous single plane-wave mode treatments to realistic pulse configurations, resolving conceptual inconsistencies arising from non-normalizable infinite plane waves and establishing consistency between analytical and numerical methods. We derive a correction factor that quantifies deviations from the single-mode approximation and show that it remains below $10^{-4}$ for intensities typical of HHG ($\\sim 10^{14}~$W/cm$^2$). This result confirms that free-space HHG driven by any quantum state of light is accurately described by averaging semi-classical calculations over the Husimi distribution, with no observable genuine quantum effects. The absence of such effects is attributed to the large photon numbers ($\\sim 10^{11}$) required to reach HHG intensities in free space, which render quantum fluctuations negligible.

These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles.

By correlating two sequences of heterodyne spectra produced by mixing a test laser with a pair of optical combs, DCCS enables rapid (e.g., 1 us) and high-resolution (0.08 pm) spectral retrieval over broad optical bandwidths. Leveraging these capabilities, we reveal mode-hopping and mode-competition dynamics in continuous-wave lasers, as well as the buildup process of a mode-locked laser.

The latter constitutes the first direct measurement of a nuclear recoil line induced by multi-$\u03b3$ cascades. It is predicted by our simulations when the recoiling nucleus has time to stop before the emission of the next $\u03b3$-ray in the cascade.

Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration.

One of the most employed methods to reduce leakage includes the installation of pressurereducing valves along the water distribution network and the utilization of pressure management schemes. Pressure management includes different types of control models, which are applied according to the requirements of each site. The most advanced and sophisticated scheme is critical point control, which relies on a flow signal from a measuring device or online communication between the critical point and the valve. This paper proposes the utilization of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, or the SARIMA model, to correlate pressure at the outlet of the valve and pressure on the critical point of the area supplied, aiming to set a fixed pressure in the critical point. The SARIMA model is developed according to historical data logged in the field and then validated. Later, the SARIMA model was tested on a real location in the village of Noja, Spain. The analysis of the field test results prove that the proposed model is feasible to be used since there is no significance difference between the target values set in the critical point and the real values measured in the field.

Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly quantum linear system solvers, offer promising avenues to accelerate the most computationally intensive steps of IPMs. However, practical challenges such as quantum error, hardware noise, and sensitivity to poorly conditioned systems remain significant obstacles.

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12.

However, because LCU generally requires an ancillary system and complex controlled unitary operators, it is not regarded as a hardware-efficient routine. Recently, a randomized LCU implementation with many applications to early FTQC algorithms has been proposed that computes the same expectation values as the original LCU algorithm using a shallower quantum circuit with a single ancilla qubit, at the cost of a quadratically larger sampling overhead. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm intermediate between the original and randomized LCU that manages the tradeoff between sampling cost and the circuit size. Our algorithm divides the set of unitary operators into several groups and then randomly samples LCU circuits from these groups to evaluate the target expectation value. Notably, we analytically prove an underlying monotonicity: larger group sizes entail smaller sampling overhead, by introducing a quantity called the reduction factor, which determines the sampling overhead across all grouping strategies. Our hybrid algorithm not only enables substantial reductions in circuit depth and ancilla-qubit usage while nearly maintaining the sampling overhead of LCU-based non-Hermitian dynamics simulators, but also achieves intermediate scaling between virtual and coherent quantum linear system solvers. It further provides a virtual ground-state preparation scheme that requires only a resettable single-ancilla qubit and asymptotically shows advantages in both virtual and coherent LCU methods. Finally, by viewing quantum error detection as an LCU process, our approach clarifies when conventional and virtual detection should be applied selectively, thereby balancing sampling and hardware overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "A quantum algorithm that balances the tradeoff between the depth and the sampling overhead of the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) method.", "motivation": "Quantum algorithms require optimizing tradeoffs between circuit complexity and sampling efficiency, especially for resource-sensitive applications.", "method": "The algorithm groups unitaries and randomly samples LCU circuits, analyzing the reduction factor to minimize overhead.", "result": "Reduces circuit depth and ancilla qubits while maintaining sampling efficiency, with applications in quantum linear systems and error detection.", "conclusion": "Balances LCU approaches for improved quantum computing efficiency."}}

By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r>0$ and $r<0$) of the spacetime.\n  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.\n  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.\n  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The effectiveness of this solution is shown by achieving perfect coupling and a system detection efficiency as high as 41.0% at a wavelength of 561 nm, which is the highest value reported to date among both heterogeneous/hybrid integrated and directly coupled systems. We also show the robustness of the coupling to misalignments, demonstrating that costly alignment procedures are not needed. Finally, we exploit the SPAD array to characterize a reconfigurable Mach-Zehnder interferometer, i.e., the basic building block of multimode reconfigurable PICs. This solution provides a new avenue to the design and implementation of quantum photonics experiments, especially effective when compact and cost-efficient systems are needed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of < 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the case of weak disorder, the orbital relaxation time is proportional to the momentum scattering time: each scattering event contributes to destroying the orbital moment.

The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes an advanced tri-band shared-aperture antenna array optimized for 5G and 6G communication systems.", "motivation": "The development of efficient multi-band antennas is essential for improving the performance of next-generation cellular networks.", "method": "The authors developed a segmented spiral radiator combined with resonators and characteristic mode analysis to address interference suppression across multiple frequency bands.", "result": "The antenna exhibits low radar cross-section, effective impedance matching, and clean radiation patterns across the targeted frequency ranges.", "conclusion": "The proposed antenna array provides reliable operation for 5G-Advanced and 6G centimeter bands, significantly enhancing network performance."}}

The discrete classification agrees with a continuous mean-squared acceleration scale and correlates with a coherence measure given by the ratio of coherence length to the initial packet width $L_\u03c6(t)/\u03c3_0$. We identify a broad Planckian domain in which the dimensionless diffusivity $\u03b1\\!=\\!Dm/\\hbar$ is of order unity and only weakly depends on the parameters.

Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for constructing the necessary potential energy surfaces, but applying it to excited states faces a fundamental barrier: the cost of generating high-level quantum chemistry data. We overcome this challenge by developing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that achieve multi-state multi-reference perturbation theory accuracy through various techniques, such as transfer, multi-state, and $\u0394$-learning. Applied to the methaniminium cation, our highest-fidelity transfer-learning model uncovers its complete photodissociation landscape following S$_2$ photoexcitation. The comprehensive XMCQDPT2/SA(3)-CASSCF(12,12) electronic structure description captures all competing decay channels, including S$_1$ branching into photoisomerization and direct H$_2$-loss pathways. Our results show that the population dynamics generally depends on the MLIP model, correlating with its performance. At the same time, the introduction of MLIP-uncertainty corrections based on the predictions of an ensemble of models brings different approaches into agreement, validating this metric as essential for reliable dynamics. To interpret the population dynamics, we introduce a wavepacket oscillation model - a mechanistically transparent, power-law kinetics framework that extracts state-specific lifetimes directly from first-principles simulations. The model quantitatively reproduces the ultrafast decay, creating a direct link between quantum transition probabilities and classical rate constants. The kinetic fits yield channel-specific lifetimes, supporting the recently discovered photochemical pathway mediated by a novel $\u03c3\u03c0^*/S_0$ conical intersection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u514b\u670d\u9ad8\u9636\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u80fd\u66f2\u9762\uff08MLIPs\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u591a\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u0394\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6001\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u52bf\u80fd\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eMLIP\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7532\u70f7\u7fb0\u9634\u79bb\u5b50\u5728S\u2082\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e0b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u79bb\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u9762\u56fe\u666f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7XMCQDPT2/SA(3)-CASSCF(12,12)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u5149\u89e3\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u79bb\u9014\u5f84\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u80fd\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5f62\u6210\u7684MLIP-\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u5305\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8fc7\u6e21\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u03c3\u03c0*/S\u2080\u4ea4\u70b9\u7684\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Previous studies of black hole superradiance have often treated bosonic fields classically, leaving open questions about how particles are produced and how the clouds grow over time. In this work, we canonically quantize a massive scalar field around a Kerr black hole, providing a fully quantum description of black hole superradiance. We show that the evolution of the particle number in the cloud, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the scalar field, can be consistently explained within the standard framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we prove that the growth of the cloud occurs independently of the choice of initial state. We also explore several phenomena related to a massive scalar field in a rotating black hole spacetime, including Hawking radiation, adiabatic backreaction on the black hole spin, and the direction of level transitions in the presence of self-interactions of the field. Our analysis provides a consistent quantum-mechanical perspective that includes all these phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63 hole \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5149\u5fae\u8154\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7c7b\u6781iton\u3001\u6781iton\u548c\u5149\u7c7b\u6781iton\u5171\u805a\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u53d7\u9650 Hartree-Fock \u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7ec4\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50 Many-Body \u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u5fae\u8154\u4e2d\u591a\u4f53\u5bf9\u5149\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6781iton \u5171\u805a\u6001\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u53d7\u9650 Hartree-Fock \u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u5e26\u7535\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63 hole \u548c\u5149\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u51cf\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u65e0\u5e8f\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63 hole-\u5149\u6001\u5411\u6781\u6027\u7c7b\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u5404\u4e2a\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u5149\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u6fc0\u53d1\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6781\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5149\u5fae\u8154\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u591a\u6781\u5b50\u548c\u591a\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ec6\u8282\u3002"}}

Submitted to PoS", "summary": "Recent algorithmic improvements have made it possible to evaluate subdivergence-free (=primitive=skeleton) Feynman integrals in $\u03c6^4$ theory numerically up to 18 loops. By now, all such integrals up to 13 loops and several hundred thousand at higher loop order have been computed. This data enables a statistical analysis of the typical behaviour of Feynman integrals at large loop order. We find that the average value grows exponentially, but the observed growth rate is accurately described by its leading asymptotics only upwards of 25 loops. This is in contrast with the $N$-dependence of the $ON(N)$-symmetric $\u03c6^4$ theory, which is close to its large-order asymptotics already around 10 loops.\n  Secondly, the distribution of integrals has a largely continuous inner part but a few extreme outliers. This makes uniform random sampling inefficient. We find that the value of the integral is correlated with many features of the graph, which can be used for importance sampling. With a naive test implementation we obtained an approximately 1000-fold speedup compared with uniform sampling. This suggests that in future work, Feynman amplitudes at large loop order might be computed numerically with statistical methods, rather than through enumerating and evaluating every individual

Using a momentum-space lattice model and linear-response theory, we investigate a $d$-wave altermagnet coupled to a topological insulator and highlight the crucial role of spin-flip tunneling in shaping its electronic and transport properties. Interfacial hybridization strongly modifies the band structure, leading to anisotropic Rashba-Edelstein and Hall responses. The spin-flip component of the coupling induces an inverse $d$-wave spin texture in the altermagnetic bands, signaling the onset of an altermagnetic topological phase. This coupling also renders the Rashba-Edelstein effect strongly in-plane anisotropic, enhancing the transverse response relative to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic analogues.

To improve rectification efficiency, Schottky diodes, which are sensitive to low power, are commonly selected as rectifying devices to convert microwave power into dc power. However, low-power rectifying diodes typically have low reverse breakdown voltages, making them susceptible to reverse breakdown under high power conditions. This letter proposes a low-power rectifier with reconfigurable function. The rectifying diode is connected in parallel with the p-i-n diode. At low input power, the output dc voltage is low, and the p-i-n diode remains off, having no impact on the rectifier operation. As the input power increases, the p-i-n diode turns on, causing change in circuit structure and impedance mismatch. This leads to increased reflected power, thereby preventing the rectifying diode from receiving excessive power. In addition, the turn-on voltage of the p-i-n diode is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage of the rectifying diode, protecting it from reverse breakdown.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u7535\u78c1\u80fd harvesting \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 PIN \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u548c Schottky \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u5e76\u8054\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9006\u53d8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u78c1\u80fd harvesting \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 PIN \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u548c Schottky \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u5e76\u8054\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPIN \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u7684\u5f00\u901a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53cd\u5c04\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86 Schottky \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u514d\u53d7\u53cd\u5411\u51fb\u7a7f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u7535\u78c1\u80fd harvesting \u9006\u53d8\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 PIN \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u7684\u5f00\u901a\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53cd\u5411\u529f\u7387\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86 Schottky \u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u3002"}}

Telecom-band spin-photonic qubits, operating in the 1260-1675 nm wavelength range, are particularly well-suited for long-distance quantum communication due to minimal loss in standard optical fibers. Achieving scalability, however, hinges on fulfilling several stringent criteria: coherent spin-state control, deterministic and indistinguishable single-photon emission, and integration with nanophotonic structures that enhance radiative properties, such as lifetime, coherence, and photon indistinguishability. This study explores the state-of-the-art spin-photonic qubits across solid-state platforms, including diamond color centers, silicon carbide defect centers, quantum dots, and two-dimensional materials. Special attention is given to silicon-based emitters, particularly G, T, C- and Ci-centers, which promise monolithic integration with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and telecom-band operation. We classify these systems based on spin-photon interface availability, CMOS process compatibility, and emitter scalability. We also discuss recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), including Purcell enhancement and quality factor engineering in integrated photonic (circuits) environments. The work highlights emerging demonstrations of quantum networking over metropolitan scales and outlines the trajectory toward chip-scale quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs).

In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\u03bc\\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter.

In this work, we investigate the Maxwell--Klein--Gordon system constrained to curved surfaces and demonstrate that the geometric potential $\u03a3_{\\mathrm{geom}}(\\mathbf{r})$ acts as a local renormalization environment. We show that extrinsic curvature modifies the scalar loop spectrum, entering the vacuum polarization as a position-dependent mass correction $M^2(\\mathbf{r}) \\to m^2 + \u03a3_{\\mathrm{geom}}(\\mathbf{r})$. This induces a finite, gauge-invariant ``geometry-induced running'' of the electromagnetic response. In the long-wavelength regime ($|{\\bf Q}|R \\ll 1$), we derive a closed-form expression for the relative frequency shift $\u0394\u03c9/\u03c9$, governed by the overlap between the electric energy density and the geometric potential. Applying this formalism to Gaussian bumps, cylindrical shells, and tori, we identify distinct spectral signatures that distinguish these quantum loop corrections from classical geometric optics.

Lie-algebraic central extensions naturally generalise to $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions, which in turn classify branes in superstring theory via the brane bouquet. This paper classifies all $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions of all kinematical Lie algebras that do not depend on the spatial rotation generators as well as all iterated central extensions thereof (for codimensions $\\le3$). The Bargmann central extension of the Galilean algebra then appears as merely one term in a sequence of $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree; a similar situation obtains for the Newton-Hooke algebra and the static algebra, but not for the Carrollian algebra nor those kinematical Lie algebras that are not Wigner-\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc deformations of a simple algebra.\n  The sequence of $L_\\infty$-algebraic central extensions in each degree then corresponds to a tower of $p$-form fields. After imposing conventional constraints, the zero-form field provides absolute time, and the higher-form fields are certain wedge products of the field strengths of the one-form (Bargmann) gravitational field. These then provide natural $(p-1)$-brane couplings to the corresponding non-Lorentzian gravities, which are found to produce velocity-dependent gravitational effects in the presence of torsion. The $L_\\infty$-algebraic cocycles also provide Wess-Zumino-Witten terms for the $(p-1)$-brane action, which require the introduction of doubled spatial coordinates that are reminiscent of double field theory, but which (in some cases at least, and given appropriate kinetic terms) do not result in doubled physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC.

For the semi-open system, a partially reflective wall is added around the event horizon. Three aspects of this model are investigated, namely the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra, the greybody factor (GF), and the exceptional point (EP). For the QNM aspect, we identify three distinct behaviors as the frequency-independent reflectivity $\\mathcal{K}$ increasing. The first-type modes approach the real axis and form long-lived quasi-bound states. The second-type modes move toward but do not reach the real axis and retain a finite decay rate. The third-type modes eventually lie on the imaginary axis becoming purely decaying modes. For the GF aspect, GFs exhibit strong oscillations controlled by the distance between the potential and the reflective wall with a real constant reflectivity. In contrast, a Boltzmann-type reflectivity produces only small corrections. Finally, by promoting $\\mathcal{K}$ to a complex parameter, the modified boundary conditions give rise to a second-order EP. Parameterizing the vicinity of such EP, we observe the mode exchange phenomenon, and the deviation of spectra scale with the square root of the deviation of the parameter, as predicted by a Puiseux series expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These constraints limit the use of microendoscopes in clinical settings such as early cancer detection within narrow, hard-to-access anatomical regions, including the lung, ovaries, and pancreas. State-of-the-art microendoscopes typically rely on microlens assemblies that increase both cost and size. Their large f-numbers also hinder the collection of high-resolution information from live tissue. In this work, we present two compact metalens designs that provide wide FOV, extended DOF, and high resolution, enabled by custom-tailored point spread functions (PSFs). The devices achieve a full 172 degrees FOV, an extended DOF from 0.4 mm to beyond 300 mm, and a resolution of 30 line pairs per millimeter, all within a 1 mm x 1 mm x 0.2 mm footprint.

Conical spirals and related structures possess intrinsic in-plane directionalities governed by phase factors $\u03c6_0$, which are often obscured in long spirals due to cylindrical symmetry but become prominent in short spirals or thin films. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically studied magnetic textures at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI), including 1D and 2D FCIs with various shapes. Surface spirals (SS) emerge adjacent to these FCIs, closely linked to the cone's in-plane reorientation. In 1D FCIs, reorientation controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of the SS, with a discontinuity point observed where spirals with opposite charges form on opposite sides. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices.

Our formulation allows us to pose the characteristic initial value problem and to establish several properties of solutions. More precisely, we work in generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates and prescribe initial data on an asymptotically Euclidean, future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry, and we identify the precise regularity conditions required at the center. Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature. In deriving this reduced two-equation system, we identify the regularity conditions at the center of symmetry and impose natural assumptions on the scalar-field potential and on the function f(R) governing the gravitational Lagrangian density. As an application, we prove the monotonicity of the Hawking mass in this setting and formally analyze the singular limit in which the integrand f(R) of the action approaches R, corresponding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, the formulation isolates the essential evolution and constraint content on the future domain of dependence of two null hypersurfaces and is designed to facilitate subsequent advances in geometric analysis and robust numerical simulations of spherical collapse in modified gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper derives and analyzes the field equations in f(R) gravity for a spherically symmetric scalar field, establishing a first-order system for global evolution with generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates.

Each member of the desired group of T unique transformations is encoded and addressed with a distinct 2D illumination phase profile, termed \"phase key\", which illuminates the input aperture, activating the corresponding transformation at the output field-of-view. A common diffractive optical network, optimized with T phase keys, demultiplexes these encoded inputs and accurately executes any of the T distinct linear transformations at its output. We demonstrate that a diffractive network composed of N = 2 x T x Ni x No optimized diffractive features can realize T distinct complex-valued linear transformations, accurately executed for any complex field at the input aperture, where Ni and No refer to the input/output pixels, respectively. In our proof-of-concept numerical analysis, T = 512 complex-valued transformations are implemented by the same monochrome diffractive network with negligible error using illumination phase diversity. Compared with wavelength-multiplexed diffractive systems, phase-multiplexing architecture significantly lowers the transformation errors, potentially enabling larger-scale optical transformations to be implemented through a monochrome processor.

The emitted particles from BHs interact with the thermal background and thermalize, leading to a modification in the Hawking radiation spectrum. By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries.

So far, investigations of NH topology have been restricted to EPs of the NH Hamiltonian, which governs the system dynamics conditional upon no quantum jumps occurring. The Liouvillian superoperator, which combines the effects of quantum jumps with NH Hamiltonian dynamics, possesses EPs (LEPs) that are significantly different from those of the corresponding NH Hamiltonian. We here study the topological features of the LEPs in the system consisting of a qubit coupled to a non-Markovian reservoir. We find that two distinct winding numbers can be simultaneously produced by executing a single closed path encircling the twofold LEP2, formed by two coinciding LEP2s, each involving a pair of coalescing eigenvectors of the extended Liouvillian superoperator.

After general considerations on the significance of tests of the WEP using quantum states and the need for considering inertial and gravitational masses as operators, we develop a model to derive the matrix elements of the free-fall operator, showing that the variance of the acceleration operator, in addition to its mean, enables estimation of violations of the WEP due to quantum coherence in a way that is robust with respect to shot-to-shot fluctuations. Building on this analysis, we demonstrate how the validity of the WEP may be tested in a torsion balance setup, by accessing the mean and variance of a torque operator we introduce and quantize. Due to the long acquisition times of the signal as compared to the timescale on which coherent superposition states may survive, we further propose a dynamical setting, where the torsion balance is subject to a time-dependent gravitational field, and measurements of angular acceleration encode possible violations of the WEP.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Bolokhov"], "title": "Revisiting black holes in dark-matter halos: on consistent solutions to the Einstein equations", "comment": "7 pages, 1 table", "summary": "A number of recent papers have claimed to construct solutions of Einstein's equations describing black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos with empirically motivated density profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White, Burkert, Einasto, pseudo-isothermal, and solitonic distributions. We show that the approach used to obtain many of these metrics generically does not lead to the correct solutions to the Einstein equations for the matter sources they purport to represent. This issue originates from applying the Newtonian relation between the tangential velocity and the enclosed mass directly within a relativistic framework, followed by the ad hoc assumption $g(r)=f(r)$ for the metric functions. This procedure leads to an anisotropic fluid with $P_r=-\u03c1$ and $P_t=-r\u03c1'/2-\u03c1$, whose density differs from the claimed halo profile and often becomes non-physical near the horizon, violating the weak energy condition. As a result, the obtained spacetimes do not describe black holes embedded in known galactic halos but rather distinct anisotropic configurations unrelated to the intended matter distribution. We demonstrate this problem on several representative examples from the literature, including metrics based on the NFW, Burkert, Einasto, solitonic, pseudo-isothermal, and Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) profiles, as well as the case of the NGC~4649 halo. For each case, the correct Einstein-consistent form of the metric and the associated physical interpretation are provided. Our analysis clarifies the limits of validity of the Newtonian approximation near compact objects and establishes a consistent framework for constructing dark-matter-inspired black-hole geometries within General Relativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges.

For uncharged black holes, these observables access the geometry all the way to the vicinity of the singularity, while for charged black holes, they only probe up to the inner horizon. Under appropriate conditions, the near-singularity geometry takes the universal form of a Kasner spacetime, characterized by the Kasner exponents. By introducing scalar hair, it is possible to continuously vary the Kasner exponents away from their vacuum values. In this work, we study the behavior of two different observables to determine whether they remain viable holographic duals of complexity in the presence of scalar hair. We also investigate how deeply these observables can probe the Kasner regime near the singularity. To this end, we consider two scalar potentials: an exponential potential, which admits analytic solutions, and a pure mass term, which requires numerical analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u590d Suzhang \u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u590d \u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e2d\u6027\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u51e0\u4f55\u81f3\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ea\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u5185horizon\u9644\u8fd1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u91cf\u53d1 \u867d\u7136\u53ef\u8c03\u8282 Kasner \u6307\u6570\u8fdc\u79bb\u771f\u7a7a\u503c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2 \u6d4b\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d \u6742\u6027\u65cf\u65cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u91cf\u53d1 \u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u65cf\u65cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u540c \u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u65cf\u65cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\uff0c\u6307\u6570\u578b\u548c\u7eaf\u8d28\u91cf\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5bf9 \u5076\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728 Kasner \u884c\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u6570\u578b\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\u80fd\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570 \u503c\u5206\u6790\u7eaf\u8d28\u91cf\u578b\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u505a\u4e3a\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728 Kasner \u884c\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2 \u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u90fd\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u65cf\u65cf\u7684\u5bf9 \u4e07\u4ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a2\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6]%\u5bf9\u5947\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684 Kasner \u884c\u57df\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6307\u6570\u578b\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\u548c\u7eaf\u8d28\u91cf\u578b\u6807\u91cf\u52bf\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f9d\u7136\u4fdd\u7559\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u65cf\u65cf\u7684\u5bf9 doing \u90fd\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d \u6742\u6027\u8868\u9762\u65cf\u65cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a2\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5947\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684 Kasner \u884c\u57df\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching.

Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D.

We electrically activate single \\sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role.

Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $\u039b$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''.

Aim: This perspective evaluates the role of SNSPDs by comparing their performance with other photon-counting detectors for emerging biomedical imaging applications. Approach: We outline the need for ultrasensitive detectors for biophotonics, summarize SNSPD operating principles and compare their performance with established photon-counting devices. We highlight applications in which SNSPDs enable new imaging capabilities and discuss system-level challenges and technological developments that are critical to future applications, including clinical translation. Results: SNSPDs offer advantages in signal-to-noise ratio, temporal precision, and detection bandwidth, enabling deeper tissue imaging, high-precision fluorescence lifetime measurements, and quantum-enhanced imaging modalities. Advances in scalable arrays, cryogenic miniaturization, and improved signal collection are reducing barriers to widespread adoption. Conclusions: SNSPDs are poised to transform photon-limited biomedical imaging. As device performance and system integration continue to advance, their adoption in imaging platforms is expected to accelerate. Combining SNSPDs with advancements in the excitation pathway, such as structured-light excitation with Bessel beams, aberration correction, and wavefront shaping, shows promise for delivering unprecedented imaging capabilities and broadening both the preclinical and clinical utility of these detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u5f3a\u70c8\u62c9\u4f38\u5e94\u53d8\uff0c\u5171\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c42\u72b6 CrSb \u7ed3\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u6781\u5316\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f02\u79cd\u78c1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9ad8_choose \u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u68af\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u8c03\u63a7\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u4e0e\u78c1\u6027\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e8c\u7ef4\u3001\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5f00\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u53d8\u5de5\u7a0b\u8c03\u63a7\u6750\u6599\u78c1\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u5e26\u7279\u6027\u6210\u4e3a-materials \u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u5668\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5355\u6676Fixedmount \u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c proceeds through strain engineering \u52a0\u5165\u9776\u5411\u5e94\u53d8\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728 bulk CrSb \u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u7684\u5267\u70c8\u5c42\u72b6\u5e94\u53d8\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u800c bulk\u5904\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u5fae\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u5e94\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u80fd\u5e26\u51fa\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u6241\u5e73\u5316\uff0c\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u5e94\u53d8\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6742\u5316\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4f34\u968f\u7740ort_apparent strong correlation \u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u7684 Cr3d \u5e73\u5e26\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u5f53\u5e94\u53d8\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u952e\u89e3\u8026\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7edd\u7f18\u54cd\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u7aef\u8c10\u5f20\u5e94\u53d8\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 CrSb \u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u80fd\u5e26\u7279\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u8c03\u5236\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78c1\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u5668\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-B\u00fcttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u675f epitaxy \u751f\u957f\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c-\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e8c\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u54c8\u96f7\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u60e0\u7eb5\u5411\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6001\u548c\u65e0\u80fd\u9699 \u6d0b\u5b50\u7edd\u7f18\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u8fd0\u88ab\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002\u8f93\u8fd0\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u7535\u6781\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u78c1\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u6709\u5173\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027 Landauer-B\u00fcttiker \u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u6781\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u8f93\u8fd0\u548c\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u7535\u6781\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u8f93\u8fd0\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u8fd0\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u62d3\u6251 bulk \u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6b64\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u675f epitaxy \u751f\u957f\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u675f epitaxy \u6280\u672f\u751f\u957f\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u54c8\u96f7\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u975e\u4e92\u60e0\u7eb5\u5411\u8f93\u8fd0\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u6781\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027 Landauer-B\u00fcttiker \u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u8fd0\u5728\u7565\u5fae\u504f\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u6001\u548c\u65e0\u80fd\u9699\u6d0b\u5b50\u7edd\u7f18\u6001\u65f6\u88ab\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002\u8fdc\u5f3a\u4e8e\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8d21\u732e\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u8f93\u8fd0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u4e8c\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u54c8\u96f7\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u60e0\u7eb5\u5411\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5e45\u503c\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7535\u6781\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u78c1\u6027\u5468\u671f\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u904d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u8d21\u732e\u548c\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u8fd0\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e86\u5de8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u4e2d\u7535\u6781\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u6781\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6210\u529f\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5728\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u754c-\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5236\u5907\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u8fd0\u5668\u4ef6\u3002"}}

In order to suppress the inevitable noise effects, a fault-tolerant information processing approach via quantum weak measurement is proposed, where pairwise orthogonal postselected measurement bases with various tiny angles and optimal compositions of measured results are chosen as a decoding rule. The signal to be protected can be retrieved with a minimal distortion after having been transmitted through a noisy channel. Demonstrated by typical examples of encoding signal on two-level superposition state or Einstein-Podolsky-Rossen state transmitted through random telegraph noise and decoherence noises channel, the mean squared error distortion may be close to $0$ and the fault-tolerant capability could reach $1$ with finite quantum resources. To verify the availability of the proposed approach, classic coherent light and quantum coherent state are used for encoding information in the experiment. Potentially, the proposed approach may provide a solution for suppressing noise effects in long-distance quantum communication, high-sensitivity quantum sensing, and accurate quantum computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5f31\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u57fa\u5e95\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u4f20\u9012\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5931\u771f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u96f6\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u5931\u771f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50 sensing\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5230\u6765\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5f31\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5f31\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u5bf9\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6d4b\u91cf\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6781\u5c0f\u89d2\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u57fa\u5e95\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f20\u8f93\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u53f7\u5931\u771f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5178\u578b\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u5982\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e24\u6c34\u5e73\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u6216\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-Podolsky-Rosen\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7535\u62a5\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u96f6\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u5931\u771f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u9047\u5230\u4f55\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u90fd\u80fd\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u5931\u771f\u7387\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u5f31\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u524d\u666f\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728 longer distance communication, high sensitivity sensing, and precise quantum computing \u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u5f00\u6df1\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Rev. D {\\bf 105}. 124022 (2022)], we studied the impact of eccentricity on gravitational-wave parameter estimation for a nonspinning binary neutron star (BNS) system. We here extend the work to a more realistic case by including the spin parameter in the system. As in the previous work, we employ the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri method to calculate the systematic bias that can be produced by using noneccentric waveforms in parameter estimation, and we verify the reliability of the method by comparing it with numerical Bayesian parameter estimation results. We generate $10^4$ BNS sources randomly distributed in the parameter space $m_1$-$m_2$-$\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$-$e_0$, where the nuetron star mass is in the range of $1 M_\\odot \\leq m_{1,2}\\leq 2M_\\odot (m_2 \\leq m_1)$, the effective spin is $-0.2 \\leq \u03c7_{\\rm eff} \\leq0 .2$, and the eccentricity (at the reference frequency 10 Hz) is $0 \\leq e_0 \\leq 0.024$. For the true value of the tidal deformability ($\u03bb$) of neutron stars, we assume the equation of state model APR4. For all gravitational-wave signals emitted from the sources, we calculate the systematic biases ($\u0394\u03b8$) for the chirp mass ($M_c$), symmetric mass ratio ($\u03b7$), effective spin ($\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$), and effective tidal deformability ($\\tilde\u03bb$), and obtain generalized distributions of the biases. The distribution of biases in $M_c, \u03b7$, and $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$ shows narrow bands that increase or decrease quadratically with increasing $e_0$, indicating a weak dependence of biases on the three parameters. On the other hand, the biases of $\\tilde\u03bb$ are widely distributed depending on the values of the mass and spin parameters at a given $e_0$.

Unlike ideal point sources or completely incoherent thermal radiation sources, real-world light sources -- such as high-power laser diode arrays, superluminescent diodes (SLD), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography sources, and beams transmitted through atmospheric turbulence -- typically exhibit partial spatial coherence.\n  Traditional geometric optics based on ray tracing ignores diffraction and interference effects; while classical wave optics is accurate, the computational cost of handling four-dimensional correlation functions for partially coherent fields is enormous. To balance computational efficiency and physical accuracy, phase space optics provides a unified theoretical framework. By introducing the Wigner distribution function (WDF), we can map the light field into a joint space-time-spatial frequency domain $(\\bm{r}, \\bm{p})$. This description not only retains all the information of wave optics (including interference terms) but also naturally transitions to the ray description of Hamiltonian optics in the short-wavelength limit, governed by Liouville's theorem of phase space volume conservation.\n  This report aims to establish optimal modeling methods based on phase space and Hamiltonian optics for different types of extended sources such as partially coherent light, fully coherent light, and quasi-homogeneous light. The report will derive in detail the mathematical models for each source type and provide strict criteria for the applicability of geometric optics models using mathematical tools such as the Moyal expansion and generalized Fresnel number.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u5149\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u51c6\u5747\u5300\u5149\u6e90\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Wigner\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\uff08WDF\uff09\u5c06\u5149\u573a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u65f6\u7a7a-\u9891\u7387\u57df$(\bm{r}, \bm{p})$\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u955c\u5149\u5b66\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u5b66\u4e0e\u6ce2\u52a8\u5149\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u5149\u6e90\u5728\u5149\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u7269\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97 lithography \u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u79cd\u5149\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce2\u52a8\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5149\u6e90\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5149\u5b66\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u6b65\u9aa4\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u9009\u53d6\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5149\u6e90\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5e72\u3001\u51c6\u5747\u5300\u5149\u6e90\uff09\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7Wigner\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u5149\u573a\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\uff1b3. \u5229\u7528Moyal\u5c55\u5f00\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u5bfc\u5404\u7c7b\u578b\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u4e49\u83f2\u6d85\u5c14\u6570\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u76f8\u5e72\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u51c6\u5747\u5300\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u7528\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u5149\u6e90\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5149\u6e90\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7eb3\u7c73\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u7535\u8377\u8f7d\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5916\u52a0\u7535\u538b\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u9762\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63cf\u8ff0\u7535\u8377\u7684 screening\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7eb3\u7c73\u6750\u6599\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u79d1\u6280\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u8377\u8f93\u8fd0\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u9762\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u548cLuttinger\u6db2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u91d1\u5c5e\u78b3\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u4e2d\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684 screening \u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u8bba\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u91d1\u5c5e\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5c4f\u853d\u7279\u6027\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u9762\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ba1\u5185\u79bb\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

However, process incompatibilities have constrained the direct integration of TFLN with only passive silicon photonics. Here, we demonstrate the first heterogeneous back-end-of-line integration of TFLN with a full-functional and active silicon photonics platform via trench-based die-to-wafer bonding. This technology introduces TFLN after completing the full CMOS compatible processes for silicon photonics. Si/SiN passive components including low-loss fiber interfaces, 56-GHz Ge photodetectors, 100-GHz TFLN modulators, and multilayer metallization are integrated on a single silicon chip with efficient inter-layer and inter-material optical coupling. The integrated on-chip optical links exhibit greater than 60 GHz electrical-to-electrical bandwidth and support 128-GBaud OOK and 100-GBaud PAM4 transmission below forward error-correction thresholds, establishing a scalable platform for energy-efficient, high-capacity photonic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Orbital polarization strongly localizes, contrary to expectations.", "motivation": "Understanding the propagation and behavior of orbital polarization is fundamental in orbitronic research as it impacts applications like orbital torque generation and electronic devices.", "method": "Experiments were conducted using Al and Co/Al interfaces to observe orbital polarization effects.", "result": "Orbital polarization shows strong localization, localized to interfaces and bulk Al without participating in non-local effects.", "conclusion": "This finding emphasizes the importance of interface effects in orbital polarization and paves the way for future research into orbital-spin conversion mechanisms."}}

In this work, we propose a scheme to achieve and actively control strong photon blockade in a spinning microwave magnomechanical system by leveraging the combined nonlinear effects of Kerr-induced magnon interactions and an optical parametric amplifier. By exploiting the Sagnac-Fizeau shift, we establish nonreciprocal photon blockade and verify this effect through a combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations. To gain intuitive insight into the underlying nonreciprocity, we approximate the equal-time second-order correlation function using the analytical solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This analytical result is then compared with the full numerical solution derived from the Lindblad master equation. The influences of thermal noise, the probe field amplitude, and the magnetic-dipole coupling strength are investigated within the constraints of the weak-coupling regime. The system's nonclassicality is characterized using the Mandel parameter, complemented by an analysis of the time evolution of the second-order correlation function.

It is well known that in Newtonian gravitation Binet's equation leads to all the conic curves as solutions for an inverse-square force. In this work, we show how Binet's equation arises from the horizontal and vertical infinitesimal displacements of a body in free fall and in inertial motion. This derivation uses elementary concepts of infinitesimal calculus. Second, we derive the relativistic version of Binet's equation for the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter metric. This derivation, which is novel, directly relates the coordinates involved in Binet's equation without the need to introduce potentials or the use of Killing vectors. Finally, we tackle some controversies related to the role of the cosmological constant in the trajectory of photons in a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter or even in Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u4ece\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u843d\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u4f4d\u79fb\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\u7528\u4e8e\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u585e\u7279-(\u53cd)de Sitter\u5ea6\u89c4\u3002 paper\u8fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e cosmological\u5e38\u6570 \u5728\u5149\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u5f62\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u4ece\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u843d\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u63a8\u5bfc Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3 Binet \u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u843d\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6a2a\u5411\u548c\u7eb5\u5411\u4f4d\u79fb\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u7a77esimal\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86 Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u585e\u7279-(\u53cd)de Sitter\u5ea6\u89c4\u7684\u5750\u6807\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684 Binet \u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u6216 Killing \u5411\u91cf\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9Schwarzschild-(\u53cd)de Sitter\u6216Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m-(\u53cd)de Sitter\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5149\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u76f4\u89c2\u548c\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5173\u4e8e cosmological \u5e38\u6570\u5728\u5149\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u7b54\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u7684\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u585e\u7279-(\u53cd)de Sitter\u5ea6\u89c4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5149\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e cosmological \u5e38\u6570 \u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u6df1\u5bf9Binet\u65b9\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5929\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We reconstruct the time profile of the emission, and show that the process is entirely governed by the collective response of the tip plasmon and its field emission. Weak-field optical excitation leads to multiphoton absorption and field emission from the tip apex due to the enhanced local field. The attendant sharp field gradient ensures ponderomotive acceleration of emitted electrons and non-local light-matter interaction. The crossover regime in which simultaneous multiphoton absorption and optical field emission take place is evidenced by the time profile of electron emission correlation, laser power dependence, and polarization angle dependence of each harmonic current.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent developments in spectrum-based entanglement witnesses have enabled new strategies for quantifying many-body entanglement in macroscopic materials. Here, we develop a protocol for detecting spin--orbital entanglement using experiment-accessible resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Central to our approach is the construction of a Hermitian generator from experimentally measurable spectra, which allows us to compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI) available in spin--orbital systems. The resulting QFI provides upper bounds for $k$-producible states and thus serves as a robust witness of spin--orbital entanglement. To account for realistic experimental limitations, we further extend our framework to include relaxed QFI bounds applicable to measurements lacking full polarization resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u5384\u7c73\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u7cfb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f(QFI)\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b8c\u5168\u6781\u5316\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5ea6\u91cf interrogation framework", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Starting from a trial spectrum, we invert the crossing equations to extract the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients. The statistical distribution of these coefficients, obtained by sampling over cross-ratios, provides a quantitative measure of how closely crossing symmetry is satisfied. We then define a reward function based on this statistic and employ a genetic algorithm to search for spectra that maximize the reward. A key advantage of our framework is that it does not rely on unitarity. We illustrate the method using Virasoro blocks with central charge $c<1$, where the optimal solutions align with the known minimal models.

Here we provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite does in fact host photoluminescent color centres. In meteoritic lonsdaleite grains from the ureilite NWA7983, we identify a new defect, RU1, which exhibits bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm, with optimal blue excitation (~455 nm) and a peak at ~700 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns with no detectable blinking, bleaching, or charge conversion. From the excitation-emission energetics we infer an unresolved zero-phonon line near 550 nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirms the lonsdaleite host lattice, and compositional analysis suggests N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents. These results suggest lonsdaleite could become a new quantum-grade crystalline platform and indicate that hexagonal-diamond color centres may form a new and unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters.", "AI": {"tldr": "lonsdaleite hosts photoluminescent color centers that exhibit stable emission across 550-800 nm, excited optimally by ~455 nm, with no blinking or bleaching.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this paper is to investigate the optical properties of lonsdaleite, specifically whether it hosts photoluminescent color centers.

Existing scheduling approaches use dedicated bus qubits for routing and separate peripheral ancilla qubit factories for magic state preparation, leading to inefficient resource utilization. With the advent of magic state cultivation, preparation qubits can be placed anywhere within the surface code architecture. We introduce Pure Magic scheduling, which dynamically re-purposes magic state cultivation qubits for routing operations, eliminating dedicated bus infrastructure. By interrupting cultivation when qubits are needed for routing, Pure Magic naturally favors shorter cultivation times while ensuring no ancilla qubit remains idle. Our evaluation across 17 benchmark circuits improves scheduling efficiency by 19% to 223% compared to traditional bus routing and decreases average magic state preparation time by 2.6x to 9.7x. Benefits scale with circuit parallelism, making Pure Magic particularly valuable for highly parallel quantum algorithms. The Pure Magic architecture represents a paradigm shift from static to dynamic, demand-driven scheduling in fault-tolerant quantum architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These algorithms typically begin by transforming the original nonlinear ODE into a higher-dimensional linear ODE using a linearization technique, most commonly Carleman linearization. Existing works restrict their analysis to ODEs where the nonlinearities are polynomial functions of the dependent variables, significantly limiting their applicability. In this work we construct an efficient quantum algorithm for solving ODEs with `Fourier' nonlinear terms expressible as $d{\\bf u}/dt = G_0 + G_1 e^{i{\\bf u}}$, where ${\\bf u}$ denotes a vector of $n$ complex variables evolving with $t$, $G_0$ is an $n$-dimensional complex vector, $G_1$ is an $n \\times n$ complex matrix and $e^{i{\\bf u}}$ denotes the vector with entries $\\{e^{iu_j}\\}$. To tackle the Fourier nonlinear term, which is not expressible as a finite sum of polynomials of ${\\bf u}$, our algorithm employs a generalization of the Carleman linearization technique known as Koopman linearization. We also make other methodological advances towards relaxing the stringent dissipativity condition required for efficient solution extraction and towards integrated readout of classical quantities from the solution state. Our results open avenues to the development of efficient quantum algorithms for a significantly wider class of high-dimensional nonlinear ODEs, thereby broadening the scope of their applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Quantifying the angular trap stiffness is essential for interpreting the rotational dynamics of probe particles. While methods for trap stiffness calibration are well established for translational degrees of freedom, angular trapping has been largely overlooked and is often assumed to behave analogously to translational dynamics. However, rotational and translational motions are sensitive to distinct experimental parameters and offer separate insights. This work covers passive analysis techniques for calibrating the angular trap stiffness and examines the influence of several factors unique to rotational optical tweezers. We show that the parameters of an ancillary measurement beam can be tuned to minimise its influence on angular trapping dynamics, while offering unprecedented improvements for nanoparticle analysis.

In this paper, we present high quality solutions in noise-free Qiskit simulations of networks with up to twelve locations using a hybrid penalty-free, circuit-model, Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA). Noisy qubits are also simulated. To our knowledge, this is the first successful VQA simulation of a twelve-location TSP on circuit-model devices. Multiple encoding strategies, including factorial, non-factorial, and Gray encoding are evaluated. Our formulation scales as $\\mathcal{O}(nlog_2(n))$ qubits, requiring only 29 qubits for twelve locations, compared with over 100 qubits for conventional approaches scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Computational time is further reduced by almost two orders of magnitude through the use of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) gradient estimation and cost-function caching. We also introduce a novel machine-learning model, and benchmark both quantum and classical approaches against a Monte Carlo baseline. The VQA outperforms the classical machine-learning approach, and performs similarly to Monte Carlo for the small networks simulated.

The model incorporates quartic or sextic self-interactions in the scalar Lagrangian, which support the existence of stationary, solitonic, gravitationally bound solutions. We numerically construct these multi-component systems and investigate how the self-interactions alter their global properties -- specifically the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass $M$, the angular momentum $J$ and the morphology of their ergospheres. A central result is the distinct dependence of the $(\u03c9, M)$ and $(\u03c9, J)$ relations on the parity of the chains. Specifically, systems with an even number of constituents display spiraling curves, while those with an odd number exhibit loop structures. Moreover, we observe that two initially distinct ergospheres merge into a single one as the frequency $\u03c9$ increases. Our analysis also indicates that the quartic interaction imposes more restrictive existence bounds, particularly for odd-numbered chains, thereby restricting stable configurations to the weak-coupling regime. In contrast, the sextic interaction has a weaker effect and enables stable solutions at substantially stronger couplings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u590d\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u73bb\u8272\u661f\u94fe\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65cb \u8f6c\u73bb\u8272\u661f\u94fe\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u5916\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6784\u9020\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u963f\u8bfa\u5fb7-\u5fb7\u585e- \u60e0\u65af\u987f\u65f6\u91cf\u3001\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u53d1 \u73b0\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u5947\u6570\u4e2a\u548c\u5076\u6570\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf \u968f\u7740\u9891\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u539f\u6765\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u7ed3\u6784\u9010\u6e10\u5411\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u56db\u6781\u6570\u76ee\u4e3a\u5076\u6570\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u87ba\u65cb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5947\u6570\u6570\u76ee\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u73af\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5076\u6570 \u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u5728\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u624d\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5947\u6570\u6570\u76ee\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u6b21\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u6240\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u660e\u663e\u4f4e\u4e8e\u516d\u6b21\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Such modes arise due to oscillations of the waveguides in the array, periodically switching the structure between topological and trivial phases on each modulation period, so that on average it seems trivial. Localization of such modes depends on the amplitude of waveguide oscillations. Depending on the discrete rotational symmetry of the arrays with disclinations, these modes exhibit distinct spatial profiles unattainable in periodic lattices. Propagation in a medium with focusing cubic nonlinearity reveals that these Floquet states remain localized below a critical power threshold, indicating the possibility of the formation of disclination-bound Floquet solitons.

We demonstrate that such parity-odd harmonics are related to their parity-even counterparts through the action of a `Chern-Simons operator', which we present as a novelty in this paper. This relation leads to the construction of simultaneous eigen-functions of the Laplacian and the Chern-Simons operators. Subsequently, these harmonic functions are employed to construct propagators in pure abelian Chern-Simons theory as well as Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory in a covariant gauge. We demonstrate the consistency of the Chern-Simons propagator with the expected two-point function of the boundary currents. Our results are built upon the embedding formalism, which we modify suitably to incorporate parity-odd structures. This formalism also readily helps us write down parity odd structures for the propagators of higher-spin fields. Finally, we construct a split representation for the parity-odd harmonic functions, which may be useful to compute Witten diagrams with loops.

Accepted for publication in IEEE Trans. on Appl. Supercond", "summary": "As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b cryogenic \u7535\u5b50\u5b66 \u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u5355\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\uff08SFQ\uff09\u7535\u8def\u56e0\u5176\u8fdc\u975e\u540c \u4e00\u7684\u3001 bulk \u548c\u8017\u7535\u9ad8\u7684\u5ba4\u6e29\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b \u4e86\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u5b57 qubit \u63a7\u5236\u3001\u8bfb\u51fa\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u5904\u7406\uff0cSFQ \u7535\u8def\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u7684 100\u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u96f6\u5ea6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002SEEQC \u7684 SFQuClass \u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u5b50\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u80fd\u6548\u7684 SFQ\uff08ERSFQ\uff09\u7535 \u611f\u6a21\u5757\u548c qubits \u8fd1\u90bb\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u591a\u82af\u7247\u6a21\u5757\u91cc\u3002ancers \u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5178\u578b\u7a00\u91ca\u5f0f cryostat \u6709\u9650\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6781\u9ad8\u7684 \u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4ece 4 \u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u5230 10 \u7c73\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730 \u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u6279 ERSFQ \u7ec6\u80de\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57 qubit \u63a7\u5236\u7684\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u8def\u5982\u53ef \u7f16\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7ebf\u5668\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f59\u91cf\u53ca\u9519\u8bef\u7387 \u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728 100 \u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u504f\u7f6e\u4f59\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u540c\u65f6\u504f\u7f6e\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u6700\u4f73 \u503c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u4e0a\u5347\u7ea6 15%\uff0c\u4e0e 4.2 \u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u6bd4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c0f JJ \u4e34\u754c\u7535\u6d41 Ic \u70ed\u5904\u7406\u9000\u706b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u4f59\u91cf\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ece 4.2 \u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u5411 100 \u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u76f8\u5173\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\uff08PCMs\uff09\u5728 100 \u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u6e29\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u6d4b\u5f97\u7684 JJ \u4e34\u754c\u7535\u6d41\uff08PCM JJ \u6570\u7ec4\uff09\u5728\u51cf\u5c0f\u6e29\u5ea6\u4ece 4.2 \u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u5230 100 \u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u7ea6 15%\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u5b57\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u504f\u7f6e\u4f59\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u543b\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u66f4\u6613\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002 smallest \u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u548c cryogenic \u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u4ece 4 K \u5230 10 mK \u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u5168\u9762 ERSFQ \u7ec6\u80de\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7535\u8def\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u548c\u5206\u7ebf\u5668\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u5173\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u76d1\u89c6\u5668 (PCMs) \u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728 100 \u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u504f\u7f6e\u4f59\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6 15%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e2d\u5fc3\u70b9\u504f\u7f6e\u503c\u589e\u52a0\u7ea6 15%\u3002JJ \u4e34\u754c\u7535\u6d41 Ic \u968f\u6e29\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u589e\u52a0\u7ea6 15%\uff0c\u5728 4.2 K \u5230 100 mK \u6e29\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684 cryogenic \u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5904\u7406\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728 100 \u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u5904\u7406\u9000\u706b\u51cf\u5c11 JJ \u4e34\u754c\u7535\u6d41 Ic \u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u5b57 qubit \u63a7\u5236\u6240\u9700\u7684 ERSFQ \u7535\u8def\u5728\u7a00\u91ca\u5f0f cryostat \u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Prepared for the proceedings of the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24), Glasgow, 14-18 July 2025", "summary": "Integrability structures are known to play a key role in one-dimensional scattering. In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi & Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the \"KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative\" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a \"semi-direct action\" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the \"wave-mean flow\" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Schwarzschild\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528Darboux\u5171\u53d8\u6027\u548cKdV\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f31Lax\u5bf9\u53ca\u5176\u65e0\u9650\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7b49\u8c31\u6d41\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u81ea\u4f34\u65f6\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u534a\u76f4\u79ef\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u6ce2-\u5e73\u5747\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728Schwarzschild\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7ed3\u6784 framework \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Darboux\u5171\u53d8\u6027\u548cKdV\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u53ef\u79ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5f31Lax\u5bf9\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7b49\u8c31\u6d41\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u81ea\u4f34\u65f6\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f31Lax\u5bf9\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u573a\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7b49\u8c31\u6d41\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728 bulk \u5230 boundary \u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534a\u76f4\u79ef\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86Schwarzschild\u5f15\u529b\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u534a\u76f4\u79ef\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In the bulk, we focus on AdS bubbles, geometries that fit within a consistent truncation to a gauged five-dimensional supergravity. We show that the BPS equations can be decoupled, and we study the geometries perturbatively and numerically. Applying the holographic dictionary, we compute the expectation values of light chiral primaries in these backgrounds. This data allows us to determine the dual CFT state up to quadratic order in the fluctuations.

We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing.

Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms.

By introducing the auxiliary bad cavity and exploiting the nonreciprocal condition, this model can harness the environmental dissipation to suppress the reverse energy transfer. Under resonant conditions, we have achieved a four ratio of the battery energy to the charger energy; in contrast, this ratio is significantly reduced under large detuning.

Quantum cryptographic conferencing serves as an essential solution to establish secure keys to realize secure multi-user communications. However, existing QCC implementations have been fundamentally limited by the low probability of multi-user coincidence detection to measure or construct the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state. In this work, we report the experimental realization of QCC eliminating the need for coincidence detection, where the GHZ state is constructed by correlating detection events occurring within the coherence time, thereby greatly enhancing the success probability of GHZ-state measurement. Meanwhile, to establish and maintain high-visibility GHZ measurement among three independent users, we developed a three-party phase compensation scheme combined with precise temporal and polarization alignment within a time-bin-phase encoding framework. Furthermore, we designed an efficient pairing strategy to simplify subsequent data processing and enhance processing efficiency. Based on these techniques, we successfully performed QCC experiments over total channel losses of 66.3 dB, corresponding to 331.5 km of commercial fiber (0.2 dB/km), achieving secure key rates of 5.4 bit/s, whereas previous QCC experiments have been limited to 100 km.

Using the Simpson-Visser \"black-bounce\" geometry as an elegant, analytically tractable framework, we explore the intricate thermodynamic behavior in such models. We demonstrate that this regular spacetime exhibits a critical instability, marked by a phase transition where the heat capacity is discontinuous. This transition signals a fundamental change in the black hole's evaporation state, which depends on the regularization parameter. Pushing beyond the semiclassical limit, we then derive the leading-order quantum corrections to the entropy via the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism. Our analysis provides a refined statistical basis for the entropy of non-singular spacetimes and offers a quantitative analysis of the nature of the black hole end-state. These results reveal that singularity resolution is not merely a geometric modification but a profound thermodynamic event, with direct implications for the stability and ultimate fate of evaporating black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "singularity resolution fundamentally alters black hole thermodynamics, leading to a phase transition in evaporation", "motivation": "exploring the effects of singularity resolution on black hole thermodynamics", "method": "using simpson-visser geometry, hamilton-jacobi tunneling formalism, and analytical/numerical methods", "result": "regular black holes exhibit critical instability, phase transition with discontinuous heat capacity, and quantum corrections to entropy based on regularization parameter strength, affecting the black hole end-state and stability", "conclusion": "singularity resolution significantly impacts black hole evaporation and thermodynamics, moving beyond geometric modifications to a profound physical event influencing black hole stability and ultimate fate"}}

To date, this scalability has been limited by the stochastic nature of the quantum light sources. Moreover, hybrid integration of different platforms will likely be necessary to combine state-of-the-art devices into a functioning architecture. Here, we demonstrate the active alignment and edge-coupling of arrays of ten site-controlled gallium arsenide quantum dots to an array of ten silicon nitride single-mode waveguides, at cryogenic temperatures. The coupling is facilitated by the fabrication of nanopillars, deterministically self-aligned around each quantum dot, leading to a high-yield and regular array of single-photon sources. An on-chip beamsplitter verifies the triggered emission of single photons into the silicon nitride chip. The low inhomogeneous broadening of the ensemble enables us to observe the spectral overlap of adjacent site-controlled emitters. Across the array of waveguides, the signal collected from each coupled quantum dot is consistently and reproducibly 0.17 relative to the free-space collection from the very same single-photon source. Comparing measurement with waveguide simulations, we infer that absolute coupling efficiencies of $\\approx 5 \\%$ are currently obtained between our quantum dots and the waveguides.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For the GO model, we showed that a spatially flat universe inevitably evolves toward a big rip singularity. At the same time, the inclusion of spatial curvature modifies the expansion rate without removing the finite-time divergence: positive curvature speeds up the formation of the singularity, whereas negative curvature induces transitions between quintessence, de Sitter, and phantom-like regimes. When Kaniadakis entropy corrections are incorporated, the qualitative behavior changes substantially. The modified HDE density admits a stable de Sitter critical point and evolves toward a little rip singularity, in which the Hubble rate diverges only at infinite cosmic time. We further demonstrate that spatial curvature acts solely as a quantitative deformation in this scenario. Although it alters the detailed expansion history, it does not alter the little-rip character of the future singularity. Our results reveal that the asymptotic fate of holographic cosmologies is highly sensitive to the underlying entropy-area relation: the GO model robustly predicts a big rip.

Here we present a proof-of-concept fabrication via soft lithography and Hg infusion of microfluidic X-ray absorption gratings and their performance in biomedical imaging.

With the inherent non-orthogonality of coherent states, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) naturally lends itself to the implementation of multi-user OQC. However, this remains unexplored in the literature. This paper proposes a novel successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based Kennedy receiver for uplink NOMA-OQC systems, along with a new approach for power allocation of the coherent states emitted by users. The key idea is to rigorously derive the asymptotic sum-rate of the considered systems, taking into account the impact of atmospheric turbulence, background noise, and lossy photon channel. With the asymptotic sum-rate, we optimize the average number of photons (or powers) of the coherent states emitted by the users. Variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) are employed to convexify and maximize the asymptotic sum-rate iteratively. A new coherent-state power allocation algorithm is developed for a small-to-medium number of users. We further develop its low-complexity variant using adaptive importance sampling, which is suitable for scenarios with a medium-to-large number of users.

In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{\u03bc\u03bd})$ containing a caustic $\\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, signals in pump-probe microscopy are typically small and often must be measured in the presence of large backgrounds. As a result, achieving measurements with a high signal-to-noise ratio is challenging, particularly when using sensors that are easily saturated, such as CMOS cameras. We present a method for enhancing signal-to-noise ratio while avoiding detector saturation. In this approach, temporally separated (sheared) reference and probe pulses transmit through a sample before and after the arrival of a pump pulse. The probe and reference pulses are then temporally recombined with opposing phases and nearly matched amplitudes, resulting in interferometric background subtraction. This recombining operation is performed by a novel common-path interferometer. Unlike previous techniques for temporal shearing, this interferometer demonstrates negligible phase and group delay dispersion with angle of incidence, allowing convenient widefield imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first common-path interferometer with such a property. We demonstrate the technique by measuring transient absorption signals in gold nanorod films with a signal-to-background ratio enhanced by over 100% and a signal-to-noise ratio enhanced by about 70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u957f\u5206\u675f\u663e\u5fae\u955c Method\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 signal-to-noise ratio \u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528 Temporally Sheared Pulsed Techniques and \u5171\u632f\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\uff08Common-path Interferometer\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u907f\u514d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u9971\u548c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 gold nanorod films \u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0 signal-to-background \u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc7 100% \u548c signal-to-noise ratio \u7684\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 70%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740 pump-probe \u6280\u672f\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5b58\u5728 large backgrounds \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6d4b\u91cf signal \u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684 Temporally Sheared Pulsed \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5171\u632f\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86 Temporally Sheared Pulsed Techniques\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 pump \u548c probe \u8109\u51b2\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5229\u7528 Temporally Sheared \u53c2\u8003\u548c\u63a2\u9488\u8109\u51b2\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u54c1\u524d\u548c\u540e\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u63a2\u9488\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u8109\u51b2\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e72\u6d89\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6d88\u9664\u3002\u5173\u952e\u969c\u788d\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u7ec4\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5171\u632f\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 gold nanorod films \u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a signal-to-background \u6bd4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc7 100%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14 signal-to-noise \u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea6 70%\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6d4b\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7 Temporally Sheared Pulsed Techniques \u548c\u5171\u632f\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 pump-probe \u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7684 signal-to-noise \u6bd4\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u9971\u548c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728 widefield imaging \u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5171\u632f\u8def\u5f84\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u4f4e\u65f6\u5dee\u6269\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This paper maximizes the sum secret key rate (SKR) of a novel uplink non-orthogonal multiple access based continuous-variable QKD (NOMA-CVQKD) system under collective attacks. The proposed system uses Gaussian-modulated coherent states and a quantum successive interference cancellation based heterodyne receiver. We derive closed-form asymptotic bounds for the legitimate users' achievable key rates via the entropy power inequality and maximum entropy principle, as well as for the eavesdropper's intercepted information based on Holevo information. A successive convex approximation based power allocation algorithm is developed to maximize the asymptotic sum SKR of the NOMA-CVQKD system under collective attacks, with guaranteed convergence to a locally optimal Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. Simulation results show that the proposed NOMA-CVQKD system with the power allocation algorithm achieves up to 23% higher sum SKR than quantum-orthogonal multiple access, supports 16 users at excess noise variance 0.1, and remains robust under varying turbulence intensities and transmission distances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6076\u610f\u91cf\u5b50\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08NOMA-CVQKD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8c03\u5236\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7d2f\u52a0\u5e72\u6270\u53d6\u6d88\u5171\u8f6d\u8c03\u5236\u63a5\u6536\u5668\uff0c Drive\u5206\u6790\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6e10\u8fd1\u754c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caeve\u622a\u83b7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9012\u589e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 NOMA-CVQKD \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18 Karush-Kuhn-Tucker \u89e3\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684 Proposed NOMA-CVQKD \u7cfb\u7edf\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u6700\u591a\u9ad8\u51fa 23%\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6301 16 \u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5dee 0.1 \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5149 Perturbation \u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u5747\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08NOMA-CVQKD\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8c03\u5236\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u6355\u9c7c\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7d2f\u52a0\u5e72\u6270\u53d6\u6d88\u5171\u8f6d\u8c03\u5236\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a5\u6536\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u529f\u7387\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u539f\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6e10\u8fd1\u754c\uff0c \u5e76\u5229\u7528 Holevo \u4fe1\u606f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86[::-\u672a\u77e5] Eve \u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9012\u589e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316 NOMA-CVQKD \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u603b\u79d8\u5bc6\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\uff0c \u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18 Karush-Kuhn-Tucker \u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684 NOMA-CVQKD \u7cfb\u7edf\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad8 23%\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5dee 0.1 \u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u652f\u6301 16 \u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149 Perturbation \u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e NOMA-CVQKD \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the spatio-temporal equilibrium properties of incoherent multimode optical waves through the analysis of the (2+1)D Bose-Einstein thermal distribution and the corresponding classical Rayleigh-Jeans approximation. In the anomalous dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by positive temperatures. In this regime, we show that as the number of modes of the waveguide increases, the fundamental spatial mode becomes macroscopically populated, while its temporal spectrum undergoes significant narrowing, ultimately leading to complete (2+1)D spatio-temporal condensation in the thermodynamic limit. In the normal dispersion regime, the spatio-temporal equilibrium is characterized by negative temperature states that exhibit a hybrid character: the spatial equilibrium displays an inverted modal population, whereas the temporal spectrum remains peaked around the fundamental (carrier) optical frequency. In this regime, we predict that spatio-temporal light waves exhibit a phase transition to Bose-Einstein condensation at negative temperatures, which occurs by increasing the temperature above a negative critical value.

Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes.

However, their intrinsically weak ground-state interactions pose a major limitation to the advancement of scalable quantum simulation and computation. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to enhancing the ground-state interaction strength of neutral atoms via Floquet modulation of a Rydberg atomic ensemble. Each Floquet period consists of ground-state coupling followed by a pulse driving the transition from the ground state to the Rydberg state. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that after a defined evolution time, neutral atoms within Rydberg ensembles can collectively form a $W$ state in the ground-state manifold. Even when the Rydberg interaction strength is far below the blockade regime, the fidelity remains remarkably high. Finally, we analyze the application of this scheme in the preparation of single-photon sources. In general, our proposed mechanism offers an efficient and highly controllable method for quantum state preparation within the Rydberg atomic ensembles, significantly enhancing the accuracy and stability of quantum state engineering while providing a well-controlled quantum environment for single-photon generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection.

QCSC leverages quantum computers to perform the classically intractable task of sampling the dominant fermionic configurations from the Hilbert space that have substantial support to a target state, followed by Hamiltonian diagonalization on a classical processor. However, noisy quantum hardware produces erroneous samples upon measurements, making robust and efficient configuration-recovery strategies essential for a scalable QCSC pipeline. Toward this, in this work, we introduce PIGen-SQD, an efficiently designed QCSC workflow that utilizes the capability of generative machine learning (ML) along with physics-informed configuration screening via implicit low-rank tensor decompositions for accurate fermionic state reconstruction. The physics-informed pruning is based on a class of efficient perturbative measures that, in conjunction with hardware samples, provide a substantial overlap with the target state. This distribution induces an anchoring effect on the generative ML models to stochastically explore only the dominant sector of the Hilbert space for effective identification of additional important configurations in a self-consistent manner. Our numerical experiments performed on IBM Heron R2 quantum processors demonstrate this synergistic workflow produces compact, high-fidelity subspaces that substantially reduce diagonalization cost while maintaining chemical accuracy under strong electronic correlations. By embedding classical many body intuitions directly into the generative ML model, PIGen-SQD advances the robustness and scalability of QCSC algorithms, offering a promising pathway toward chemically reliable quantum simulations on utility-scale quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we present a consistent formalism which has the traditional state-observable framework integrated with the desirable features of dBBT. We adopt ensemble interpretation for the Schrodinger wave function $\u03c8$. Given a Schrodinger wave function $\u03c8$, we use its value $\u03c8_0$ at some fixed time (say, $t = 0$) to define the probability measure $|\u03c8_0|^2 {\\rm d}x$ on the system configuration space $M$ ($=\\mathbb{R}^n$). On the resulting probability space $\\mathcal{M}_0$, we introduce a stochastic process $\u03be(t)$ corresponding to the Heisenberg position operator $X_H(t)$ such that, in the Heisenberg state $|\u03c8_h\\rangle$ corresponding to $\u03c8_0$, the expectation value of $X_H(t)$ equals that of $\u03be(t)$ in $\\mathcal{M}_0$. This condition leads to the de Broglie-Bohm guidance equation for the sample paths of the process $\u03be(t)$ which are, therefore, Bohmian trajectories supposedly representing time-evolutions of individual members of the $\u03c8_0$-ensemble. Stochastic processes and Bohmian trajectories corresponding to observables with discrete eigenvalues (in particular spin) are treated by extending the configuration space to the spectral space of the commutative algebra obtained by adding appropriate discrete observables to the position observables.

Our results provide a concrete physical mechanism for the quantum-classical transition in a chaotic system and demonstrate that essential aspects of quantum measurement-state projection, Born-rule-like selection, and irreversibility-can naturally emerge from intrinsic gain dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u7279\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5149\u6c14\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8017\u6563\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u6c14\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8017\u6563\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7531\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8017\u6563\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Such systems can be described by non-Hermitian quantum mechanics (NHQM), where the Hamiltonian includes dissipative terms. Within NHQM, one can also formulate the Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham (KS) methods and, as in the conventional theory, an effective independent-particle picture is employed. The crucial observation of the present work is that even for systems that are not coupled to an environment, in the HF or KS equation a single electron is coupled to a bath of the remaining electrons which can act as an environment, opening up the possibility for the exchange of current density between the one-electron and the remaining N-1 electron system. The corresponding self-consistent states represent a new uncharted space of solutions to the HF and KS equations.

All-nitride Josephson Junctions (JJs) have attracted substantial attention for their potential to provide enhanced coherence times and enable higher temperature operation.

This work diagnoses atomic-scale limitations preventing superconducting NbN/AlN/NbN JJs from reaching their full potential. Electrical measurements reveal suppressed critical current density and soft onset of quasiparticle current. However, inverse proportionality between resistance and junction area confirms homogenous barrier thickness. This isolates structural and chemical variations in electrodes and barrier as the source of performance limitation. The observed characteristics are attributed to complex materials problems: NbN polymorphism, phase coexistence, and oxygen impurities. Using advanced microscopy and machine learning integrated approach, nanoscale inclusions of epsilon-Nb2N2 are found to coexist within dominant delta-NbN electrodes. DC performance of JJs may be affected by these defects, leading to unresolved supercurrent and soft transition to normal state.

However, spin qubit devices face a key architectural bottleneck: the large physical footprint of readout components relative to qubits prevents a dense layout where all qubits can be measured simultaneously, complicating the implementation of quantum error correction. This challenge is offset by the platform's unique rapid shuttling capability, which can be used to transport qubits to distant readout ports. In this work, we explore the design constraints and capabilities of spin qubits in silicon and propose the SNAQ (Shuttling-capable Narrow Array of spin Qubits) surface code architecture, which relaxes the 1:1 readout-to-qubit assumption by leveraging spin shuttling to time-multiplex ancilla qubit initialization and readout. Our analysis shows that, given sufficiently high (experimentally demonstrated) qubit coherence times, SNAQ delivers an orders-of-magnitude reduction in chip area per logical qubit. Additionally, by using a denser grid of physical qubits, SNAQ enables fast transversal logic for short-distance logical operations, achieving 4.0-22.3x improvement in local logical clock speed while still supporting global operations via lattice surgery. This translates to a 57-60% reduction in spacetime cost of 15-to-1 magic state distillation, a key fault-tolerant subroutine.

This leads to a classification of non-local strategies, and a tight boundary where standard self-testing do not apply and complex self-testing is necessary.

Despite challenges such as susceptibility to noise-induced local minima, we achieved notable advantages in improving the computational accuracy and stability of CIMs. We conducted a successful experimental demonstration of CIM via femto-second laser pumping that integrates optimization strategies across optical and structural dimensions, resulting in significant performance enhancements. The results are particularly promising. An average success rate of 55% was achieved to identify optimal solutions within a Mobius Ladder graph comprising 100 vertices. Compared with other alternatives, the femto-second pulse results in significantly higher peak power, leading to more pronounced quantum effects and lower pump power in optical fiber based CIMs. In addition, we have maintained an impressive success rate for a continuous period of 8 hours, emphasizing the practical applicability of CIMs in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, our research extends to the application of these principles in practical applications such as molecular docking and credit scoring.

The stabilizer description, however, restricts the accessible noise one can incorporate into the simulation to Pauli-type noise. More general noise, including coherent errors, may have more severe impact on circuit performance than Pauli noise; yet, such general noise have been difficult to access, much less investigate fully, in numerical simulations. Here, through the use of stratified importance sampling, we show how general noise can be simulated within the stabilizer formalism in reasonable time, with non-unitary noise being nearly as cheap as Pauli noise. Unitary (or coherent) noise can require an order of magnitude more time for the simulation, but nevertheless completes in very reasonable times, a drastic improvement over past approaches that typically fail to converge altogether. Our work thus enables detailed beyond-Pauli understanding of circuit performance in the presence of real device noise, which is rarely Pauli in nature. Among other examples, we present direct simulation results for the performance of the popular rotated planar surface codes under circuit-level general noise, previously available only in limited situations and/or through mappings to efficiently simulatable physical models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Building on prior CPU-only approaches, our pipeline combines a single NVIDIA A100 GPU for quantum state construction, followed by N parallel CPU jobs that perform distributed measurement sampling. We validate the fidelity by simulating the 53-qubit, 14-cycle Sycamore circuit and achieving a linear cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) score of 0.549, exceeding the published XEB score of 0.002 from Google's reference data. We then evaluate execution time performance with the more complex 53-qubit, 20-cycle circuit, completing the full 2.5 million-shot workload over 100 CPU jobs in 01:15:36, representing a 6.95 x 10^7 speedup compared to Google's original classical estimate. Further, we show that if 1,000 CPU jobs were employed, the estimated duration would be approximately 00:17:35, only 12 minutes slower than the time taken by the original QPU-based experiment.

The scheme follows a source-device-independent (SDI) security model in which the entropy originates from quantum measurement uncertainty and no model of the source is required; security depends only on the trusted measurement device and the calibrated discretization, and thus remains valid even under adversarial state preparation. The optical field is split by a 90$^\\circ$ optical hybrid and measured by two balanced photodiodes to obtain both quadratures of the vacuum state simultaneously. The analog outputs are digitized using a dual-channel 12-bit analog-to-digital converter operating at a sampling rate of 3.2 GS/s per channel, and processed in real time by an FPGA implementing Toeplitz hashing for randomness extraction. The quantum-to-classical noise ratio was verified through calibrated power spectral density measurements and cross-checked in the time domain, confirming vacuum-noise dominance within the 1.6 GHz detection bandwidth. After extraction, the system achieves a sustained generation rate of $R_{\\rm net}= 33.92~\\mathrm{Gbit/s}$ of uniformly distributed random bits, which pass all NIST and Dieharder statistical tests.

In classical star networks, such mediated coupling gives rise to remote synchronization--where nonadjacent leaf nodes synchronize through a nonsynchronous hub--and to explosive synchronization, characterized by an abrupt collective transition to coherence. In the quantum regime, analogous effects can arise from the interplay between 1:1 phase locking and 2:1 phase-locking blockade in coupled spin-1 oscillators. In this work, we investigate a star network composed of spin-1 oscillators. For identical oscillators, symmetric and asymmetric dissipation lead to distinct transmission behaviors: remote synchronization and quasi-explosive synchronization appear in different coupling regimes, a phenomenon absent in classical counterparts. For nonidentical networks, we find that at large detuning remote synchronization emerges in the weak-coupling regime and evolves into quasi-explosive synchronization as the coupling increases, consistent with classical star-network dynamics.

The first requirement guarantees an exponentially accelerating convergence to the steady state, while the second implies that a quantum system initially farther from equilibrium approaches it more rapidly than an initial state closer to it. This protocol provides a genuine Mpemba effect, and its numerical simulation requires low computational effort. We prove that, for any initial state, there always exists a permutation matrix that maximizes its distance from the equilibrium for a given information-theoretic distinguishability measure.

Quantum expectation values are usually calculated via Hilbert space inner products and, thereby, differently from expectation values in classical mechanics, which are weighted phase-space integrals. It is shown that, by using Anti-Wick quantization to associate dynamical variables with self-adjoint linear operators, quantum expectation values can be interpreted as genuine weighted averages over phase space, paralleling their classical counterparts. This interpretation arises naturally in the Segal-Bargmann space, where creation and annihilation operators act as simple multiplication and differentiation operators. In this setting, the Husimi Q-function - the coherent-state representation of the quantum state - can be seen as a true probability density in phase space. Unlike Bohmian mechanics, the present approach retains the standard correspondence between dynamical variables and self-adjoint operators while paving the way for a classical-like probabilistic interpretation of quantum statistics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u91ca\u91cf\u5b50\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5a01\u514b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u671f\u671b\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u5728\u585e\u5c14-\u5df4\u683c\u66fc\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e6e\u706d\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u7b97\u5b50\u5206\u522b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e58\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c Husimi Q-\u51fd\u6570 - \u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u8868\u793a - \u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u4f5c\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u4e0e\u73bb\u59c6\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211adjoint\u7b97\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53cd\u5a01\u514b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u585e\u5c14-\u5df4\u683c\u66fc\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e6e\u706d\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u7b97\u5b50\u5206\u522b\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e58\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u671f\u671b\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u79ef\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u7c7b\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211adjoint\u7b97\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we theoretically propose and demonstrate a scheme for generating non-Gaussian mechanical states using a strongly driven hybrid system that combines cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and cavity optomechanics. Our protocol prepares a non-Gaussian cavity state in the dispersive regime of cavity QED and subsequently transfers it to a mechanical oscillator using the optomechanical interaction enhanced by a coherent cavity drive. While non-Gaussian cavity state control in cavity QED is well established in the dispersive regime, its behavior under strong cavity drive, essential for cavity optomechanics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we develop an efficient simulation framework to model cavity QED dynamics in the high-photon-number regime. We show that a strong cavity drive can coherently displace the cavity state with minimal perturbations, effectively decoupling it from the qubit. The resulting large coherent cavity field enhances the optomechanical coupling strength, enabling high-fidelity transfer of non-Gaussian cavity states to the mechanical mode. These results reveal new dynamical features of driven cavity QED and open a pathway toward realizing non-Gaussian mechanical quantum memories and sensors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8154\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(QED)\u548c\u8154\u5149\u673a\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u68b0\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684 cavity QED \u548c optomechanics \u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u68b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7126\u70b9\u3002\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u8154QED\u548c\u5149\u673a\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u8154QED\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u79fb\u81f3\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u5b50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u673a\u529b\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u5149\u5b50\u6570-regime \u4e2d\u8154QED\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8154QED\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u79fb\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u5b50\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5730\u5c06\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u673a\u68b0\u632f\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u9a71\u52a8\u8154QED\u7684\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u68b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86mixing quantum systems\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7strong driving\u4fc3\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001 transfer\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86 cavity QED \u548c optomechanics \u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently emerged as a promising solution to improve readout accuracy . Prior hardware implementations of DNN-based readout are resource-intensive and suffer from high inference latency, limiting their practical use in low-latency decoding and quantum error correction (QEC) loops. This paper proposes LUNA, a fast and efficient superconducting qubit readout accelerator that combines low-cost integrator-based preprocessing with Look-Up Table (LUT) based neural networks for classification. The architecture uses simple integrators for dimensionality reduction with minimal hardware overhead, and employs LogicNets (DNNs synthesized into LUT logic) to drastically reduce resource usage while enabling ultra-low-latency inference. We integrate this with a differential evolution based exploration and optimization framework to identify high-quality design points. Our results show up to a 10.95x reduction in area and 30% lower latency with little to no loss in fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art. LUNA enables scalable, low-footprint, and high-speed qubit readout, supporting the development of larger and more reliable quantum computing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The second protocol updates parameters after collecting measurements from definite-outcome circuits (e.g.~syndrome extraction circuits for quantum error correction), balancing efficiency with classical control overheads. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that both methods can calibrate 1- and 2-qubit gates rapidly and accurately even in the presence of decoherence, state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and parameter drift. We propose and demonstrate effective adaptive strategies for tuning the hyperparameters of both protocols.

The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. In this work, we demonstrate a physically meaningful way to compare a pair of quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps. More precisely, given a pair of quantum channels and an arbitrary unknown input state, we show that if the output state of one quantum channel from the pair can be obtained from the output statistics of the other channel from the pair using some quantum measurement, then the latter channel from the pair can be obtained from the former channel by concatenating it with a Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear map.
