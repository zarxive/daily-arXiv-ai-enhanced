Nonlocal effects induce Yukawa screening, which shifts the event horizon inward and modifies both the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and the Hawking temperature, while also renormalizing the chemical potential. Nonlocal corrections also reduce the magnitude of the negative specific heat, making small hairy black holes more stable, with Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies consistent with the absence of first-order phase transitions. The nonlocal spin-2 propagator contains, in addition to the massless graviton, a massive pole with positive residue and positive norm. Consequently, hairy black holes in nonlocal quadratic gravity are free of ghost instabilities at the quadratic and classical levels, in the effective field theory."}

Agents combine a private exploratory behavior and a social imitation consisting in aligning to their neighbors, and weigh the two contributions with a single ``trust\" parameter that controls their relative influence. We find that an optimal trust parameter exists even in the absence of olfactory information, as was observed in the original model. Optimality is dictated by the need to explore the minimal region of space that contains the target. An optimal trust parameter emerges from this constraint because it it tunes imitation, which induces a collective mechanism of inertia affecting the size and path of the swarm. We predict the optimal trust parameter for cohesive groups where all agents interact with one another. We show how optimality depends on the initialization of the agents and the unknown location of the target, in close agreement with numerical simulations. Our results may be leveraged to optimize the design of swarm robotics or to understand information integration in organisms with decentralized nervous systems such as cephalopods."}

However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase.

Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape.

Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought."}

Datawell wave buoys are widely deployed around the world and have long served as a trusted standard for wave measurements. We quantify the measurement performance, including wave elevation and energy flux estimation, of a Datawell DWR-MkIII buoy using prescribed monochromatic heave motions on a large-amplitude six-degree-of-freedom motion platform at the National Laboratory of the Rockies, assuming the buoy behaves as an ideal wave follower. Commanded motions were validated with an optical motion tracking system while buoy elevation and raw acceleration were recorded. Wave elevations were propagated to wave energy flux estimation using four methods, including one frequency-domain method and three time-domain methods. The Bayesian optimization was applied for design of experiments, and records from three test sites were also applied and evaluated in the present study. Results show two error regions within the nominal period range of 1.6s to 30s}. For wave periods between 5s and 25s, the buoy provides accurate wave height measurements. For short periods less than 5s, the 1.28Hz sampling frequency induces sub-Nyquist artifacts that bias elevation and can drive maximum energy flux estimation errors above 100%. For long periods exceeding 25s, the buoy reported elevation is underpredicted with error depending on period but relatively independent of wave height, with maximum wave height and wave energy flux errors reaching 64% and 87%, respectively. The analysis of field data also indicates that the currently recommended method for estimating wave energy flux may underestimate the wave energy flux."}

GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-Å all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references.

Wing morphing is performed by Macro Fiber Composites (MFC) mini-piezoelectric actuators distributed along the span of the ''Reduced Scale'' (RS) A320 prototype of the H2020 No 723402 European research project SMS, ''Smart Morphing and Sensing for aeronautical configurations'', (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723402 and www.smartwing.org/SMS/EU). The configuration studied corresponds to a low-subsonic regime (Mach number 0.063) with a 10 degree incidence and a Reynolds number of 1 Million. The numerical simulations are carried out with the Navier-Stokes Multi-Block (NSMB) solver, which takes into account the deformation of the rear part of the wing implemented experimentally with the piezoelectric actuators. A detailed physical analysis of the morphing effects on the wake dynamics and on the aerodynamic performance is conducted with a constant amplitude of 0.7cm over a wide range of actuation frequencies [10-600]Hz. Optimal vibration ranges of [180-192]Hz and [205-215]Hz were found to respectively provide a 1% drag reduction and a 2% lift-to-drag ratio increase compared to the non-morphing (static) configuration. The natural frequencies associated with the shear layer Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices and the Von-Karman (VK) vortex shedding were found to play a central role in the modification of the wake dynamics by morphing as well as in the increase of the aerodynamic performance. Actuating at (or close to) the upper shear layer (USL) natural frequency (~185Hz) provides an order of 1% drag reduction and 1% lift-to-drag ratio increase, while actuating at (or close to) the lower shear layer (LSL) natural frequency (~208Hz) provides an order of 8% lift increase and 2% lift-to-drag increase. Furthermore, the linear variation of the actuation frequency over time, called wobulation, was shown to have significant effects. This approach demonstrated, through an appropriate mapping, the ability to quickly and efficiently detect optimal constant actuation frequency ranges providing aerodynamic performance increase and simultaneously reducing the amplitude of the main instability modes."}

However, due to nutrient depletion, mechanical constraints, or other limitations, exponential proliferation is not indefinite, and the spreading slows. Here, we theoretically explore a fundamental question: is it possible to infer the dominant limitation type from the spreading dynamics? Using a continuum active fluid model, we consider three limitations to cell proliferation: intrinsic growth arrest (e.g., due to sporulation), pressure from other cells, and nutrient access. We find that memoryless growth arrest still results in superlinear (accelerating) spreading, but at a reduced rate. In contrast, pressure-limited growth results in linear (constant-speed) spreading in the long-time limit. We characterize how the expansion speed depends on the maximum growth rate, the limiting pressure value, and the effective fluid friction. Interestingly, nutrient-limited growth results in a phase transition: depending on the nutrient supply and how efficiently nutrient is converted to biomass, the spreading can be either superlinear or sublinear (decelerating). We predict the phase boundary in terms of these parameters and confirm with simulations. Thus, our results suggest that when an expansion slowdown is observed, its dominant cause is likely nutrient depletion. More generally, our work suggests that cell-level growth limitations can be inferred from population-level dynamics, and it offers a methodology for connecting these two scales."}

We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $Λ$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors."}

High-yield, wafer-level batch fabrication of precision calorimetric sensor chips, beamline and laboratory cryostat plugins with sensor mounting and packaging are described. Using our calorimetric sensors, we present specific heat measurements on samples with masses ranging from 4 μg to 145 μg. The sample and reference cells are characterized with relaxation and ac steady-state measurements. The thermal response is captured using lock-in detection at carefully optimized measurement frequencies, with phase-lag correction ensuring precise extraction of heat capacity. The reference cell's background heat capacity was measured to be under 320 nJ/K at 300 K, decreasing to just 0.4 nJ/K at 0.7 K. The calorimeter performance is illustrated by studying the specific heat of small samples of superconducting Nb and a 4 μg piece of superconducting Al under different magnetic field strengths. The determination of fundamental thermodynamic quantities from low-temperature electronic and lattice specific heat measurements is discussed. These versatile, high-throughput sample platforms are engineered for small-sample calorimetry across a broad cryogenic temperature range, and they support scalable integration with a wide range of cryostats, including beamline cryostats at the Advanced Photon Source.

However, the physical nature of this interaction has remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations. Notably, the interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects. Accordingly, the bond formed between PsH units, termed here a two-positron gluonic bond to emphasize its fundamentally distinct character from the two-positron covalent bonds present in pure antimatter molecules, emerges only when matter and antimatter particles form a common bound state. When classified within the framework of known bonding mechanisms, this gluonic bond falls into the category of stabilizing dispersion interactions, giving rise to a van der Waals complex. However, its remarkably large bond dissociation energy, compared with those of strongly bonded van der Waals complexes of similar size, reveals an anomalously strong interaction. For this reason, we propose that (PsH)2 is most appropriately described as a \"super\" van der Waals complex stabilized by a \"super\" van der Waals bond."}

Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions.

Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the Rényi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve.

Here, we study a simple dynamical model of a microbial community in which species interact by competing for the uptake of common metabolites that are leaked by other species. The model includes coupled dynamics of species populations and chemical concentrations in the medium, allowing for a variety of uptake and leakage networks among species. Depending on the structure of these networks, the system exhibits different attractors, including fixed points, limit cycles, low-dimensional chaos, and high-dimensional chaos. In the fixed-point and limit-cycle cases, the number of coexisting species is bounded by the number of exchangeable chemicals, consistent with the well-known competitive exclusion principle. In contrast, in the low-dimensional chaotic regime, the number of coexisting species exhibits noticeable but limited excess over this limit. Remarkably, in the high-dimensional chaotic regime, a much larger number of species beyond this limit coexist persistently over time. In this case, the rank-abundance distribution is broader than exponential, as often observed in real ecosystems. The population dynamics displays intermittent switching among quasi-stationary states, while the chemical dynamics explore most of the high dimensions. We find that such high-dimensional chaos is ubiquitous when the number of uptake chemicals is moderately larger than the number of leaked chemicals. Our results identify high-dimensional chaos with intermittent switching as a generic dynamical mechanism that stabilizes coexistence in interacting systems. We discuss its relevance to sustaining diverse microbial communities with leak-uptake cross-feeding."}

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering."}

We derive the Boltzmann distribution from a minimal differential scaling postulate and show that sustaining thermal equilibrium demands continuous photon exchange with average energy $\\langle hν\\rangle = 2.701\\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput necessary to counter radiative losses. Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium.

To be submitted to Jinst", "summary": "Future high-energy physics experiments using SiPMs as photosensitive elements may require operation at low temperatures (down to 80 K) to measure single photons with high time resolution in a highly radioactive environment. This calls for a complete characterization of these sensors over a wide temperature range to find the best compromise between detector performance and cooling requirements. This paper presents the design of a transimpedance amplifier featuring high gain ($\\sim 7500$ $\\mathrm{V/A}$), very high speed ($ < 500$ $\\mathrm{ps}$ rise time) and low input noise ($\\lesssim 0.2$ $\\mathrm{pA/\\sqrt{Hz}}$), able to faithfully reproduce all the features of SiPM signals with very low noise and time jitter. These features make the amplifier suitable for precise measurements of the time-of-arrival of single-photon signals, as well as gain and recovery time. This article provides a detailed and thorough analysis of the circuit. The network was simulated and measured in two configurations that differ in their open-loop gain and dominant pole frequencies. After selecting the best configuration for our purposes, the amplifier was characterized in detail at ambient temperature and at 80 K. Finally, we evaluated the amplifier using a SiPM operated at low over-voltage. While SiPMs are typically characterized at high over-voltage to enhance gain and minimize timing jitter, testing at low over-voltage allowed us to assess the amplifier's performance under more challenging and realistic conditions for single-photon timing."}

Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-Å all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\\% under loose and 33.4\\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments. Collectively, these results establish GeoOpt-Net as a scalable, physically consistent geometry refinement framework that enables efficient acceleration of DFT-based quantum-chemical workflows."}

The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance.

This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport.

Using the microscopic scattering approach, we study the Casimir-Polder interaction between two atomic arrays, and uncover an unconventional distance scaling in which the force crosses over from a faster decay at short separations to a slower decay in the retarded regime. This behavior originates from the discrete lattice structure and can be consistently understood within the scattering picture. Extending our analysis to Rydberg atomic arrays, we predict an even stronger deviation from conventional scaling and propose an experimentally feasible scheme for direct measurement.

Ab-initio calculations, which explicitly take into account coupled electron-nuclear dynamics induced by the pump and the multiphoton nature of the probe-induced ionization step, reproduced the observed delay in the yield.

However, SPE creation in 2D semiconductors on rigid substrates like SiO2/Si via nanoindentation is a technological gap, critical for interfacing SPEs with photonic circuits and cavities. Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths > 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 μeV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs. Our work is directly applicable to other 2D materials and photonic circuit/cavity compatible rigid substrates and is a significant step for scalable SPE technologies."}

In the isotropic case ($Δ=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $Δ$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $Δ$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model."}

This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J.

To address these limitations, we present a unified variational framework that extends CIS by incorporating orbital optimization (state-specific and state-averaged), linear-response orbital relaxation via double-CIS schemes, and spin-symmetry breaking and restoration. In spin-projected state-averaged formulations, standard multistate parametrizations are no longer valid because the projection operator breaks the unitary invariance of orbital rotations and induces nonorthogonal couplings among states. By formulating a rigorous state-averaged objective in the projected subspace, we derive analytic gradients and Hessians and enable robust optimization using a trust-region augmented Hessian algorithm. Benchmark calculations show that spin projection alone significantly exacerbates the CIS overestimation in weakly correlated systems, whereas combining spin projection with state averaging or double-CI corrections substantially reduces errors, particularly for Rydberg excitations. We further demonstrate that state averaging and spin projection provide complementary and essential benefits in strongly correlated regimes, as illustrated by the bond dissociation of hydrogen fluoride."}

We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations. Numerical simulations on the lattice support the predictions from the continuum model."}

We show that inelastic scattering amplitudes are governed by overlap integrals between static modes at the input and output frequencies. Using this insight, we analyze scattering from a time-modulated, isotropic, dielectric sphere and a high-permittivity dielectric cylinder, and demonstrate how modal orthogonality can suppress inelastic channels, while appropriate tuning of geometric parameters can significantly enhance them. In particular, we show that cylindrical resonators support strong inelastic scattering when resonance-to-resonance optical transitions, induced by the temporal variation, involve a high-Q supercavity mode. Comparison with full time-Floquet calculations confirms that the first-order Born approximation remains quantitatively accurate for modest modulation amplitudes and provides clear physical intuition for frequency conversion and resonance-mediated scattering processes in time-modulated photonic resonators."}

Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices."}

We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $μ$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$. To ensure the consistency of the thermodynamic description, the conserved charges and the first law in the ultraspinning limit are derived using the Iyer-Wald formalism together with integrability conditions."}

However, the physical nature of this interaction has remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations. Notably, the interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects. Accordingly, the bond formed between PsH units, termed here a two-positron gluonic bond to emphasize its fundamentally distinct character from the two-positron covalent bonds present in pure antimatter molecules, emerges only when matter and antimatter particles form a common bound state. When classified within the framework of known bonding mechanisms, this gluonic bond falls into the category of stabilizing dispersion interactions, giving rise to a van der Waals complex. However, its remarkably large bond dissociation energy, compared with those of strongly bonded van der Waals complexes of similar size, reveals an anomalously strong interaction. For this reason, we propose that (PsH)2 is most appropriately described as a \"super\" van der Waals complex stabilized by a \"super\" van der Waals bond."}

Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials."}

We introduce a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic lattice based on a modulated Hatano-Nelson model and uncover a new universality class of quasiperiodic skin criticality, in which all eigenstates share an identical multifractal spatial structure. Through a nonunitary gauge transformation, the system is mapped onto a disorder-free lattice, enabling exact analytical solutions for the full spectrum and eigenstates. As a consequence, the inverse participation ratio is strictly energy-independent and controlled solely by a global phase. We further show that this criticality persists in multiband lattices, establishing a general and analytically controlled framework for non-Hermitian quasiperiodic critical phenomena."}

The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. With the success in demonstrating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an alternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest. In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(2)}$, SFWM can generate photon pairs both directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(3)}$, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN). The existence of both second- and third-order nonlinear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum state engineering."}

In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code.

We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes.

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions. As the Rashba coupling is renormalized by the moire pattern, it induces helicity fragmentation, in which the helicity weight is distributed across a dense manifold of moire minibands, forming an extended network of helicity carrying states and significantly enhancing helicity fluctuations at the bare response level. The emergence of Dirac like miniband crossings at finite spin orbit interaction demonstrates that moire heterostructures can support relativistic quasiparticles through band reconstruction. This model provides a microscopic mechanism by which proximity induced spin orbit coupling can be amplified via moire engineering."}

In contrast with previously studied two-edge geometries, the weak backscattering regime is dominated by the first-order perturbative term, allowing quantum transport quantities to factorize into a non-universal prefactor and a braiding-induced contribution that provides direct access to the universal statistical angle $πλ$. While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $λ$ and on the capacitance of the loop. Our results indicate that a reliable extraction of the statistical angle requires a parallel measurement of the loop capacitance, which can be implemented via a charged gate coupled to the junction."}

The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance.

We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport.

While previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016 for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tadpole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check."}

Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought."}

The results show that the excitation of TiO2 microspheres (diameter, d approx. 1 um) under TFGB illumination leads to the appearance of scattering minima in both the forward and backward directions within specific wavelength ranges. These scattering minima are found to be due to vanishing electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients associated with hybrid optical anapoles. The ability to confine electromagnetic fields associated with hybrid optical anapoles can give rise to several novel optical phenomena and applications."}

Random quantum states sampled from a uniform distribution, the Haar measure, provide a powerful framework for capturing this typicality. Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the Rényi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve. Second, we probe the subsystem symmetries using entanglement asymmetry. Finally, we measure the moments of partially transposed reduced density matrices obtained by tracing out part of the system in the generated ensembles, thereby revealing distinct entanglement phases.

The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime.

The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (α) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (α) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (α) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (α) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (α\\in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (α) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (α) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordström black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties."}

While its universal manifestation is a net change of proper distances, gravitational-wave detectors are intrinsically insensitive to the final offset and can only probe the associated transition. A central challenge for any claim of detection therefore lies in defining a physically meaningful and operationally robust model of this time-dependent signal, which is uniquely attributable to gravitational memory and distinguishable from purely oscillatory radiation. In this work, we propose a general solution to this challenge. Building on a self-contained review of the theory of gravitational memory, we discuss a theoretical framework for defining and modeling a gravitational memory rise, in particular applicable to compact binary coalescences. Specializing to space-based detectors, we analyze the response of LISA to gravitational radiation including a memory contribution, with particular emphasis on mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which offer the most promising prospects for a first single-event detection. The framework developed here provides the theoretical foundation for statistically well-defined hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-full radiation and quantitative assessments of detection prospects.

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state."}

This opens the door for equilibration where the two coupled Bose-Hubbard systems, which are initially in different thermal states, relax to the same thermal state.

To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture integrating Convolutional and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CNN-BiLSTM). This design leverages CNNs for local feature extraction and BiLSTMs for sequential dependency modeling, enabling robust feature learning from minimal training data. We investigate two fusion paradigms: Architecture 1 (flattening-based) and Architecture 2 (dimensionality-transforming). When trained on only 100 samples, Architecture 2 maintains classification accuracies exceeding 90% for both 3-qubit and 4-qubit systems, demonstrating rapid loss convergence within tens of epochs. Under full-data conditions (400 000 samples), both architectures achieve accuracies above 99.97%. Comparative benchmarks reveal that our CNN-BiLSTM models, especially Architecture 2, consistently outperform standalone CNNs, BiLSTMs, and MLPs in low-data regimes, albeit with increased training time.

QEM strategies based on agnostic noise amplification (ANA) are intrinsically resilient to such noise variations, but their sampling cost remains a major practical bottleneck. Here we introduce a mitigation framework that combines virtual noise scaling with a layered mitigation architecture, yielding orders of magnitude reduction in runtime overhead compared to conventional zero-noise extrapolation post-processing. The proposed approach is compatible with dynamic circuits and can be seamlessly integrated with error detection and quantum error correction schemes. In addition, it naturally extends to ANA-based mitigation of mid-circuit measurements and preparation errors.

As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016 for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tadpole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all three diagrams.

Two specific examples concern the transition from pure to mixed states in two different universality classes of dynamics in one dimension, one being the exponential model, the other the Dyson model, the dynamics of the latter exhibiting strong graphical evidence of quantum chaos, as a consequence of the results of Albert and Kiessling on the Cloitre function."}

To survive in a realistic noisy environment, magic states must be prepared fault-tolerantly and protected by a quantum error-correcting code. The recent discovery of highly efficient quantum low-density parity-check codes, together with efficient logic gates, lays the groundwork for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation. This motivates the search for fast and parallel protocols for logical magic state preparation to enable universal quantum computation. Here, we introduce a fast code surgery procedure that performs a fault-tolerant measurement of many transversal logic gates in parallel. This is achieved by performing a generalized gauging measurement on a quantum code that supports a higher-form transversal gate. The time overhead of our procedure is constant, and the qubit overhead is linear. The procedure inherits fault-tolerance properties from the base code and the structure of the higher-form transversal gate. When applied to codes that support higher-form Clifford gates our procedure achieves fast and fault-tolerant preparation of many magic states in parallel. This motivates the search for good quantum low-density parity-check codes that support higher-form Clifford gates."}

However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis. Implemented as a quantum reservoir, the architecture achieves improved Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy and confidence via increased data separability. Our approach paves the way toward high-capacity quantum machine learning using memristive devices compatible with linear-optical quantum computing."}

A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime.

The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and beyond, for instance in the computation of the injective tensor norm in multilinear algebra. Here, we introduce a method to determine the maximal overlap of a pure multiparticle quantum state with product states based on considering several copies of the pure state. This leads to three types of hierarchical approximations to the problem, all of which we prove to converge to the actual value. Besides allowing for the computation of the geometric measure of entanglement, our results can be used to tackle optimizations over stochastic local transformations, to find entanglement witnesses for weakly entangled bipartite states, and to design strong separability tests for mixed multiparticle states.

The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. With the success in demonstrating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an alternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest. In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(2)}$, SFWM can generate photon pairs both directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(3)}$, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN).

Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist.
