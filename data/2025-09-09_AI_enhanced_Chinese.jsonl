This phenomenon is understood\nby the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced\npartitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for\na theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic\nfields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the\nfield region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a\nnonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of\ndifferent magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase\nregion does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does.\nWe tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat\nmeasurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the\ntwo-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking\nof magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic\nspin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that\noccur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements.

The spin MOSFET device has an 8-nm-thick p-Si channel with a back\ngate (G) and ferromagnetic source / drain (S/D) junctions consisting of\nFe/Mg/MgO/SiOx/n+-Si. In addition to transistor characteristics with an on-off\nratio of 104, clear spin-valve signals and Hanle spin precession signals were\nobserved at 4 K in a wide range of the source-to-gate V_GS and source-to-drain\nV_DS bias voltages.

Our spin transport model for our spin MOSFET structure was\nimproved in this study by taking into account the electron distribution and\nband profile of the n+-Si regions in the ferromagnetic S/D junctions, which\nenables the accurate estimation of P_S.

To be submitted for\n  publication at Physical Review E, an APS journal", "summary": "The $\\textit{Caenorhabditis Elegans}$ ($\\textit{C.elegans}$) nematodes have\nlong been a model organism for quantitative behavioral analysis, due to their\ntractable nervous system and well-characterized genetics. In particular,\ndynamic diffraction has been a successful method of studying said\nmicroorganisms due to its low level of noise and the ability to simultaneously\nstudy multiple degrees of freedom of their neuromuscular system through their\nlocomotion. In this study, we estimate the Lyapunov spectrum of\n$\\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion, which offers an insight into how volume\nelements evolve in the phase space of the underlying dynamical system. For\nthat, we used the Sano-Sawada algorithm to estimate the spectra from the\ntrajectories reconstructed using the Takens embedding procedure. In total, two\npositive and one negative exponents were calculated and verified to be\nnon-spurious through investigations of their stability for different sets of\nparameters. Those exponents have values of $0.860 \\pm 0.028$, $0.389 \\pm\n0.014$, and $-3.451 \\pm 0.074$ respectively. The presence of two positive\nexponents indicates that $\\textit{C.elegans}$ locomotion is hyperchaotic, while\nthe total sum being negative indicates that the system is dissipative and\nnon-Hamiltonian. Those are key observations for the underlying system and will\nbe significant for the potential creation of future mathematical or\ncomputational models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u866b\u8f6e\u866b\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u73b0\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u91cd\u6784\u7ef4\u6570\u7b26\u5408\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u52a8\u6001\u6563\u6591\u6280\u672f\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 takens \u63d2\u503c\u91cd\u6784\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\u540e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 sano-sawada \u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u51fa\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u8c31\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u603b\u548c\u4e3a\u8d1f\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u603b\u4f53\u662f\u8017\u6563\u7684\u800c\u975e hamiltonian . \u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u59cb\u7ec8\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e nervous \u7cfb\u7edf\u6216\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1 lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u8c31\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5224\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u957f\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6210\u866b\u8f6e\u866b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u673a\u68b0\u523a\u6fc0\u83b7\u5f97\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5229\u7528 takens \u63d2\u503c\u5b9a\u7406\u91cd\u6784\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528 sano-sawada \u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176 lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u8c31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\uff09\u591a\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u5f97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u786e\u8ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684 lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u8c31\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a0.860 \u00b1 0.028\uff0c0.389 \u00b1 0.014\uff0c-3.451 \u00b1 0.074\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u4e24\u6b63\u4e00\u8d1f\u7684 lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u53cc\u66f2\u578b chaos\uff0c\u5373\u53cc\u66f2\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5178\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u8017\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728 nervous \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c1a\u5c5e\u9996\u6b21\u88ab\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603b lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u4e4b\u548c\u4e3a\u8d1f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8017\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u975e hamiltonian \u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728 nervous \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u66f2\u578b chaos \u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u51fa\u6210\u866b\u8f6e\u866b\u7684\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u6307\u6570\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53cc\u66f2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b lyapunov \u6307\u6570\u4e3a\u8d1f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u6709\u8017\u6563\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3 nervous \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The high-contrast and wide magnification\nrange of NegC-SEM imaging enabled the capture of micro- and nanoscopic\nhierarchical branching structures of CNFs. Two ML approaches [Weka and U-Net]\nwere used to create detailed binary segmentation of grayscale NegC-SEM images,\ncritical for the width analysis. Morphological thinning was applied to the\nbinary image to produce a 1-pixel-wide skeleton of the CNF fibril structure.\nSubsequently, the distance between the skeleton and the original fibril edge\nwas used to calculate fibril width. The FACT framework was optimized and\nvalidated with idealized geometric and hierarchical branched structures. FACT\neffectively performed segmentation, skeletonization, and fibril width\nmeasurement of these CNF morphologies. FACT width results were comparable with\nmanual measurements. In the manual method, a single measurement is made per\nfibril. In contrast, FACT simultaneously makes multiple measurements along each\nfibril within the entire CNF branched network structure.

This work sheds light on the wave localization in the\nnon-Hermitian optical wave systems in general, and illustrates, in particular,\nfor the first time, the existence of a surface Peregrine soliton mode at the\ncross-field synergistic point of nonlinear optics, non-Hermitian physics, and\ntopological wave phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u9762\u4f69\u91cc\u683c\u56e0\u5b64\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6253\u7834\u548c\u5df2\u6253\u7834\u7684PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7279\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u8bb8\u591a\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u9762\u4f69\u91cc\u683c\u56e0\u5b64\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u9762\u4f69\u91cc\u683c\u56e0\u5b64\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u672a\u6253\u7834\u7684PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5df2\u6253\u7834\u7684PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8868\u9762\u4f69\u91cc\u683c\u56e0\u5b64\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we\nfind no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to\ncurrent direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to\noriginate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the\n[100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties\nof the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find\nevidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface\ncrossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at\nthe surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel,\nwhich is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong\ntopological insulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2 and finds evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, which is inconsistent with lower-dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator.

Greene"], "title": "Mechanisms of Anomalous Three-Body Loss in a Population Imbalanced Three-Component Fermi Gas", "comment": null, "summary": "Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed\nunderstanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body\ndecay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work\ninvestigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The\nthree-body Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic\nrepresentation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is\nobtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate\ncoefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength\nwhere the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the\nthreshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally\naveraged $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the\nexperiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ also\nexplicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi\nenergies $E_{F}^{(i)}\\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy\nis reduced, $\\langle K_3 \\rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and\nbecomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and\ncross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary\ncollisions and trap escape.

In this work,\nwe investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge\nmodel by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum\ndissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained\nmore robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This\ndissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of\ninitial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned\nconfigurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with\ndecoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for\nstabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum

In this paper, we consider a novel\ncoupling that incorporates additional time dependence that reflects the\ncosmological expansion, as motivated by structures that appear in quantum\ncosmology. We focus on a conformal scalar field in a de Sitter\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with flat but compact\nspatial sections in 3+1 dimensions, and a comoving Unruh-DeWitt detector: the\nnovel coupling posits the detector to couple to the scaled scalar field that\nappears in the conformally related static spacetime. We survey the differences\nbetween the conventional and novel coupling, for detectors that couple to the\nfull field and detectors that couple only to specific field modes, and for\ndetectors with proper time internal dynamics and detectors with conformal time\ninternal dynamics. We also briefly discuss noncompact spatial sections and\nsingle-mode detectors with discontinuous time dependence. We find that the\nnovel coupling tends to enhance the de-excitation peaks in the detector's\nresponse, particularly for single-mode detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8026\u5408\u7684 detectors\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u964d\u6fc0\u53d1\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6784\u5efa\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5206\u6790\u573a\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8026\u5408\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u964d\u6fc0\u53d1\u5cf0\u503c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u622a\u65ad\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5c40\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

This ``operator asymmetry,'' formalized as the\nasymmetry norm, leads to a variance-based uncertainty relation for pure states\nthat can be tighter than the standard Robertson bound, especially in the\nnear-compatible regime. Most significantly, this framework resolves a\nlong-standing open problem in quantum information theory: the formulation of a\nuniversally valid, product-form uncertainty relation for the Wigner-Yanase skew\ninformation. We demonstrate the practical power of our framework by deriving\ntighter quantum speed limits for the dynamics of nearly conserved quantities,\nwhich are crucial for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena such as\nprethermalization and many-body localization.

Furthermore,\nhigh-temperature implantation improves NV$^-$ creation yields up to five times\nwithout compromising T2$^*$, T2 and T1, making it a promising approach to\nenhance the magnetic field sensitivity of NV$^-$ ensembles.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the effects of high-temperature ion implantation on diamond-based NV^- ensembles, demonstrating that 800\u00b0C implantation can maintain structural integrity without amorphization and improve magnetic field sensitivity.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this work is the need to enhance the performance and reliability of diamond-based quantum sensors by optimizing NV^- ensemble properties through ion implantation techniques.", "method": "The study employed ion implantation at different temperatures and fluences, measuring the impact on diamond's structural integrity and NV^- properties through temperature-dependent experiments.", "result": "The research reveals that high-temperature (800\u00b0C) ion implantation successfully maintains diamond's structural integrity at high fluences without amorphization, with enhanced magnetic field sensitivity.", "conclusion": "This study provides valuable insights into the optimization of NV^- ensembles for quantum sensors by demonstrating that high-temperature ion implantation can effectively mitigate structural damage and improve sensor performance."}}

In the\nabsence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the\nspectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized\nline for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$\nchain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon\nmodes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$\nchains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we\ndisentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After\nincluding the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution\nof the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the\nHaldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation\nspectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the\norder of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the\nline of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined,\nand the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from\nthe transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across\nthe phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases,\nrevealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase\ntransitions.

We discover\nthat the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the\nmagnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic\ninteractions in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes\nstringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined,\nquantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state\nand its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation\ncontinua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\\Gamma$ is\nconsistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a\nsixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\\sim 16$ meV that cannot be\nexplained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of\nfractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics.

Decomposing the tensor into its\nsymmetric and antisymmetric components allows us to identify isotropic,\nanisotropic, and chiral contributions to the magnetic inertia. Using linear\nspin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum consists of two precessional magnon\nbands and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional magnon\nband crosses the lower inertial magnon band within the Brillouin zone. We show\nthat both cross-sublattice inertia and chiral inertia provide effective tuning\nknobs for these magnon band structures.

The system supports both real and imaginary persistent\ncurrents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current\ncomponents, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments.

We study a dataset of 58 small organic molecules and the\ndissociation curve of N2, and demonstrate that an active space constructed from\norbitals derived from larger basis sets captures correlation effects more\neffectively.

Our approach is generalizable to\nother valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to\ndiscover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\\'e materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u83ab\u5c14\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u83ab\u5c14\u5e26\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u83ab\u5c14\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5982\u6258\u5c14_dirac\u6216\u62d3\u6251\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u83ab\u5c14\u80fd\u9699\u5c0f\u4e8e\u539f\u5b50\u5206\u7acb\u80fd\u5728\u83ab\u5c14\u5e03\u91ccouin\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u8c37\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u83ab\u5c14\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u8d23\u65e0\u65c1\u8d37\u3002\u83ab\u5c14\u5e26\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u83ab\u5c14\u5e26\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u5408\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u7fa4\u8bba\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u83ab\u5c14\u7fa4\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u83ab\u5c14\u5e26\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u83ab\u5c14\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u83ab\u5c14\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\uff0c\u5982\u6258\u5c14_dirac\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u8bba\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u5143\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u83ab\u5c14\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6269\u5927\u4e86 discovery\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

I propose\ninstead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near\ngravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly\nnon-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field\nengage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity,\nachieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is\ndominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime\nand enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through\nsingularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard\nModel (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions,\nfails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By\ncontrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted\ni(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional\ncomponent of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the\nempirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking\nnew phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes\n(on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the\nclassical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black\nhole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant\ngeneralizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string\ntheory, and unified models of fundamental interactions.

While recent progress has been made, mitigating environmental\nnoise remains a challenge in extracting particle parameters with high fidelity.\nAddressing these challenges requires efforts on two levels. At the device\nlevel, the qubit and its array acting as a probe, must be isolated from\nelectrical and magnetic noise through optimized device geometry. At the\nsignal-processing level, it is necessary to develop filtering methods targeting\nspecific noise spectra based on different qubit architectures. In this work, we\nexplore the possibility of using semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits as a\nplatform to search for quantum chromodynamics axions and, more broadly, axion\nlike particles (ALPs). Starting by deriving an effective Hamiltonian for\nelectron-axion interactions, we identify an axion-induced effective magnetic\nfield and determine the characteristic axion oscillation frequency. To suppress\ncharge noise in the devices and environmental noise, we first analyze the\ncharge noise spectrum and then develop a dedicated filtering and\nnoise-reduction protocol, paving the way for exploring feasible axion mass\nranges.

The PPT condition is\nexpressed in terms of the inequality between the second-order moment of the\nsystem's partial transposition $(p_2)$ and the reciprocal of the product of\n$d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. The second order moment $(p_{2})$ plays a vital role in\ndetecting the PPT states as it is very easy to calculate and may be a\nrealizable quantity in an experiment. Once we know that the given state is a\nPPT state, we will use a suitable witness operator to detect whether the given\nPPT state is a PPTES. Further, we have established a relation between the\nsecond and third order moments of partial transposition of a PPT state and have\nshown that the violation of the inequality implies that the detected state is a\nnegative partial transpose (NPT) entangled state. We will then construct a\nquantum state by considering the mixture of a separable and an entangled state\nand obtain a condition on the mixing parameter for which the mixture represents\na PPT entangled state.

The proposed architecture combines dimensionality reduction\n(via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX\nHamiltonian, and measurement, providing features for a single-layer classifier.\nBy analyzing the performance of QELMs as a function of the evolution time, we\nidentify a relatively sharp transition from a low-accuracy to a high-accuracy\nregime, after which the accuracy saturates. Remarkably, the saturation value\nmatches that achieved with random unitaries, which induce maximally complex\ndynamics and optimally scramble information across the system. Across all cases\nstudied, the critical transition time is sufficient for information to reach\nnearest neighbors, enabling feature extraction for learning, and is independent\nof the system size (i.e., the number of qubits). This independence implies that\nQELMs can be efficiently simulated classically for a broad class of tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\uff08QELM\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u540e\u8d8b\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5355\u5143aries\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86QELM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "QELM\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5355\u5143aries\uff0c\u53ef\u88ab\u9ad8\u6548\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u786c\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002"}}
