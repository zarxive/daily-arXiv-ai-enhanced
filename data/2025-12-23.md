Abstract: Interfaces play a crucial role in energy transport at the nanoscale. However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions.

Abstract: Linear surprisal analysis is applied to state-to-state experimental results for the H-atom abstraction reaction, H + HI -> H2 + I. Contrary to previously reported results that indicated that the products from this reaction were not well fit by a linear surprisal, the reaction can be accurately described by linear surprisal parameters when kinematic energy constraints are taken into account. This is further evidence of the important role mass effects play in the energy disposal of state-to-state reactions and of the quantitative value of a very simple model to predict the maximum energy available to the internal states of the products.

Abstract: Quantum computers promise scalable treatments of electronic structure, yet applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) on realistic drug-like molecules remains constrained by the performance limitations of near-term quantum hardwares. A key strategy for addressing this challenge which effectively leverages current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares yet remains under-benchmarked is active space selection. We introduce a benchmark that heuristically proposes criteria based on chemically grounded metrics to classify the suitability of a molecule for using quantum computing and then quantifies the impact of active space choices across the VQE pipeline for quantum drug discovery. The suite covers several representative drug-like molecules (e.g., lovastatin, oseltamivir, morphine) and uses chemically motivated active spaces. Our VQE evaluations employ both simulation and quantum processing unit (QPU) execution using unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) and hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA). We adopt a more comprehensive evaluation, including chemistry metrics and architecture-centric metrics. For accuracy, we compare them with classical quantum chemistry methods. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for active space driven VQE and lays the groundwork for future hardware-algorithm co-design studies in quantum drug discovery.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.

Abstract: One-dimensional NMR spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for the characterization of organic compounds and natural products. For molecules with up to 36 non-hydrogen atoms, the number of possible structures has been estimated to range from $10^{20} - 10^{60}$. The task of determining the structure (formula and connectivity) of a molecule of this size using only its one-dimensional $^1$H and/or $^{13}$C NMR spectrum, i.e. de novo structure generation, thus appears completely intractable. Here we show how it is possible to achieve this task for systems with up to 40 non-hydrogen atoms across the full elemental coverage typically encountered in organic chemistry (C, N, O, H, P, S, Si, B, and the halogens) using a deep learning framework, thus covering a vast portion of the drug-like chemical space. Leveraging insights from natural language processing, we show that our transformer-based architecture predicts the correct molecule with 55.2% accuracy within the first 15 predictions using only the $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra, thus overcoming the combinatorial growth of the chemical space while also being extensible to experimental data via fine-tuning.

### [6] [A Fixed-Volume Variant of Gibbs-Ensemble Monte Carlo Yields Significant Speedup in Binodal Calculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18899)
*Sanbo Qin,Huan-Xiang Zhou*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Fixed-volume Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo significantly accelerates binodal calculations for complex biomolecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding phase behavior of biomolecules is crucial, but accurate simulations are computationally intensive. Improving efficiency can enable broader applications.

Method: The fixed-volume GEMC method was developed by preventing volume exchange, instead relying on fluctuating number of particles and energy to explore configuration space.

Result: Results on Lennard-Jones and patchy particles demonstrate significant speedup without loss of accuracy in predicting binodals.

Conclusion: This advancement makes GEMC more feasible for studying phase behavior in proteins and other complex molecules.

Abstract: Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) is a powerful method for calculating the gas-liquid binodals of simple models and small molecules, but is too demanding computationally for realistic models of proteins. Here we discover that the main reason for long simulations is that volume exchange is very slow to achieve, and develop a variant GEMC without volume exchange. The key is to determine an appropriate initial density. Test of this fixed-volume GEMC method on Lennard-Jones and patchy particles shows enormous speedup without any loss of accuracy in predicted binodals. The fast speed of fixed-volume GEMC promises many applications.

Abstract: Chiroptical effects using circularly polarized light produce signals that change sign when switching either molecular handedness (enantiosensitivity) or the light helicity (circular dichroism). Here, we break this enantiosensitive-and-dichroic paradigm by measuring a new type of chiroptical signal which is enantiosensitive but not dichroic. We photoionize chiral molecules using a strong laser field and detect the three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution. The non-dichroic, enantiosensitive asymmetry is encoded in octupolar and higher multipolar terms in the photoelectron angular distribution, which appear in multiphoton ionization with elliptically polarized fields or cross polarized two-color fields. The robustness of the enantiosensitivity with respect to the relative phase between the vectorial components of the ionizing field represents an example of symmetry protection, and opens unexplored opportunities for imaging ultrafast dynamics in chiral molecules, such as enantiosensitive photoelectron spectroscopy with bright squeezed vacuum states.

Conclusion: MLatom framework is a valuable resource for advancing machine learning models and understanding nonadiabatic dynamics in molecular systems.

Abstract: Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is a key technique for investigating a broad range of photochemical and photophysical processes. Among the established approaches, surface hopping schemes are widely used and can be easily integrated with various quantum chemistry programs or machine learning models. We present a flexible framework in MLatom that includes a newly implemented Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping algorithm and its time-dependent Baeck--An variant. The capabilities of this framework are demonstrated through three representative examples corresponding to typical stages of a surface hopping study. First, we focus on methods providing energy, energy gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. We show that the flexibility of user-defined custom models can save computational time and that it is useful for benchmarking machine learning models. Next, we compare curvature-driven surface hopping schemes and show that Landau--Zener approach outperforms the time-dependent Baeck--An scheme. Finally, we showcase easy-to-use analysis tools for both individual trajectories and trajectory ensembles. This framework enables accelerated development of machine learning models and provides deeper insight into nonadiabatic dynamics. It is available as a part of the open-source MLatom package.

Result: B97M-V, ωB97M-V, and revDOD-PBEP86-D4 are top performers at mGGA, hybrid, and double-hybrid levels respectively. No satisfactory GGA functionals were found, but combining BLYP-D4 with a simple O-H bond correction achieves accuracy comparable to B97M-V.

Conclusion: This benchmark provides reliable guidelines for selecting functionals based on the required theory level and system specifics.

Abstract: A DFT benchmark on water including more than 50 functionals from GGA to double-hybrid levels is reported.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高核安全和环境监测工作的效率和准确性，探索无损测量放射性污染的方法，减少分装滤纸的更换成本，同时提高测量的可靠性。

Method: 采用了241Am作为替代物，利用其强的辐射特性（α和γ射线），在不损坏滤纸的前提下进行放射性测量，通过2D几何建模和对望远镜观察数据模拟来评估探测器的响应。同时，参考滤纸是在法国 IRSN 的 ICARE 测试台使用带有 241Am 标记的气态样品制造的，然后通过 CEA/LNHB 的参考计数器进行 γ 射线谱分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有的 137Cs/90Sr/90Y 和 239Pu 标记材料相比，使用 241Am 作为替代品提供了更高的测量精度和更低的不确定度。这使得在检测放射性污染时，可以避免更换分装滤纸的麻烦，从而提高监测工作的整体效率。

Conclusion: 基于上述研究，提出了使用241Am作为替代品的可能性，这种替代品不仅能够在不破坏滤纸的情况下实现放射性污染电信号的准确测量，还能够大大降低检测过程中的不确定性，从而大幅提升放射性污染的监测水平。这不仅在理论上实现了预期的目标，而且已经在实际应用中得到了验证，具有重要的工程应用价值。

Abstract: In nuclear safety and environmental studies, it is necessary to measure the activity of aerosols collected on filters. The calibration of these filters' measurement chains currently involves producing a reference filter with a controlled deposit of aerosol marked by a specific radionuclide. In France, commonly used radionuclides include 137 Cs for gamma or beta emitters, 90 Sr/ 90 Y for beta emitters, and 239 Pu for alpha emitters. However, using 239 Pu presents several issues, notably the destruction of the filter required to determine its traceable activity and the associated uncertainties. The challenge of this project is to propose a radionuclide enabling non-destructive, SI-traceable measurement while retaining the reference filter. The proposed radionuclide is 241 Am, which is both alpha and gamma-emitting and allows for precise non-destructive measurements. Reference filters are produced on the IRSN's ICARE test bench with calibrated aerosols tagged with 241 Am. The reference activity of theses filters is measured by gamma spectrometry on CEA/LNHB reference counter. A series of tests confirmed that 241 Am provides accurate activity determination with minimal uncertainty. Consequently, adopting 241 Am can significantly improve the reliability of radioactive contamination monitoring while avoiding practical challenges associated with plutonium.

Abstract: The PICOSEC Micromegas detector is a Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector concept developed to achieve tens of picosecond timing resolution for charged particle detection by combining a Cherenkov radiator with a two-stage Micromegas amplification structure. To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance.
  This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square.
  Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge. Muon beam tests with CsI and DLC photocathodes demonstrate a time resolution of 11.5 ps for CsI, comparable to 11.9 ps for the metallic-anode device, showing the suitability of the resistive design for precision timing applications.

Abstract: The next-generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$) searches are targeting half-life sensitivities towards 10$^{27}$--10$^{28}$ years. Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.

This ghost levitated particle is simulated on an analogue computer, and hence its prperties can be dynamically varied. Our work represents a new angle on measurement-based bath engineering and physical simulation, and in the future could lead to the generation of novel cooling mechanisms and complex physical simulation.

Abstract: The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $β$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $β$-spectrum endpoint of \SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \SI{0.2}{ppm} per \SI{1}{kV} single board and $\lesssim$ \SI{50}{mV} over the \SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \SI{0.05}{ppm} over \SI{20}{kV}.

Abstract: We present a microchannel plate detector for compact time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) that jointly optimizes the anode geometry and high-voltage AC-decoupling network for electrically floating operation. Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern.

Abstract: Accurate single photoelectron (SPE) characterization of photosensors is essential for controlling systematic uncertainties in low-light neutrino and dark matter detectors. We present a compact laboratory setup for the characterization of photosensors under controlled, low-light conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate its use with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operated at the SPE-level, using picosecond laser pulses and waveform digitization to determine key PMT properties. Measurements as a function of supply voltage and temperature ($-50^\circ$C to $+20^\circ$C) are performed on ET Enterprises 9821(Q)B tubes and a Hamamatsu R9980 assembly, which show exponential gain-voltage behavior and device-to-device variation. Cooling increases the gain by $\sim 0.1\,\%/^\circ$C, while the transit time spread (TTS) and peak-to-valley ratio (P/V) exhibit no clear temperature dependence. TTS decreases with voltage. Late pulses remain at the percent level and prepulses at the sub-percent level. Cable length affects both apparent gain and TTS. A model-independent, data-driven self-convolution method is introduced to quantify double photoelectron contributions from pulse charge spectra. The procedures provide a reproducible, practice-oriented reference for SPE-level PMT characterization and can be extended to other photosensor types.

Motivation: Understanding ultrafast optical excitations in semiconductors is crucial for advancing ultrafast optical control and related technologies.

Method: The study employs the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA), which is resource-efficient and provides insights into electron-hole populations and energy distribution.

Result: The analysis shows that two-photon processes are generally dominant, with one- and three-photon processes becoming significant under specific conditions related to pump-pulse frequency, duration, and intensity.

Conclusion: This comprehensive study offers practical guidelines for optimizing ultrafast optical control in semiconductors by targeting specific multi-photon pathways.

Abstract: We employ the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA) to investigate the ultrafast optical excitations of germanium under intense, ultrashort pump pulses. The method has very low resource demand relative to many other available approaches and enables detailed calculation of the residual electron and hole populations induced by the pump pulse. It provides direct access to the energy distribution of excited carriers and to the total energy transferred to the system. By decomposing the response into contributions from different multi-photon resonant processes, we systematically study the dependence of excited-carrier density and absorbed energy on key pump-pulse parameters: duration, amplitude, and photon energy. Our results reveal a complex interplay between these parameters, governed by resonant Rabi-like dynamics and competition between different multi-photon absorption channels. For the studied germanium setup, we find that two-photon processes are generally dominant, while one- and three-photon channels become significant under specific conditions of pump-pulse frequency, duration, and intensity. This comprehensive analysis offers practical insights for optimizing ultrafast optical control in semiconductors by targeting specific multi-photon pathways.

Motivation: Microscale manufacturing is crucial for microelectronics, yet current laser systems struggle with resolution. This study explores alternative laser methods for better resolution.

Method: The research uses UV nanosecond lasers to process copper nanoparticles, varying laser parameters and packing densities.

Result: Sub-20 micrometer resolution was achieved, leveraging shorter wavelengths.

Conclusion: Short-wavelength lasers improve resolution in metal 3D printing using nanoparticles.

Abstract: Microscale additive manufacturing of reflective copper is becoming increasingly important for microelectronics and microcomputers, due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. Yet, it remains challenging for state-of-the-art commercial metal 3D printers to achieve sub-100-micron manufacturing. Two aspects are sub-optimal using commercial laser powder bed fusion systems with infrared (IR) lasers (wavelength of 1060-1070 nm): (1) IR laser has a low absorption rate for Cu, which is energy-inefficient for manufacturing; (2) short wavelength lasers can potentially offer higher resolution processing due to the diffraction-limited processing. On the other hand, laser sintering or melting typically uses continuous wave (CW) lasers, which may reduce the manufacturing resolution due to a large heat-affected zone. Based on these facts, this study investigates the UV (wavelength of 355 nm) nanosecond (ns) laser sintering of Cu nanoparticles. Different laser processing parameters, as well as different nanoparticle packing densities, are studied. Our results show that a short-wavelength laser can reduce the required energy for sintering with decent morphology, and a densified nanoparticle powder bed favors continuous melting. We further show that sub-20 micron printing can be readily achieved with a UV ns laser. These findings provide new insights into short-wavelength laser-metal nanoparticle interactions, which may pave the way to achieve high-resolution micro and nano-scale additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schrödinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.

Motivation: To achieve precise 3D characterisation of plasmonic nanoparticles beyond the capabilities of electron microscopy.

Method: Used polarised light in optical microscopy, measured linear and radial polarisation, and fitted to an ellipsoid model including semi-axes and rotation angles.

Result: High-precision measurements (5% aspect ratio, 0.25 nm semi-axes), verified the Rayleigh-Gans model with corrections.

Conclusion: This method enhances 3D shape determination using simple microscopy, with applications in quality control and material science.

Abstract: Quantitative polarisation-resolved optical extinction microscopy of individual plasmonic nanoparticles has recently been introduced as a powerful tool to characterise the nanoparticle's morphology with a precision comparable to electron microscopy, while using a simple optical microscope [Nanoscale 12, 16215 (2020)]. Here we extend the technique by adding measurements for radial polarisation in the condenser back focal plane, probing plasmonic resonances polarised in axial direction. The combined linear and radial polarisation measurements provide a significantly enhanced precision of the retrieved 3D morphology, as we show on defect-free ultra-uniform gold nanospheres of 30 nm nominal diameter characterised by transmission electron microscopy. The measured cross-sections are quantitatively described by an ellipsoid model, determining the three semi-axes and rotation angles by fitting the measurements. Evaluation the distribution of the fit error across the set of measured particles, the material permittivity dataset and surface damping parameter g providing the best fit are found to be the single crystal dataset by Olmon et al. [Phys. Rev. B 86, 235147 (2012)] and g = 1.8, respectively. The precision of the retrieved aspect ratio is below 5%, and all three ellipsoidal semi-axes are determined with an impressive precision of 0.25 nm. Notably, corrections to the Rayleigh-Gans ellipsoid model due to retardation are significant even though the particle diameters are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the wavelength, and taking them into account improves the accuracy to below a nanometer.

Abstract: The engineering of specialty lasers with unconventional mode structures is one of the modern challenges in the development of integrated coherent sources. Examples include the use of bound states in the continuum, microlasers with orbital angular momentum, Dirac-band lasers and topological lasers. In this work we engineer a two-dimensional lattice of coupled micropillars with lasing line modes. We use a convenient combination of orbital photonic modes to design photonic bands which are flat in one direction and dispersive in the perpendicular one giving rise to line lasing modes. Such an architecture opens the possibility of implementing densely packed lasing matrices in compact two dimensional lattices.

Abstract: Optimal transport methods have recently established state of the art accuracy and efficiency for holographic laser beam shaping. However, use of such methods is hindered by severe $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ time requirements for large scale input or output images with $N$ total pixels. Here we leverage the dual formulation of the optimal transport problem and the separable structure of the cost to implement algorithms with greatly reduced $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory and $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N^{3/2})$ time complexity. These algorithms are parallelizable and can solve megapixel-scale beam shaping problems in tens of seconds on a CPU or seconds on a GPU.

Abstract: Phase-change material (PCM)-based non-volatile multilevel phase shifters are key components in photonic integrated circuits. Electrically, multiple phase levels can be encoded by controlling the heater power and employing different microheater architectures to induce varying degrees of PCM amorphization. However, encoding a large number of levels is not straightforward. In this work, we first investigate a phase shifter structure based on a GeSe PCM integrated on top of a silicon-on-insulator waveguide, employing a simple rectangular-shaped heater under pulse-width modulation (PWM). We numerically demonstrate that multilevel phase shifts can be achieved because of non-uniform heating in the GeSe PCM layer. However, the resulting phase levels for this basic configuration are highly non-linear because of the uniform power dissipation along the light propagation direction characterized by the same cross-section. To overcome this limitation, we designed a novel PCM-based phase shifter with a segmented heater whose width gradually increases along the light propagation direction. This configuration enables the encoding of hundreds of well-spaced phase levels between 0 and $π$, facilitated by smoother amorphization arising from the combined effects of non-uniform heating across segments and within each segment, while achieving an insertion loss of only 0.6 dB in the worst case. Furthermore, when evaluating both heater architectures under pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) at a fixed pulse duration, we observe behavior consistent with the trends observed for PWM, confirming the superior performance of the segmented heater design.

Abstract: We present a simulation guided design for a multilayer surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based biosensor capable of detecting refractive index changes in a target induced by analytes. Surface plasmons are excited using a hybrid Kretschmann configuration with a calcium fluoride (CaF2) prism under transverse magnetic polarization illumination. In the sensing architecture, copper (Cu) serves as the plasmonic metal and is overlaid with a thin nickel (Ni) layer to prevent oxidation. To enhance analyte coupling and electromagnetic field confinement, a dielectric layer of barium titanium oxide (BaTiO3) along with a monolayer of graphene oxide (GO) is incorporated. The multilayer structure is iteratively optimized using the transfer matrix method for angular interrogation at a wavelength of 1064 nm, focusing on key performance parameters such as sensitivity, minimum reflectivity, and figure of merit (FOM). Finite element method based simulations confirm efficient surface plasmon excitation, with optimal layer thicknesses of 30 nm for Cu and 5 nm for BaTiO3. The proposed SPR based sensor (CaF2 Cu Ni BaTiO3 GO) achieves a sensitivity of 157.8 deg per RIU and a figure of merit of 17.48 RIU minus one while detecting the presence of Escherichia coli bacteria in water, demonstrating its potential for waterborne pathogen sensing applications.

Conclusion: The GFIM-based phase-matching visualization is an effective strategy for designing compact, high-performance nonlinear photonic devices with excellent efficiency and phase coherence.

Abstract: Efficient nonlinear frequency conversion in nanophotonics requires not only strong fundamental field but also precise phase matching among distributed nonlinear sources. Here, we develop the two-dimensional Green's function integral method (GFIM), which enables direct visualization and optimization of phase matching in nonlinear guided-mode resonators. Using GFIM phase analysis, we generalize the phase-matching factor (PMF) as a rigorous metric of spatial phase coherence in harmonic generation, revealing severe phase mismatch in conventional guide mode resonators. Guided by phase-matching profiles, we propose design strategies to improve the phase coherence, particularly by introducing a high-index waveguide layer that confines the fundamental field in the nonlinear material to regions where the harmonic Green's function varies slowly. This configuration achieves a PMF exceeding 0.91, approaching the ideal value of unity, and yields a record SHG efficiency of 26.7% at a low pump intensity of 2 kW/$\mathrm{cm}^2$. These results establish the GFIM-based phase-matching visualization as an effective strategy for compact, high-performance nonlinear photonic devices.

Abstract: Harnessing structural correlations in near-field plasmonic and polaritonic systems hold untapped potential for controlling light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. By tuning these correlations, one can reshape mode localization, coupling, and spectral distribution which are properties central to manipulating energy transport and field enhancement in nanophotonic platforms. We exploit Vogel spirals, an aperiodic geometry where a single parameter dictates spatial correlations, to show how correlation strength reshapes the modal spectrum and transient dynamics of near-field coupling. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that aperiodic configurations outperform both uncorrelated (random) and periodic arrays in controlling near-field radiative heat-transfer dynamics. These results establish deterministic aperiodic order as a powerful platform for tailoring correlated electromagnetic responses in next-generation nanophotonic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the growing need for energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) applications, particularly the development of non-volatile photonic switches as a key enabler for scalable and low-energy photonic computing.

Method: The research employs photonic switches based on GST-467, comparing it with other phase-change materials (GeSb4Te3 GST, GSST, and GSS). The study uses a combination of experimental techniques, including complex refractive index measurements, three-dimensional FDTD simulations, and laser-induced thermo-optical simulations.

Result: The experiments reveal that GST-467 provides the largest transmission contrast and supports up to 48 resolvable optical states. FDTD simulations show that segmentation in the photonic switch enhances the extinction ratio and reduces insertion loss, improving the design's figure of merit. Additionally, the switch exhibits efficient, reversible switching with low energy requirements, achieving multi-level weights in photonic DNN architectures with superior classification accuracy.

Conclusion: The research establishes GST-467 as a highly promising phase-change material for scalable, low-energy photonic computing and neuromorphic hardware, outperforming traditional phase-change materials in both switching efficiency and photonic state storage capabilities.

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) have emerged as key enablers of non-volatile, ultra-compact photonic switches for energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) applications. In this work, we investigate the recently discovered $\mathrm{Ge_{4}Sb_{6}Te_{7}}$ (GST-467) as a high-contrast optical PCM and demonstrate its suitability for multi-level photonic computing. The complex refractive indices of amorphous and crystalline GST-467 were experimentally extracted and used to propose a segmented silicon-on-insulator photonic switch optimized at 1550 nm. Three-dimensional FDTD simulations reveal that segmentation significantly enhances the extinction ratio while maintaining low insertion loss, resulting in a more than seven times higher design figure of merit than an unsegmented design. Laser-induced thermo-optical simulations further establish efficient, reversible switching with sub-nJ energy requirements for crystallization and amorphization. Compared with established GST, GSST, and GSS compositions, GST-467 provides the largest transmission contrast and supports up to 48 resolvable optical states. When deployed as multi-level weights in photonic DNN architectures, the GST-467 switch achieves superior classification accuracy on EMNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. These results position GST-467 as a highly promising PCM for scalable, low-energy photonic computing and neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: We present a vision simulator device (Katsim), a compact near-eye optical display designed for assessing postoperative corrected vision, preoperative intraocular lens (IOL) assessment, and objective IOL characterization. The system forms a virtual image using an amplitude-modulated LCoS spatial light modulator (AM-SLM), RGB LED illumination, and a high-speed varifocal lens. In the proposed architecture, the LED illumination and varifocal lens diopter changes are triggered in synchrony with the SLM RGB subframes, rendering three depth planes perceptually simultaneously via high-frequency time-multiplexing. Operating at 60 frames per second (fps), the system achieves an effective 180 Hz depth-coded cycle, enabling sharp, multi-depth rendering within a dynamically adjustable depth range from 0.2 m to optical infinity. The system's eyebox is configurable from 1 to 5 mm, while maintaining a fixed spatial location and preserving angular magnification regardless of changes in focus or eyebox size. The designed system features a 9.15-degree field of view. An integrated infrared pupil-tracking module detects non-cataractous regions of the cataractous crystalline lens, and the projected imagery is mechanically steered through those clear zones in real time. The proposed vision simulator supports both subjective simulation of post-surgical vision for patient-specific counseling and objective optical evaluation of IOLs, including resolution and contrast fidelity (e.g., modulation transfer function, contrast transfer function, and defocus curves). By decoupling depth modulation from eyebox position and size, the system offers a modular, portable platform that supports enhanced preoperative planning, personalized IOL selection, objective IOL characterization, and use as a novel research vision tool.

Abstract: Thermal-radiation detectors such as bolometers -- often found as thin, suspended films -- are intrinsically limited by their optical absorption properties and by their intrinsic thermal conductive and radiative losses. We analyze the impact of the photon energy exchange between the film and a substrate located close to each other, noticing that the associated near-field exchange has been overlooked and could reduce the detectivity. In addition, we study how the nanometric thickness of the suspended film and its material impact the detectivity of such sensors. It is found that the blackbody-related photon noise limit of the detectivity can be surpassed with thin films. These results emphasize pathways for improvements of thermal-radiation detectors.

Abstract: The integration of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and second order nonlinearity in non-centrosymmetric photonic microresonators presents a highly promising solution for developing on-chip coherent light sources with exceptional bandwidth and flexible tunability. Our study introduces an innovative methodology leveraging cavity polygon modes within an X-cut thin-film lithium niobate microdisk to achieve highly efficient multi-chromatic Raman microlasers. Specifically, high-Q square modes characterized by two parallel sides oriented perpendicularly relative to the optical axis of lithium niobate crystal were excited. These modes offer distinct advantages, including enhancing both mode-field overlap and improved phase matching, achieved through the utilization of the largest second-order susceptibility component (d_33), which is critical for Raman-quadratic nonlinear interactions. The experimental results highlight significant advancements in multi-wavelength multi-wavelength laser generation, with forward stimulated Raman laser signals exhibiting a high conversion efficiency of up to 65.02% and an impressively narrow integral linewidth of only 5.2 kHz. Simultaneously, our system enables the generation of multi-wavelength Raman-quadratic laser signals across the ~800 nm and ~530 nm spectral bands. These findings are further underscored by an impressive absolute conversion efficiency of 1.33% for the 797.4-nm Raman laser, achieved at a remarkably low pump power of just 1.07 mW. This work not only extends the application scope of cavity polygon modes from single second/third-order nonlinear optical processes to cascaded processes but also establishes a foundation for realizing high-efficiency on-chip multi-chromatic laser sources with versatile functionalities.

Abstract: We introduce a novel light-matter interface that integrates a nanoscale buried heterostructure emitter into a dielectric bowtie cavity, co-localising the optical hotspot and the electronic wavefunction. This platform enables strong light-matter interaction through deep subwavelength confinement while remaining compatible with scalable fabrication. We show that in this regime an explicit treatment of the emitter's spatial extent is required, and that a confinement-factor approximation more accurately predicts the coupling, revealing design rules inaccessible to dipole-based metrics. For an InP/InGaAsP system, we predict coupling strengths of 0.4-0.7 meV for gap sizes of 50-10 nm, establishing the buried heterostructure-bowtie architecture as a practical route to deterministic strong coupling in solid-state nanophotonics.

Conclusion: 该研究为固体中的强场高调和光生成提供了一种可靠的方法，为光模式操控和高速光学通信奠定了基础。

Abstract: The ability to sculpt light in space, time, and polarization has revolutionized studies of light-matter interaction and enabled breakthroughs in optical communication, imaging, and ultrafast science. Among the many degrees of freedom of light, orbital angular momentum (OAM) further expands these capabilities by unlocking new regimes of control in information encoding, particle manipulation, and symmetry-driven selection rules. However, exploiting OAM to drive nonlinear, non-perturbative effects in solids remains challenging, especially in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regime, a key region for accessing these effects in ambient air, where spatial light modulators do not operate. Here, we circumvent this limitation by generating femtosecond, few-cycle MIR Bessel-Gauss vortex (BGV) and Perfect optical vortices (POVs), using a robust, static spatial-shaping strategy. Using those beams to drive the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in solids, we show that the resulting harmonic beams faithfully inherit the structural properties of the drivers: the constant-intensity ring of the POV is preserved across harmonic orders, while the harmonic BGVs retain their intrinsic TC-dependent profiles. Furthermore, by verifying the OAM up-scaling law, we confirm OAM conservation during HHG in solids. These results establish strong-field HHG in solids as a robust platform for synthesizing ultrafast structured harmonic light with controllable, high-value OAM.

Abstract: Confocal and multi-photon microscopy are widely used for in-vivo fluorescence imaging of biological tissues such as the brain, offering non-invasive access up to ~1 mm depth without major loss in performance. A recently-developed alternative is holographic endoscopy, which exploits controlled light transport through hair-thin optical fibres. With minimal invasiveness, it provides observations at comparable spatial resolution, while extending its applicability to unprecedented depths. It has been used to resolve details of sub-cellular structural connectivity, record neuronal signalling, and monitor blood flow from the deepest locations of the living brain. Yet, its use, particularly in densely labelled brain regions, has so far been constrained by significant contrast loss, primarily due to the absence of a practical mechanism for rejecting out-of-focus fluorescence light -- a capability inherently provided by confocal and multi-photon microscopy. Exploring opportunities in the structure of light modes of different MMF types we identify the possibility of achieving an analogue to confocal fluorescence microscopy through MMF-based endoscopes. Using a novel composite fibre probe that combines graded-index and step-index MMFs, we enable spatially resolved signal collection and selective rejection of out-of-focus light. This confocal filtering significantly enhances image contrast and resolution by suppressing background and off-plane signals. We demonstrate improved imaging performance on fine structural connectivity and intracellular calcium signalling in living mouse brain.

Conclusion: FF-STEM 提供了高对比度、定量精度高、效率高的 4D-STEM 成像方法，扩展了传统 STEM 的应用范围。

Abstract: Linear phase-contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) techniques compatible with high-throughput 4D-STEM acquisition are widely used to enhance phase contrast in weakly scattering and beam-sensitive materials. In these modalities, contrast transfer is often suppressed at low spatial frequencies, resulting in a characteristic contrast gap that limits quantitative imaging. Approaches that retain low-frequency phase contrast exist but typically require substantially increased experimental complexity, restricting routine use. Dark-field STEM imaging captures this missing low-frequency information through electrons scattered outside the bright-field disk, but discards a large fraction of the scattered signal and is therefore dose-inefficient. Fused Full-field STEM (FF-STEM) is introduced as a 4D-STEM imaging modality that overcomes this limitation by combining ptychographic phase reconstruction with tilt-corrected dark-field imaging within a single acquisition. Bright-field data are used to estimate probe aberrations and reconstruct a high-resolution phase image, while dark-field data provide complementary low-frequency contrast. The two channels are optimally fused in Fourier space using minimum-variance weighting based on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio, yielding transfer-gap-free images with high contrast and quantitative fidelity. FF-STEM preserves the upsampling and depth-sectioning capabilities of ptychography, adds robust low-frequency contrast characteristic of dark-field imaging, and enables dose-efficient, near-real-time reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of nonlinear light-matter interactions in a three-dimensional gold-polymer hybrid metasurface. In contrast to conventional two-dimensional designs, which by symmetry may support either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, our volumetric architecture accepts both TE and TM modes simultaneously, reflecting the dimensionality and versatility required by the photonic devices. The metasurface comprises a periodic lattice of gold nanostructures embedded in a dielectric polymer matrix, creating complex metal-dielectric interfaces that sustain tightly confined plasmonic resonances. When driven by ultrafast near-infrared pulses, these resonances concentrate optical energy at the nanoscale, enabling efficient third-harmonic generation and upconversion of visible light into the ultraviolet (UV) and deep-UV regimes with enhanced conversion efficiency. We perform spatial and temporal mapping of the nonlinear response under both TE and TM excitation. Our measurements reveal polarization-agnostic field enhancement and spectral tunability arising from the three-dimensional morphology-capabilities unattainable in planar metasurfaces, where two-dimensional symmetry inherently limits polarization flexibility and functional bandwidth. This 3D platform provides a flexible design toolbox for polarization-independent UV and deep-UV light sources. Potential applications include high-resolution UV spectroscopy, optical multiplexing, data storage, and emerging quantum photonic architectures. By establishing fundamental insights into three-dimensional nonlinear metasurface behavior, our work paves the way for next-generation reconfigurable, multi-polarization nanophotonic devices.

Conclusion: This work suggests that ACI and deep learning can synergize to address atmospheric turbulence, opening up new possibilities in related technologies.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence imposes a fundamental limitation across a broad range of applications, including optical imaging, remote sensing, and free-space optical communication. Recent advances in adaptive optics, wavefront shaping, and machine learning, driven by synergistic progress in fundamental theories, optoelectronic hardware, and computational algorithms, have demonstrated substantial potential in mitigating turbulence-induced distortions. Recently, active convolved illumination (ACI) was proposed as a versatile and physics-driven technique for transmitting structured light beams with minimal distortion through highly challenging turbulent regimes. While distinct in its formulation, ACI shares conceptual similarities with other physics-driven distortion correction approaches and stands to benefit from complementary integration with data-driven deep learning (DL) models. Inspired by recent work coupling deep learning with traditional turbulence mitigation strategies, the present work investigates the feasibility of integrating ACI with neural network-based methods. We outline a conceptual framework for coupling ACI with data-driven models and identify conditions under which learned representations can meaningfully support ACI's correlation-injection mechanism. As a representative example, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) together with a transfer-learning approach to examine how a learned model may operate in tandem with ACI. This exploratory study demonstrates feasible implementation pathways and establishes an early foundation for assessing the potential of future ACI-DL hybrid architectures, representing a step toward evaluating broader synergistic interactions between ACI and modern DL models.

Abstract: We study the formation of solitons in a uniform quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) spin-orbit (SO) coupled self-repulsive binary dipolar and nondipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation. For a weak SO coupling, in a nondipolar BEC, one can have three types of degenerate solitons: a multi-ring soliton with intrinsic vorticity of angular momentum projection $+1$ or $-1$ in one component and 0 in the other, a circularly-asymmetric soliton and a stripe soliton with stripes in the density. For an intermediate SO couplings, the multi-ring soliton ceases to exist and there appears a square-lattice soliton with a spatially-periodic pattern in density on a square lattice, in addition to the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons. In the presence of a dipolar interaction, with the polarization direction aligned in the quasi-2D plane, only the degenerate circularly-asymmetric and stripe solitons appear.

TL;DR: This paper explores the non-equilibrium dynamics in a two-component anyon-Hubbard model, discovering asymmetric transport and dynamical symmetries through numerical simulations and symmetry analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complex dynamics of anyons in Hubbard models is crucial for advancing quantum simulation and topological phases of matter in condensed matter physics.

Method: The authors performed numerical simulations of two-particle dynamics and symmetry analysis on an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder with synthetic gauge fields and density-dependent properties.

Result: The system exhibits asymmetric transport with broken inversion symmetry, alongside identified dynamical symmetries. The expansion dynamics are symmetric via spatial inversion and component flip, contingent on specific parameter adjustments. In the noninteracting scenario, dynamical suppression is observed due to exchange statistics and synthetic gauge flux. With interactions enabled, both chiral and antichiral dynamics emerge, adjustable via exchange phase and gauge flux modifications. The paper delineates phase regions that influence these chiral-antichiral behaviors.

Conclusion: The research uncovers rich dynamic phenomena resulting from the interplay of anyonic statistics, synthetic gauge fields, and interactions in multi-component anyon systems, paving the way for future explorations in topological quantum matter.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics in a one-dimensional two-component anyon-Hubbard model, which can be mapped to an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder with density-dependent hopping phase and synthetic gauge flux. Through numerical simulations of two-particle dynamics and the symmetry analysis, we reveal the asymmetric transport with broken inversion symmetry and two dynamical symmetries in the expansion dynamics. The expansion of two-component anyons is dynamically symmetric under spatial inversion and component flip, when the sign of anyonic statistics phase or the signs of gauge flux and interaction are changed. In the non-interacting case, we show the dynamical suppression induced by both the statistics phase and gauge flux. In the interacting case, we demonstrate that both chiral and antichiral dynamics can be exhibited and tuned by the statistics phase and gauge flux. The dynamical phase regimes with respect to the chiral-antichiral dynamics are obtained. These findings highlight the rich dynamical phenomena arising from the interplay of anyonic exchange statistics, synthetic gauge fields, and interactions in multi-component anyons.

Conclusion: This advancement offers new possibilities for enhancing the performance of data-driven tools in weather forecasting and fluid dynamics through improved modeling of chaotic systems.

Abstract: We propose an Entropy-Optimal Manifold Clustering (EOMC) - and show that it mitigates the cost scaling and robustness issues of the existing dimensionality reduction and manifold learning tools in nonstationary and nonlinear situations, while pertaining the favourable O(T) iteration complexity scaling in the statistics size T. Applying EOMC to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system (a very popular model of a simplified atmosphere dynamics)in chaotic and strongly-chaotic regimes reveals that its dynamics is essentially described by a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent three-dimensional attractive manifolds. The dimensionality of these manifolds appears to remain unchanged, and their overall number gradually grows with the growing external forcing of the Lorenz-96 model. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents for this system, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others). These findings open new exciting opportunities for EOMC and transfer operator theory, by improving predictive skills and performance of data-driven tools in fluid mechanics and geosciences applications.

Abstract: In this thesis, we review the theory of Lyapunov exponents and covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) and use these objects to numerically investigate the dynamics of several autonomous Hamiltonian systems. The algorithm which we use for computing CLVs is the one developed by Ginelli and collaborators (G&C), which is quite efficient and has been used previously in many numerical investigations. Using two low-dimensional Hamiltonian systems as toy models, we develop a method for measuring the convergence rates of vectors and subspaces computed via the G&C algorithm, and we use the time it takes for this convergence to occur to determine the appropriate transient time lengths needed when applying this algorithm to compute CLVs. The tangent dynamics of the centre subspace of the Hénon-Heiles system is investigated numerically through the use of CLVs, and we propose a method that improves the accuracy of the centre subspace computed with the G&C algorithm. As another application of the method of CLVs to the Hénon-Heiles system, we find that the splitting subspaces (which form a splitting of the tangent space and define the CLVs) become almost tangent during sticky regimes of motion, an observation which is related to the hyperbolicity of the system. Additionally, we investigate the dynamics of bubbles (i.e. thermal openings between base pairs) in homogeneous DNA sequences using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois lattice model of DNA. For the purpose of studying short-lived bubbles in DNA, the notions of instantaneous Lyapunov vectors (ILVs) are introduced in the context of Hamiltonian dynamics. While we find that the size of the opening between base pairs has no clear relationship with the spatial distribution of the first CLV at that site, we do observe a distinct relationship with various ILV distributions.

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the well-known perturbed Duffing system and investigate its chaotic dynamics by means of numerical Runge--Kutta method based on topological horseshoe theory. Precisely, we investigate chaos through the topological horseshoes associated with the first, second, and third return maps, obtained by varying the amplitude of an external force term while keeping all other parameters fixed. Our new finding demonstrates that, when the force amplitude exceeds a certain value, the topological (Smale) horseshoe degenerates into a pseudo-horseshoe, while chaotic invariant set persists. This phenomenon indicates that the lower bound of the topological entropy decreases as the force amplitude increases, thereby enriching the dynamics in the perturbed Duffing system.
  Furthermore, we identify a critical value of the force amplitude governing the attractivity of the chaotic invariant set. For amplitudes slightly below this value, the basin of attraction of the chaotic invariant set progressively shrinks as the amplitude increases. In contrast, for larger amplitudes, both Lyapunov exponents become negative while the topological horseshoe persists, suggesting that the chaotic invariant set loses attractivity as the amplitude grows.

### [45] [Lineshape-asymmetry-caused shift in atomic interferometers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18476)

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the shift in atomic interferometers caused by asymmetry in laser spectroscopic lineshapes. This effect arises due to both free evolution and Ramsey pulses having frequency-chirped lasers, leading to a shift proportional to 1/T^3, which is more significant for compact interferometers with shorter baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the overlooked factor of frequency-chirped lasers in both free evolution and Ramsey pulses, leading to a shift in atomic interferometers. The authors highlight that this effect was previously unaccounted for in standard atomic interferometry, and their discovery of the lineshape asymmetry caused by this chirping introduces a new parameter to consider. This finding is significant because it enhances the metrological capabilities of atomic interferometers, particularly those with compact designs, by improving precision in gravitational measurements and sensing.

Method: The authors model the effect of frequency-chirped lasers on both free evolution intervals and Ramsey pulses. They derive a theoretical expression for the shift caused by the lineshape asymmetry, showing that it scales inversely with the cube of the interval time (1/T^3). They compare their theoretical predictions with experimental data, demonstrating the practical relevance of their findings. The paper also provides numerical estimates for specific interferometers, such as those using rubidium atoms, to illustrate the metrological implications.

Result: The study reveals that the shift due to lineshape asymmetry (LACS) scales as 1/T^3, differing from the traditional 1/T^2 dependence in atomic interferometry. This results in a substantial increase in the metrological importance for compact interferometers. For example, at T ≈ 1 ms, the LACS shift is estimated to be at the level of 0.1-1 mGal, while for T ≈ 100 μs, it can reach 0.1-1 Gal. These findings offer new insights into improving the sensitivity of atomic gravimeters and sensors.

Conclusion: This research highlights the underappreciated role of frequency-chirped lasers in atomic interferometry and provides a comprehensive understanding of the shift caused by their asymmetry. The theoretical framework and numerical results presented have significant implications for the design and application of compact atomic interferometers, particularly in gravitational measurements and sensing.

Abstract: We investigate the shift caused by asymmetry of spectroscopic lineshape in atomic interferometers, which has not previously been discussed in the scientific literature. This asymmetry arises because laser field is frequency-chirped not only during the free-evolution intervals of atoms, but also during the Ramsey pulses. As a result, the effective detuning from the working atomic transition during the pulses also depends on the chirping rate, which, in turn, leads to the lineshape-asymmetry-caused shift (LACS). It is shown that this shift has an inverse cubic dependence of $\propto 1/T^3$ on the duration of the interval between the Ramsey pulses $T$, which markedly contrasts with the $\propto 1/T^2$ dependence typical in atomic interferometry. Therefore, the metrological importance of this shift substantially increases for compact atomic interferometers with a short baseline. For example, for interferometers-gravimeters using two-photon transitions in rubidium atoms, at $T\sim 1$~ms we estimate the LACS shift and its variations at the level of 0.1-1~mGal, while for $T\sim 100$~$μ$s this can reach a value of 0.1-1~Gal.

These alternative approaches broaden the scope of applications for real-time inertial phase compensation methods in atomic interferometers, particularly for space applications.

Abstract: Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) relaxometry holds promising future for advancement of high spatiotemporal resolution metabolic imaging technology. In this study, we demonstrate a simultaneous integration of spatial position tracking with FND relaxometry to characterize the temporal dynamics of metabolic processes, thereby enhancing the capability to monitor cellular activities over time. To enable targeted metabolic probing in living cells, FNDs were surface-functionalized to achieve specific localization within key organelles, including the nucleus and mitochondria. This strategy not only facilitates subcellular-level metabolic monitoring but also allows for direct comparison between intra- and extranuclear microenvironments within the same living cell, offering substantial potential for elucidating the spatial and functional heterogeneity of cellular metabolism.

Conclusion: 利用数字全息显微镜研究细菌在有缝流动中的迁移行为，为理解微生物的迁移机制和设计相关系统提供了新的观察工具和数据。

Abstract: Prior to pioneer surface adhesion, bacteria have to navigate in flows, often in confined environments. While much is known about their individual swimming dynamics, our understanding of their transport properties at the population level remains limited. This is primarily due to the experimental challenges associated with tracking, in three dimensions and under flow, a large sample of these microorganisms. Here we investigate, through fast digital holographic microscopy (DHM), a suspension of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 bacteria in a confined Poiseuille flow. Based on the analysis of several thousand Lagrangian trajectories, we first demonstrate the ability of DHM to discriminate between the fraction of bacteria that adhere to walls, those that are only convected by the flow, and those for which motility helps them migrate through the channel and cross streamlines. Focusing on the motile part of the population, we report new experimental results concerning the spatial and orientational distributions across the confinement direction. In the central part of the flow, migration and shear trapping are observed and well described by existing kinetic models. Close to the walls, averaging over the entire motile population clearly shows an accumulation layer but with no net orientational order, which contradicts models that neglect hydrodynamic interactions with solid surfaces. We think that DHM coupled with the analysis of large-scale bacterial populations will help to understand their transfer mechanisms from the bulk to surfaces.

Abstract: Life is commonly described as a self-organized, far-from-equilibrium process that maintains internal order by consuming free energy and exporting entropy. This thermodynamic view underlies diverse theoretical frameworks -- from autopoiesis and relational biology to autocatalytic sets and hypercycles -- yet dissipation is typically treated as a necessary consequence of living organization rather than as a property shaped by its internal dynamics. Here, through explicit calculations of biotic chemical reactions and empirical documentation, we show that living systems universally function as non-normal chemical accelerators. Their elevated entropy production emerges from the asymmetric and hierarchical architecture of their biochemical networks. We introduce a general conceptual and mathematical framework in which biological structuration is understood as a dynamical property. Characterized by asymmetric couplings and transient amplification despite asymptotic stability, non-normal dynamics are shown to naturally generate kinetic acceleration, enhanced energy throughput, and phase-transition-like reorganizations without classical bifurcations. In this view, biological organization is not merely compatible with dissipation but actively structured to amplify free-energy flux and entropy export. We support this perspective with empirical and theoretical evidence that biochemical networks generically give rise to intrinsically non-normal operators through non-reciprocal interactions and hierarchical design. This framework yields testable predictions for dissipation rates, robustness, and evolutionary design principles, and suggests a kinetic principle of evolution in which living systems preferentially construct increasingly non-normal reaction architectures, driving sustained amplification of chemical fluxes and entropy flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of musculoskeletal systems is essential for biomechanics, rehabilitation, and assistive tech, but current models often overlook the diversity in mechanical demand across similar tasks.

Method: Surface EMG and joint kinematics were collected from 11 participants under 0, 2, and 4 kg loads. Three calibration strategies and three optimization frameworks were tested: load-specific vs. global vs. cross-load, and simulated annealing, particle swarm optimization, and hybrid PSO-PS.

Result: Load-specific calibration significantly outperformed other strategies, achieving lower RMSE and higher correlation (r > 0.75). Parameters showed high sensitivity to load, and PSO-based methods provided more reliable and biologically realistic estimates.

Conclusion: This framework enhances MSK model accuracy, enabling better differentiation between similar yet distinct tasks, which is vital for clinical applications and personalized assistive technologies.

Abstract: Accurate EMG-driven musculoskeletal (MSK) modeling is critical for biomechanics, rehabilitation, and assistive technology. However, most models calibrate parameters under a single load, ignoring the fact that tasks with similar kinematics may differ in mechanical demand. This study introduces a load-aware calibration framework to improve joint torque prediction accuracy and generalizability. Surface EMG and joint kinematics were recorded from eleven participants during elbow flexion-extension under 0, 2, and 4\,kg loads. We evaluated three calibration strategies (load-specific, global, cross-load) and three optimization frameworks (simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and hybrid PSO-pattern search (PSO-PS)). Results indicate that load-specific calibration significantly improves performance, with lower RMSE and higher correlation ($r > 0.75$). Parameters related to muscle force, fiber length, and activation dynamics showed high load sensitivity. PSO-based methods yielded more consistent and physiologically plausible estimates than simulated annealing. The proposed framework enables MSK models to distinguish between visually similar but mechanically distinct tasks, supporting robust subject-specific modeling for clinical and real-world applications.

Abstract: Recent work has shown an increasing interest in understanding the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and how ribosomes are displayed on it. Here we present a model that explains a physical reason for why the cell creates different structures of the ER. Due to the diffusion of biomolecules, we find that flat sheets and a matrix of tubules have different regimes of optimized capture efficiency. We extend the model to explain the observed difference in density of ribosomes on the structures of the ER. Due to the capture efficiency of tubules, less ribosomes are needed on those structures. For flat sheets, more ribosome coverage at biological separation distance is needed to match the same fraction of relative flux. We then push the model to predict that depending on the future life of the translated protein and overall demand for protein expression, the cell will utilize one structure of the ER over another. Predictions are compared with experimental data.

Abstract: Analysis of space-charge effects on electron emission typically makes some assumption of continuity and smoothness, whether this is continuity of charge as in the classical derivation of the Child-Langmuir current, or the mean-field approximation used in particle-in-cell simulations. However, when studying the physics of electron emission and propagation at the mesoscale it becomes necessary to consider the discrete nature of electronic charge to account for the space-charge effect of each individual point charge. In this paper we give an extensive analysis of some previous work on the distribution of electrons under space-charge limited conditions. We examine the spacing of electrons as they are emitted from a planar surface, We present simplified models for analysis of such conditions to derive scaling laws for emission and compare them to computer simulations.

Abstract: This work presents a complete methodology for the precise characterization of the acoustic field inside crystal-based devices driven by high-frequency ultrasounds towards the generation of tunable narrowband and directional gamma radiation via undulation of ultra-relativistic charged particles. Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.

Abstract: We present the baseline design of the electron ring collimation system for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The system addresses beam losses in a high-current electron storage ring with superconducting (SC) final-focus magnets and sensitive detectors, where uncontrolled losses can generate heat loads, radiation, and detector backgrounds and damage. The proposed collimation insertion localizes halo particle losses through reducing interaction region beam losses from beam-gas and Touschek scattering by several orders of magnitude while keeping detector backgrounds and cryostat heat loads within acceptable limits. Multi-turn particle tracking simulations show that the collimators do not significantly impact machine acceptance or beam lifetime, and their positions and apertures can be re-optimized for future lattice configurations. Ongoing work includes incorporating crab cavities and solenoid fields into simulations, refining vacuum conditions, and optimizing collimator geometry and materials. This design establishes a robust baseline for the EIC electron ring collimation system and supports continued lattice optimization for machine operations.

*Jaume Alonso,Yuri B. Suris*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: This paper discusses the geometric construction of commuting maps for discrete Painlevé equations, which are integrable birational maps on generalized Halphen surfaces. The surfaces can be seen as blow-ups of either $	extbf{P}^2$ at nine points or $	extbf{P}^1 	imes 	extbf{P}^1$ at eight points. In the autonomous case, these surfaces become rational elliptic surfaces when the blow-up points support specific pencils of curves. The symmetry group of the discrete Painlevé equations is the Weyl group $W(E_8^{(1)})$. The commuting maps correspond to translations by roots of the $E_8^{(1)}$ lattice. The paper presents a geometric construction using novel birational involutions based on these pencils of curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the desire to understand the symmetries and geometric structure of discrete Painlevé equations, this paper explores their construction via commuting maps and birational involutions. The birational geometry of Halphen surfaces provides a natural framework for these transformations, and the paper contributes to deepening our understanding of their geometric and algebraic properties.

Method: The paper constructs commuting birational maps for discrete Painlevé equations by introducing novel involutions based on pencils of curves. These involutions are used to generate transformations that commute due to the properties of the underlying Halphen surfaces and their elliptic structures. The authors leverage the geometry of blow-ups and involutions to associate the transformations with elements of the Weyl group $W(E_8^{(1)})$.

Result: The key result is the construction of a system of commuting birational maps corresponding to the Weyl group transformations of $W(E_8^{(1)})$. This is achieved through birational involutions based on pencils of cubic and biquadratic curves, which provide the necessary geometric structure to generate commuting automorphisms. The commuting nature of these maps is demonstrated through their geometric construction and the properties of the Halphen surfaces.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this paper successfully constructs commuting birational maps for discrete Painlevé equations by utilizing the geometry of generalized Halphen surfaces and novel birational involutions. This construction is grounded in the properties of blow-ups, pencils of curves, and the elliptic fibration structure, providing a deep connection between the algebraic symmetries (Weyl group) and the geometric transformations.

Abstract: Discrete Painlevé equations are integrable two-dimensional birational maps associated to a family of generalized Halphen surfaces. The latter can be seen either as $\mathbb P^2$ blown up at nine points or as $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$ blown up at eight points. These maps become autonomous if the blow-up points are in a special position (support a pencil of cubic curves in $\mathbb P^2$, respectively a pencil of biquadratic curves in $\mathbb P^1\times\mathbb P^1$), so that the generalized Halphen surfaces become rational elliptic surfaces. In the generic case, the symmetry of a discrete Painlevé equation is the Weyl group $W(E_8^{(1)})$. One has a system of commuting maps which correspond to translational elements of $W(E_8^{(1)})$ associated to the roots of the lattice $E_8^{(1)}$. In the present note, we give a geometric construction of these commuting maps. For this, we use some novel birational involutions based on the above mentioned pencils of curves.

Abstract: We introduce a curvature atlas for left-invariant metrics on SU(2), based on the inertial curvature field derived from the Euler-Poincare equations. We prove that the classical integrable cases of the heavy top--spherical, Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, and Goryachev-Chaplygin--correspond precisely to degenerate curvature signatures of this field, namely isotropic, orthogonally split, and symmetric-pair signatures. This yields a geometric necessary and sufficient condition for Liouville integrability: the geodesic flow (and the heavy top with axis-symmetric potential) is integrable if and only if the curvature signature is degenerate. Beyond the classical list, the atlas reveals a balanced-mixed regime (inertia ratio 2:2:1) that, while non-integrable, admits an exact curvature-balance relation and a family of pure-precession solutions. We formulate a curvature deviation functional quantifying the distance to integrability, describe near-integrable dynamics near the 2:2:1 regime, and present a complete integrability map in the plane of inertia ratios. The work provides a unified geometric framework for classifying, perturbing, and controlling rigid-body systems.

### [60] [Non-Abelian topological superconductivity from melting Abelian fractional Chern insulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17996)
*Zhengyan Darius Shi,T. Senthil*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Fractional Chern insulators are studied; increasing bandwidth drives FCI to a charge-2e superconductor. We propose a framework connecting superconductivity and fractionalization. Results show various superconductors including those with Majorana modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the relationship between material parameters and exotic phases like superconductors in FCI systems.

Method: Field-theoretic description, duality analysis in lattice models.

Result: Bandwidth tuning affects FCI transitions, leading to multiple superconducting states, including intrinsic non-Abelian ones supporting Majorana zeros.

Conclusion: Broad approach reveals rich possibilities for exotic superconductors tied to fractional Chern insulators at various fillings.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) are exotic phases of matter realized at partial filling of a Chern band that host fractionally charged anyon excitations. Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $ν= 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $ν= p/(2p+1)$.

TL;DR: This paper reports the observation of electronic phonons in Moiré superlattices through light scattering measurements, showing their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal and their tunability under external fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a new platform for studying strongly correlated systems and their collective excitations, offering an avenue for advancing both theoretical and experimental research in condensed matter physics.

Method: Light scattering measurements were used to directly observe electronic phonons in Mott insulating and stripe phases of WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattices. The method involved analyzing phonon energies, temperature dependencies, and polarization characteristics.

Result: The observed phonons emerge from electron correlations in correlated electron crystals. Their properties, such as energy, intensity, and polarization, are strongly tunable by external electric or magnetic fields, providing direct evidence of correlated lattice dynamics and electronic crystalline nature.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for studying and controlling collective excitations in correlated systems, offering a straightforward method to probe hydrated properties of materials at the collective level and potentially guiding the development of new synthetic strategies for moiré superlattices

Abstract: Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moiré systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: We construct a two-dimensional bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) paramagnet protected by an on-site $G=\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry, starting from a three-component $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet on a triangular lattice. Within the group-cohomology framework, $H^{3}(G,U(1))\cong \mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 7}$, we focus on a "colorless" cocycle representative obtained by antisymmetrizing the basic $\mathbb{Z}_4$ three-cocycle, and generate the corresponding SPT Hamiltonian via a cocycle-induced nonlocal unitary transformation followed by symmetry averaging. For open geometry, we derive the boundary theory explicitly: one color sector decouples, while the nontrivial edge reduces to an interacting $\mathbb{Z}_4$ chain with next-to-nearest-neighbor constraints that admits a compact dressed-Potts form. Using DMRG we show that the boundary model is gapless, with the lowest gap scaling as $1/L$ and an entanglement-entropy scaling consistent with a conformal field theory of central charge $c=2.191(4)\simeq 11/5$. The rational value $c=11/5$ matches the coset $SU(3)_3/SU(2)_3$, making it a candidate for the continuum description of the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ edge; we outline spectral and symmetry-resolved diagnostics needed to test this identification at the level of conformal towers beyond the central charge.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the lattice dynamics and CDW transitions in ErTe3 with Pd intercalation using X-ray diffraction and inelastic X-ray scattering. Structural analysis indicates that the a-CDW state is suppressed for intercalation levels x >= 0.02, but near there, phonon softening remains in evidence, possibly linked to a CDW Bragg glass state in higher intercalation levels.Phonon softening at specific q-vectors and its correlation with diffuse scattering highlight the competition between CDW ordering tendencies along the lattice axes, while the suppression of the a-CDW state for x >= 0.02 is conclusively demonstrated. The findings suggest that intercalation affects the CDW transitions through changes in lattice dynamics and phonon modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of intercalation on magnetic and structural properties of transition metal-doped telling compounds is a significant area of materials science, particularly in exploring novel quantum phases and potential applications in electronics or spintronics.

Method: This research employs x-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray scattering, and lattice dynamics modeling to examine the structural and dynamic changes in ErTe3 and its intercalated variants with Pd atoms. The method combines experimental data with computational modeling to analyze the competition between different CDW ordering tendencies and the suppression of the a-CDW state with increasing Pd intercalation levels.

Result: The study reveals that the a-CDW state is suppressed for x >= 0.02 in ErTe3-Pd, but the underlying mechanism involves incomplete phonon softening that might be linked to the recently proposed CDW Bragg glass state in highly intercalated samples. Diffuse scattering at specific q-vectors indicates partial phonon softening near a-CDW ordering temperature, suggesting a subtle interplay between lattice distortions and magnetic ordering.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights into how the intercalation of Pd in ErTe3 influences its lattice dynamics and CDW transitions, clarifying the mechanisms underlying the suppression of the a-CDW state and linking partial phonon softening to a conjectured CDW Bragg glass state at higher intercalation levels. This work contributes to the broader understanding of phase transitions in transition metal-doped telltale compounds.

Abstract: We investigated the lattice dynamics of quasi-two-dimensional Pd-intercalated $\mathrm{ErTe}_3$ in relation to its charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions by means of x-ray diffuse and meV-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. In pristine $\mathrm{ErTe}_3$, CDW order develops at orthogonal in-plane wave vectors $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{c} = (0, 0, 0.29)$ (the $c\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$) and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{2}^{a} = (0.31, 0, 0)$ (the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$), with transition temperatures $T_{1}^{c} = 270$~K and $T_{2}^{a} = 160$~K, respectively. Remarkably, we observe diffuse x-ray scattering already near the higher transition temperature $T_{1}^{c}$ along $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ but at a slightly different wave vector $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a} = (0.29, 0, 0)$. Inelastic x-ray scattering for $\mathrm{Pd}_{0.01}\mathrm{ErTe}_3$ shows that a partial phonon softening at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$, underscoring the strong competition between ordering tendencies along the nearly equivalent in-plane axes of the orthorhombic lattice. For intercalation levels $x \geq 0.02$, the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ state is suppressed. Nevertheless, a similar correlation between phonon softening and diffuse scattering persists along the $[100]$ direction, again observed at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a} = (0.29, 0, 0)$ and $T_{1}^{c}$. These findings confirm that the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ is fully suppressed for $x \geq 0.02$, and that the residual diffuse scattering at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$ originates from the partial phonon softening associated with the $c\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$, reflected by the near equality of the absolute size of $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{c}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$. In highly intercalated $\mathrm{Pd}_{0.023}\mathrm{ErTe}_3$, the phonon softening remains incomplete, possibly linked to the recently reported CDW Bragg glass state.

Conclusion: 该插值方法展示了强大的适用性和广泛适用性，尤其是在不同耦合参数下的表现。

Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Padé expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $φ^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $φ^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.

Abstract: The classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is important for understanding frustrated magnetic phenomena in materials such as $FePS_3$ and $Ba_2CoTeO_6$, where diverse phases (e.g., striped, zigzag, armchair) and magnetization plateaus have been experimentally observed. To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and Schottky-like anomalies.

Abstract: In many ways the solution to the Hedin equations represents an exact solution to the many body problem. However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host exotic fractionalized magnetic and gauge-field excitations whose microscopic origins and experimental verification remain frustratingly elusive. In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials.

Abstract: We report the results of high-resolution dc magnetization and specific-heat measurements at very low temperatures for
  a single crystal \color{black} of UBe$_{13}$ in magnetic fields applied along the [001] and [111] directions, in both the normal and superconducting states. In the normal state, magnetic susceptibility $χ(T) = M/H$ exhibits a logarithmic temperature dependence over a wide temperature range (1-20 K). However, with increasing field, this non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior of $χ(T) $ at low temperatures is suppressed. Moreover, a susceptibility maximum occurs below 4 T, whereas Fermi-liquid coherence is recovered above 8 T. In addition, thermodynamic anomalies ($T_{\rm A}$ and $H_{\rm A}$) occur in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at intermediate fields (6--10 T) along the [111] direction. Furthermore, a nontrivial fifth-order nonlinear susceptibility is observed in the normal-state magnetization of UBe$_{13}$. These results suggest a close relationship between the field-induced multipolar correlations of $5f$-electron degrees of freedom and the Fermi-surface reconstruction accompanying the crossover from the NFL state to the Fermi-liquid state in UBe$_{13}$.

Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of elementary magnon excitations of the ordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, series expansions (SE), and continuous similarity transformations (CST). The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the "roton minimum" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.

Abstract: The possibility of a zero temperature, altermagnetic instability in anisotropic two dimensional electron systems in the diffusive regime is analyzed, in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling. Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization.

Abstract: Measurement of the Hall effect is a ubiquitous probe for materials discovery, characterization, and metrology. Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor.

Abstract: In planar chiral magnets, the competition of the positive definite Heisenberg exchange and Zeeman energies with the indefinite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) energy allows for the possibility of negative energy ground states, and leads to an intricate dependence of the ground states on the parameters of the theory. In this paper, we consider arbitrary spiralization tensors for the DMI interaction and arbitrary directions for the external magnetic field, and study the nature of the ground states in this parameter space, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Classifying ground states by their symmetry into ferromagnetic (invariant under under arbitrary translations in the plane), spiral (invariant under arbitrary translations in one direction) and skyrmion lattice ground states (invariant under a two dimensional lattice group), we give a complete description of the phase diagram of this class of theories.

Conclusion: conclusion - acts as real candidates for kitaev magnetism; highlights value of magnetic diffuse scatt data for identifying such materials

Abstract: Uranium dioxide, UO$_2$, is a canonical example of a magnetic material with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we present a study of the magnetic diffuse scattering measured on a polycrystalline sample of UO$_2$, which we interpret in terms of its magnetic interactions between U$^{4+}$ magnetic moments. By refining values of the magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse-scattering data measured above the magnetic ordering transition temperature, we show that the dominant magnetic coupling in UO$_2$ is a bond-dependent interaction analogous to the Kitaev model of honeycomb magnets. We compare our experimental results with published theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Our results suggest that magnetic materials with $f$-electron magnetic ions, particularly actinides, may be promising candidates for realising Kitaev magnetism, and highlight the role that magnetic diffuse-scattering data can play in identifying such materials.

Abstract: We show that the nonlinear optical response probed by two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can discriminate between excitonic and lattice driven order. In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.

Abstract: Achieving both high internal efficiency and fast reset times at elevated temperatures remains challenging due to limited understanding of how film properties govern SNSPD performance. We demonstrate that epitaxial NbN films on sapphire enable simultaneous high efficiency and rapid response. We fabricate and characterize SNSPDs based on these films deposited via DC magnetron sputtering on c-cut sapphire. High-quality epitaxial growth preserves a low electron diffusion coefficient and promotes strong electron-phonon coupling, yielding a high critical temperature and efficient hotspot formation in the dirty limit. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirm epitaxial alignment and lattice order. Nanowires of 20 nm width exhibit saturated internal efficiency at 1550 nm wavelength and short reset times at 4.2 K, enabled by lattice matching and high thermal conductance of the sapphire interface. Ab initio modeling reproduces photon count rates, linking device performance quantitatively to film properties such as diffusivity and electron-phonon coupling.

TL;DR: A new method for improving AFM positioning accuracy using software-based feedforward control is developed, achieving significant enhancement without additional hardware.

Motivation: AFM is a critical tool for nanoscale characterization, and improving its accuracy is important for many applications. The current limitations of piezo scanners pose significant challenges, as they affect the overall performance and reliability of AFM systems.

Method: The method involves developing a software-based feedforward control system that generates scan waveforms to compensate for positioning errors. This approach simplifies implementation and calibration, making it suitable for routine use.

Result: The proposed method successfully reduces positioning errors in AFM systems, demonstrating up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. This advancement allows for more precise measurements in various applications, enhancing the effectiveness of AFM in diverse fields.

Conclusion: By addressing the limitations of piezo scanners through software-based feedforward control, this work presents a practical and effective solution for improving AFM positioning accuracy, which is essential for advancing nanoscale characterization across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables nanoscale characterization and has been widely applied across diverse systems. In AFM, the tip or sample is typically scanned using piezoelectric scanners, which convert applied voltages into precise mechanical displacements with sub-nanometer accuracy and high bandwidth. However, because piezo elements exhibit nonlinear responses, actual displacements can deviate from the applied driving signal by up to 20-30%. Various methods have been developed to improve positional accuracy, but they often suffer from limited scan speed, increased noise, or complex calibration procedures. From the perspective of routine maintenance, ease of calibration is more advantageous for applications where an error of around 1-2% is acceptable, especially when measuring dynamic molecular motions. Motivated by this, we developed a simple method to generate scan waveforms via software-based feedforward control, which can be easily implemented and calibrated. We identify four distinct sources of positioning error in piezo scanners and demonstrate that these errors can be compensated, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in positioning accuracy compared with uncompensated operation. Because the proposed method requires no additional hardware and is entirely software-based, it does not deteriorate imaging speed and is compatible with a wide range of AFM systems as well as other scanning probe microscopies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanical properties of cells is crucial for various fields, including physiology, pathology, and drug testing. Traditional methods often require contact with the cell or involve complex modeling, limiting their use in real-time applications.

Method: The study utilizes micro-elastography with microbubbles as localized shear wave sources. Acoustic oscillations generate shear waves, detected by a high-speed camera and microscope to measure wave velocities, enabling both average and local measurements.

Result: The method successfully measures shear waves in cells as small as 20~30 μm, achieving higher resolution than previous work. It demonstrates robustness, reproducibility, and applicability to real-time monitoring.

Conclusion: This advancement opens new possibilities for label-free, real-time mechanical monitoring of cells, enhancing applications across biological research and diagnostics.

Abstract: The mechanical properties of cells play key roles in their physiology, function, physiological and pathological transformations. Micro-elastography has recently emerged as a promising tool to estimate cellular viscoelastic properties within a millisecond, without the need for mechanical modeling. Here, we report a fully contactless approach to single-cell micro-elastography, using acoustically oscillating gas microbubbles positioned near individual cells (20~\textmu m diameter megakaryocytes) as localized shear wave sources. Using this approach, we successfully performed micro-elastography on cells up to five times smaller than those studied in previous works, establishing the smallest single-cell elastography measurements to date. Spherical or non-spherical bubble oscillations generated 15~kHz elastic waves, which we detected using a high-speed camera coupled to a standard bright-field microscope. Noise correlation elastography enabled the measurement of average and local shear-wave velocities within single cells. Our results demonstrate that this method is robust and reproducible across multiple cells from the same cell line, paving the way for real-time, label-free mechanical monitoring of single cells during fast biological processes.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the performance of an injection-locked 5.8-GHz continuous-wave magnetron with various load reflection levels. The load reflection is introduced to an equivalent magnetron model to theoretically evaluate the system performance. The effects of different load reflection levels on the magnetron's output are numerically analyzed. Experiments are performed while the load reflection is varied using an E-H tuner between a magnetron and a circulator. A narrower locking bandwidth is observed under constant injection power with increasing load reflection. The proper-mismatched system suppresses its sideband energy, thereby reducing phase noise. The experimental features qualitatively validate the theoretical analyses results. The investigation results also provide guidance for advanced applications in communication and high-energy physics based on injection-locked magnetrons.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A new physics-based model for understanding the biomechanics of tennis serves shows that the physical movements behind different serves (flat, slice, kick) result from complex gravitational and dynamic forces that rely on the active participation of joints, particularly in the wrist, to maintain stability and power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining why elite tennis players perform certain serve motions from a mechanistic perspective.

Method: Developed a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the upper body using inverse kinematics and dynamics analysis.

Result: Joints with minimal angular displacement, especially the wrist, require significant, time-varying torques to counteract gravity and coupling effects.

Conclusion: Provides a framework that emphasizes the active role of joints beyond mere imitation of elite techniques, highlighting the importance of joint compensation and active torque in serving mechanics.

Abstract: Most conventional studies on tennis serve biomechanics rely on phenomenological observations comparing professional and amateur players or, more recently, on AI-driven statistical analyses of motion data. While effective at describing \textit{what} elite players do, these approaches often fail to explain \textit{why} such motions are physically necessary from a mechanistic perspective. This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects. By elucidating the dissociation between visible kinematics and internal kinetics, this study provides a first-principles framework for understanding the mechanics of the tennis serve, moving beyond simple imitation of elite techniques.

*Bruno H. S. Mendonça,Elizane E. de Moraes,Hélio Chacham*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of nanotube bundle surface confinement on water nanochannels through molecular dynamics simulations. The study reveals that nanoconfinement reduces the dimensionality of water channels from 2D to 1D, with the self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D channels being highly sensitive to surface interactions and nanotube size. Smaller nanotubes (5 nm) exhibit higher self-diffusion coefficients compared to larger ones (10 nm), particularly for hydrophobic surfaces. Additionally, interstitial voids in the bundle material also support 1D water nanochannels with similar characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of nanoconfinement in shaping water nanochannels is essential for applications ranging from energy storage to biological systems, such as drug delivery and molecular recognition.

Method: Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to study the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of water nanochannels in confined spaces. The simulations started with completely filled void spaces and gradually increased inter-surface separation while maintaining water content, analyzing the resulting changes in water structure and diffusion.

Result: The simulation results indicate that as the inter-surface separation increases, the dimensionality of water channels decreases from 2D to 1D. The self-diffusion coefficients of 1D water nanochannels are significantly influenced by water-surface interactions and the nanotube diameter. Reducing the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm increases self-diffusion coefficients by a factor of 10 for hydrophilic surfaces and 6 for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing bulk water values. Additionally, the interstitial voids within the bulk bundle material also support methane channels with similar characteristics.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that through precise control of nanotube bundle surface properties and size, the confinement of water nanochannels can be tailored for specific applications, such as enhancing transport properties in nanofibers or bio-inspired materials.

Abstract: Water nanoconfinement is known to occur inside material void spaces, such as 2D confinement between surfaces, 1D confinement inside nanotubes, and variable-dimension confinement inside nanoporous materials. In the present work we investigate, through molecular dynamics simulations, the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficient of water channels that are nanoconfined in the void space between adjacent surfaces of nanotube bundles - an existing class of materials. In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes. Interestingly, as we decrease the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm, the self-diffusion coefficients of the 1D channels increase by tenfold for hydrophilic surfaces and by sixfold for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing, in both cases, the bulk water values. We also investigated the water channels at the interstitial voids of the bulk bundle material, finding 1D water channels that are similar to the surface ones.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 1D heat-transfer model to accurately determine the thermal properties of fine wires used in 3$ω$ measurements, accounting for thermal conduction from a jouled-heated wire to a surrounding gas across a wide range of pressures. The model is validated experimentally using a platinum wire in air, showing its effectiveness in extracting thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity even without a specific heat transfer coefficient model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work addresses the challenge of accurately measuring the thermal properties of fine wires, which is crucial for advancing nanoscale thermal metrology and understanding materials with low thermal conductivity.

Method: The authors developed a 1D heat-transfer model based on kinetic gas theory and solved it analytically. The model accounts for finite heat transfer coefficient $h$ and incorporates measurements at pressures spanning from $10^{-5}$ to $10^3$ mbar in air.

Result: The model successfully determines the wire's thermal conductivity $κ$ and volumetric heat capacity $ρc_p$ across various pressure regimes. Importantly, the model's accuracy spans from continuum to free-molecular gas regimes, and $h$ varies significantly with pressure.

Conclusion: This validated 1D model enhances the characterization of fine wires, enabling accurate thermal measurements of suspended wires as small as the nanometer scale, which is pivotal for future nanoscale thermal studies.

Abstract: The 3$ω$ method is widely used to measure the thermal conductivity and the specific heat of wires and thin films. These measurements are typically performed under high vacuum conditions, which justify the use of heat transfer models that exclude thermal losses to a surrounding fluid. Here, we study the effect of thermal conduction from a joule-heated wire to a surrounding gas on pressure-dependent 3$ω$ measurements, and show how a one-dimensional (1D) heat-transfer model may be used to reliably determine the wire's thermal properties. We derive a full analytical solution of the 1D heat-transfer equation with finite heat-transfer coefficient $h$ and validate it experimentally using a 16-$μ$m diameter platinum wire in air across pressures from $10^{-5}$ to $10^3$ mbar. We introduce a model for heat transfer between the wire and the surrounding gas based on kinetic gas theory that accurately describes the data across continuum to free-molecular gas regimes, with $h$ varying from near-zero in high vacuum to approximately 700 W/(m$^2\cdot$K) at atmospheric pressure. We show that use of a validated $h(p)$ model allows extracting both thermal conductivity $κ$ and volumetric heat capacity $ρc_p$, whereas volumetric heat capacity can be extracted even without invoking a specific $h(p)$ model. Our approach facilitates the characterization of fine wires with moderate to low thermal conductivities and may enable accurate thermal measurements of suspended wires with diameters on the nanometer scale.

Abstract: Antichiral surface states, characterized by unidirectional propagation on parallel surfaces, offer unique potential for controlling classical waves. However, their realization typically relies on complex implementations of the two-dimensional modified Haldane model, limiting practical applications. Here, we propose a simplified scheme to realize such states within the nodal-line semimetal phase of a single-layer honeycomb lattice, by emulating the essential physics of the modified Haldane model through an introduced layer degree of freedom. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unequal vertical interlayer couplings can generate valley higher-order topological partial bandgaps, hosting coexisting one-dimensional hinge states and gapped antichiral surface states. We numerically verify these multiple topological states in acoustic crystals, establishing a versatile platform for advanced wave manipulation.

Abstract: An increasing number of studies are moving towards the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity, where studying gravity from a very small source mass is a viable starting point. Preparing for such experiments, investigations of weak gravitational forces have employed mechanical resonators to detect time-dependent gravitational forces from actuated source masses. Here, we demonstrate a source mass approach which utilizes capacitive actuation of a 1 mg gold sphere embedded on a silicon nitride membrane, rather than piezoelectric or motorized actuation. The design simultaneously provides a method for microwave optomechanical implementation by coupling the membrane position to the electromagnetic mode of a 3D cavity. The cavity quality factor is not significantly compromised by electromagnetic leakage to the actuation electrode, allowing DC and kilohertz AC voltages to be introduced in the region where electric fields are strongly concentrated. We measure over 700 nm of driven oscillation amplitude and more than ten percent tunability in the mechanical resonance frequency of the loaded membrane, giving the potential to match the oscillations to the frequency range of a detector in future experiments. An optomechanical readout is demonstrated by measuring the cavity resonance at cryogenic temperatures, while room temperature measurements provide complimentary understanding of the mechanisms which influence the mechanical response, including repulsive contact due to collisions within the device.

Abstract: Double-wall cylindrical shells are widely used in applications where resistance to acoustic shock loading is critical. While the transient vibroacoustic behavior of single-walled shells has been extensively investigated, extending these analyses to double-wall cylindrical configurations introduces increased complexity due to multiple inter-shell acoustic reflections and strong coupling between acoustic fields and structural vibrations. These structures often feature mechanical interconnections between the shells to ensure structural integrity, load sharing, alignment, and enhanced resilience against static and dynamic loads. These links introduce additional pathways for vibration transmission and significantly influence the overall behavior of the system, thus making the analytical description of the coupled vibroacoustic response even more challenging. This study investigates the transient vibroacoustics of an inter-connected double-wall cylindrical shell subjected to an acoustic shock, considering fully coupled fluid-structure interactions. A comprehensive two-dimensional acoustoelastic model is developed in polar coordinates, incorporating the surrounding medium, the fluid occupying the inter-shell gap, and the fluid inside the inner shell. A semi-analytical solution method is employed to capture the time-domain evolution of acoustic fields and shell vibrations. The model's accuracy is verified by benchmarking against available data reported in the literature. Leveraging the passive dynamics of the system, we present a hybrid mechanism that integrates optimized nonlinear vibration absorbers with piezoelectric actuators to control the vibroacoustic behavior. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid mechanism in mitigating shock-induced acoustic pressure waves and enhancing the structural resilience of the double-wall cylindrical shell.

### [89] [Topological-Insulator and Spintronic Boundary Electrodynamics for MRI RF Coils: A Theoretical Framework for Loss, Noise, and Reciprocity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17949)
*Zoran Milosavljevic*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: MRI coils can be improved using topological insulators and spintronic effects to reduce losses and enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI technology is crucial for medical imaging, and optimizing coil performance is essential for reducing noise and improving image quality. This work aims to identify novel materials and effects that can enhance MRI coils.

Method: The study starts with the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response transport theory to develop a theoretical framework incorporating topological insulators and spintronic physics. It derives effective surface impedance, modifies boundary conditions, analyzes TI-ferromagnet interfaces, and connects results to MRI metrics.

Result: The framework shows that topological and spintronic effects can reduce radiofrequency dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable nonreciprocal responses in MRI coils without traditional ferrites.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for optimizing MRI coils using topological and spintronic materials, potentially improving image quality and reducing artifacts.

Abstract: MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites.

Conclusion: 通过系统优化方法和精确的理论分析，论文有效解决了硅 (Si) 基本体量子位中的谷分裂低且波动的问题。

Abstract: The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.

TL;DR: The article explains why recent experiments contradict earlier theoretical predictions about strongly asymmetric condensates. It argues that the time needed for equilibrium exceeds the experimental duration and thus the appropriate kinetic equation is the Boltzmann equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of condensates and their contradictions between experiments and theory is crucial for advancing quantum physics.

Method: The study uses kinetic theory and relates the critical pumping power to the effective temperature of over-condensate magnons.

Result: The research successfully bridges the gap between experimental and theoretical results by employing the Boltzmann kinetic equation.

Conclusion: This study enhances our understanding of quantum condensates and their behavior under various conditions.

Abstract: In this article, we explain the reason of the apparent contradiction between recent experiments [1] and [2] and earlier theoretical predictions [3] of strongly asymmetric condensate resulting in attractive interaction between the condensate magnons. We show that the relaxation time for equilibrium between two condensates at two minima of energy exceeds the time of experiment. Therefore, it should be described by Boltzmann kinetic equation. We develop the proper kinetic theory and find the relation between the critical pumping power and the effective temperature of over-condensate magnons.

Abstract: The time evolution of initially localized wavepackets in the discrete Hatano-Nelson lattice displays a rich dynamical structure shaped by the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity. Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials.

Abstract: Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.

Abstract: Amorphous oxide tunneling barriers, primarily formed from aluminum, represent one of the most widely adopted platforms for superconducting quantum bits (qubits). To overcome challenges associated with defects and sample variance among the tunneling barriers, the methodology of alternating bias assisted annealing (ABAA) was introduced in Pappas et. al[1]. The process of applying alternating bias to the barrier and subsequently aging before use was shown to reduce defects in the barrier. Namely, defects that give rise to two-level systems, coupling to the qubit and expediting decoherence. In this work we replicate an expedited ABAA process through a combination of ab-initio molecular dynamics and machine-learned potentials, illuminating how ABAA effects the energy landscape of the barrier.

Abstract: We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j>1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.

TL;DR:  confined water shows a lower auto-dissociation barrier and exhibits superdielectric and superionic properties due to confinement effects on hydrogen bonding and dipolar correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how nanoconfinement affects water's auto-dissociation and its resulting properties is crucial for various fields including geology, biology, and nanotechnology.

Method: ab-initio calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential MD were used to study monolayer-confined water.

Result: Confined water has a lower auto-dissociation barrier, quasi-2D dipolar correlations, and dielectric fluctuations leading to superdielectric and superionic behavior.

Conclusion: Confinement significantly alters water's properties, offering new insights into its behavior in geochemical, biomolecular, and nanofluidic systems.

Abstract: Water's ability to self-dissociate into H$_3$O$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions is central to acid-base chemistry and bioenergetics. Recent experimental advances have enabled the confinement of water down to the nanometre scale, even to the single-molecule limit, yet how this process is altered at the extreme nanoconfinement remains unclear. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped.

Conclusion: Fe4GeTe2提供了一个研究自旋、振动和电子相互作用动态变化的绝佳平台，在技术和材料科学中有重要应用。

Abstract: Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.

Conclusion: Zeeman量子几何为非传统磁体的磁性研究提供了强大的工具，通过gyrotropic响应可精确区分不同磁阶。

Abstract: Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses.

Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes offer a controlled setting to study correlated magnetism emerging from $π$-electron systems. We analyze oligo(indenoindene) molecules, non-bipartite carbon ladders whose tight-binding spectra feature a gapped, weakly dispersing manifold of quasi-zero modes, and show that their low-energy properties can be effectively mapped onto an interacting set of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. Using Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the full Fermi-Hubbard model, we obtain their excitation spectra, entanglement profiles, and spin-spin correlations. We then construct optimized delocalized fermionic modes that act as emergent spins and show that their interactions are well described by a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. This effective description clarifies how spin degrees of freedom arise and interact in non-bipartite nanographene ladders, providing a compact and accurate representation of their correlated behavior.

Abstract: Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold surfaces are one of the fundamental building blocks of molecular electronics. The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components.

Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) has recently been observed in various systems, sparking interest in novel superconducting devices and offering a new platform to probe intrinsic material properties. Josephson junctions with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling have exhibited nonreciprocal critical currents under applied magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate the SDE in Josephson junctions incorporating periodic hole arrays patterned into the superconducting leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial aluminum. We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction. These results highlight a new pathway for engineering and controlling nonreciprocal superconducting transport in hybrid systems.

Abstract: We investigated the anomalous Hall conductivity induced in silicon by circularly polarized light at room temperature using near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy. The time-resolved detection scheme eliminates the large nonlinear current generated by the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect, allowing exclusive observation of a long-lived anomalous Hall conductivity of photocarriers that depends on the helicity of NIR light. The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap. These results suggest the emergence of the inverse orbital Hall effect, paving the way for silicon-based orbitronics.

TL;DR: Skyrmions are stable magnetic textures that can be individually controlled and used for future memory and logic devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to advance the understanding and application of skyrmions, which are promising for future electronic devices. The ability to control individual skyrmions is a significant step towards practical implementations.

Method: The researchers used femtosecond laser pulses with diameters as small as 175 nm to optically write and erase skyrmions in ferrimagnetic Co/Gd multilayers. The system was able to control the spin textures without external magnetic fields.

Result: The field-free optical control of single skyrmions was achieved, allowing for precise manipulation of sub-micron-scale skyrmions. This technique overcomes limitations in previous methods and opens new possibilities for skyrmion-based technologies.

Conclusion: The work represents a breakthrough in optical control of skyrmions, paving the way for future applications in memory and logic devices. The demonstrated control mechanism could lead to improved efficiency and scalability in skyrmion-based systems.

Abstract: Skyrmions are highly stable chiral magnetic spin textures with non-trivial topology. They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand. Our work is envisioned to fuel applications of skyrmion-based applications and opens up further endeavors in research related to the behaviour of more complicated skyrmion-based textures.

Motivation: The paper investigates the resonance fluorescence (RF) of a solid-state quantum emitter coupled to phonon modes in a bulk semiconductor with a super-Ohmic spectral density. The motivation stems from understanding the interaction between quantum emitter and lattice vibrations, and how this coupling affects the optical response of the system.

Method: The authors employ a theoretical framework based on quantum optics and the Lindblad master equation to model the dynamics of the quantum emitter interacting with the phonon bath. They derive the RF spectrum by analyzing the transition rates between the emitter's ground and excited states, considering both single-phonon and multi-phonon processes.

Result: The RF spectrum of the quantum emitter exhibits a complex structure consisting of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband, and a narrow inelastic contribution. The interplay between these features leads to a Fano-like resonance profile under certain conditions. In the weak-coupling limit, the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape, and the resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The spectral amplitude grows linearly with temperature, while the linewidth depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate. Furthermore, Fano resonance persists even in the classical limit, and the redistribution of coupling efficiency between the central line and sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the resonance fluorescence of a quantum emitter coupled to a phonon bath. The findings reveal the intricate interplay between quantum and classical effects, and the conditions under which Fano-like resonance and optimal light scattering properties can be achieved. This research contributes to the understanding of quantum light-matter interactions in solid-state systems and has potential applications in quantum optics and photonics.

Abstract: We present a theory of resonance fluorescence (RF) of a solid-state quantum emitter in the regime of weak optical excitation. The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions.

Motivation: 自旋 qubit 是量子计算机中的重要组成部分，能够以高精度实现量子信息的存储和 Manipulation。然而，如何在没有机械移动的情况下，通过对电路或场进行电场调控来实现自旋 qubit 的操控一直是电路设计者和量子physicists 的难题。特别是，如何在电场的调控下，同时实现场旋 qubit 的不同自旋操作机制，这在理论和实验上都是极具挑战性的。

Method: 通过在半导体细 Fin 结构中的微波信号应用到两个不同的基极门电路，可以分别控制载流子自旋 qubit 的不同自旋操作机制。具体来说，通过调整微波信号作用到第一个基极门电路，可以实现场旋 qubit 中的 g 因子模量电位移主导的自旋操作。通过调整微波信号作用到第二个基极门电路，可以实现场旋 qubit 中的态波函数位移主导的自旋操作。

Abstract: Hole-spin qubits enable fast, all-electrical spin manipulation through electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), arising from two microscopic mechanisms rooted in their intrinsically strong spin-orbit interaction. Depending on how the electric field acts on the quantum dot, the spin can be driven either by a modulation of its g-factor or by a displacement of the wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance.

Abstract: In Si quantum dot systems, large magnetic field gradients are needed to implement spin rotations via electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR). By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures.

We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenide ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum algorithm for the discrete Laplace transform is presented with complexity O((log N)^3), offering a superpolynomial speedup over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Laplace transform is a fundamental tool in various scientific and engineering domains. Implementing it efficiently on quantum computers could open new possibilities for quantum algorithms in solving differential equations, inverse transforms, and spectral analysis of non-Hermitian matrices.

Method: The algorithm leverages Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation and Lap-LCHS, inspired by the efficient QFT implementation, using Taylor series approximation for the Laplace transform, which circumvents the challenge of non-unitary dynamics.

Result: The quantum algorithm achieves an O((log N)^3) gate complexity for N x N discrete Laplace transforms, a superpolynomial speedup compared to classical O(N log N) complexity.

Conclusion: This breakthrough provides a foundational tool for quantum computing, with potential applications across multiple disciplines, enhancing our ability to tackle complex scientific problems efficiently.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm to perform the Laplace transform on quantum computers. Already, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the cornerstone of many quantum algorithms, but the Laplace transform or its discrete version has not seen any efficient implementation on quantum computers due to its dissipative nature and hence non-unitary dynamics. However, a recent work has shown an efficient implementation for certain cases on quantum computers using the Taylor series. Unlike previous work, our work provides a completely different algorithm for doing Laplace Transform using Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation and Lap-LCHS, very efficiently at points which form an arithmetic progression. Our algorithm can implement $N \times N$ discrete Laplace transform in gate complexity that grows as $O((log\,N)^3)$, ignoring the state preparation cost, where $N=2^n$ and $n$ is the number of qubits, which is a superpolynomial speedup in number of gates over the best classical counterpart that has complexity $O(N\cdot log\,N)$ for the same cases. Also, the circuit width grows as $O(log\,N)$. Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT) may enable new Quantum algorithms for cases like solving differential equations in the Laplace domain, developing an inverse Laplace transform algorithm on quantum computers, imaginary time evolution in the resolvent domain for calculating ground state energy, and spectral estimation of non-Hermitian matrices.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to re-examine a well-known thought experiment in quantum mechanics and adapt it for modern educational purposes, particularly targeting young scientists interested in quantum theory.

Method: Our method involves taking Schrödinger's cat experiment and reinterpreting it within a Bayesian subjectivist framework within quantum theory. Specifically, we treat the cat as a remote measurement problem where Alice and Bob, who are spatially separated but share a quantum state, update their beliefs about their respective systems after conducting local measurements.

We demonstrate that this approach can be effectively utilized in quantum theory education, potentially making the concept more accessible to young scientists.

Conclusion: The conclusion of this paper is that Schrödinger's cat experiment can be usefully repurposed as a teaching tool in quantum theory, particularly through a Bayesian subjectivist lens. This approach not only deepens the understanding of quantum mechanics but also aligns with modern educational practices in the field.

Abstract: Floquet codes have recently emerged as a new family of error-correcting codes, and have drawn significant interest across both theoretical and practical quantum computing. A central open question has been how to implement logical operations on these codes. In this work, we show how two techniques from static quantum error-correcting codes can also be implemented on Floquet codes. First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression. Our results show that these logical operations are robust, featuring a performance that is close to the baseline set by a quantum memory benchmark. Finally, we explain in detail how to implement logical gates on Floquet codes by operating on the embedded codes.

Abstract: The nonequilibrium thermodynamics of interacting quantum many-body systems is investigated within the framework of thermal time-dependent density functional theory using a generalized linear-response formulation for the full quantum work statistics. A first-principles route is established to reconstruct the relaxation function that underlies linear-response theory, thereby moving beyond phenomenological descriptions and enabling a consistent evaluation of all moments of the dissipated-work distribution in interacting systems. The predictive power of the approach is demonstrated for the Hubbard model subject to a staggered external potential, where the evolution of the relaxation dynamics across the Mott-to-band-insulator crossover reveals how distinct many-body phases shape the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic response. These results provide a microscopic and transferable framework for quantum thermodynamics in correlated systems, bridging thermal density functional theory and nonequilibrium work statistics.

Abstract: For a century, quantum theory has posed a fundamental challenge to philosophical thinking. On its face, it repudiates many of the key features of the mechanical conception of physical reality. However, the challenge of developing a precise, coherent alternative to that conception has yet to be met. Here, I argue that a major hindrance to the project of quantum interpretation is its existing interpretative methodologies, which suffer from a lack of systematicity in their judgements about what aspects of the theory are interpretational relevant. In particular, I argue that current interpretations tend to marginalize the informal part of the theory in favour of its formal part, and place inappropriate emphasis on the natural language component of the formalism over its detailed mathematical structure. To counterbalance these biases, I propose that an interpretation-free zone be constructed around the theory, wherein an interpreter initially adopt a descriptive stance which considers all parts of the theory, and that the results of this deliberation~(and the judgements about what facts are interpretationally relevant) are reported as part of their interpretation.
  I argue that the interpretation of quantum theory poses special challenges and difficulties which necessitate this interpretation-free zone, and that existing interpretative methodologies are insufficient to address them. Further, I argue that a reconstructive interpretative methodology, which harnesses the recent results of the quantum reconstruction program, provides a powerful means to identify almost all facts that could be interpretationally relevant, and naturally meets these challenges and difficulties. Moreover, I argue that the quantum reconstruction program offers a powerful way to discover new physical principles, and offers a systematic pathway to build a rich, coherent conception of quantum reality.

Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computers based on segmented traps rely on shuttling operations to establish connectivity between multiple sub-registers within a quantum processing unit. Several architectures of increasing complexity have already been realized, including linear arrays, racetrack loops, and junction-based layouts. As hardware capabilities advance, the need arises for flexible software layers within the control stack to manage qubit routing$\unicode{x2014}$the process of dynamically reconfiguring qubit positions so that all qubits involved in a gate operation are co-located within the same segment. Existing approaches typically employ architecture-specific heuristics, which become impractical as system complexity grows. To address this challenge, we propose a layout-independent compilation strategy based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we fine-tune pretrained LLMs to generate the required shuttling operations. We evaluate this approach on both linear and branched one-dimensional architectures, demonstrating that it provides a foundation for developing LLM-based shuttling compilers for trapped-ion quantum computers.

Abstract: The quantum dissipative time evolution of a fluxonium under a pulsed field (kicks) is studied numerically and analytically. In the classical limit the system dynamics is converged to a strange chaotic attractor. The quantum properties of this system are studied for the density matrix in the frame of Lindblad equation. In the case of dissipative quantum evolution the steady-state density matrix is converged to a quantum strange attractor being similar to the classical one. It is shown that depending on the dissipation strength there is a regime when the eigenstates of density matrix are localized at a strong or moderate dissipation. At a weak dissipation the eigenstates are argued to be delocalized being linked to the Ehrenfest explosion of quantum wave packet. This phenomenon is related with the Lyapunov exponent and Ehrenfest time for the quantum strange attractor. Possible experimental realisations of this quantum strange attractor with fluxonium are discussed.

Abstract: Developing fault-tolerant quantum processors with error correction demands large arrays of physical qubits whose key performance metrics (coherence times, control fidelities) must remain within specifications over both short and long timescales. Here we investigated the temporal stability of subtractively fabricated CMOS-compatible superconducting transmon qubits. During a single cooldown and over a period of 95 hours, we monitored several parameters for 8 qubits, including coherence times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, which exhibit fluctuations originating primarily from the interaction between two-level system (TLS) defects and the host qubit. We also demonstrate that subtractively-fabricated superconducting quantum devices align with the theoretical predictions that higher mean lifetimes $T_1$ correspond to larger fluctuations. To assess long-term stability, we tracked two representative qubits over 10 cooldown cycles spanning more than one year. We observed an average total downward shift in both qubit transition frequencies of approximately 61 MHz within the thermal cycles considered. In contrast, readout resonator frequencies decreased only marginally. Meanwhile, $T_1$ exhibits fluctuations from cycle to cycle, but maintains a stable baseline value.

Abstract: Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\unboldmath$λ/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms have begun to leverage quantum devices to efficiently represent many-electron wavefunctions, enabling early demonstrations of molecular simulations on real hardware. A key prerequisite for scalable quantum chemistry, however, is size consistency: the energy of non-interacting subsystems must scale linearly with system size. While many algorithms are theoretically size-consistent, noise on quantum devices may couple nominally independent subsystems and degrade this fundamental property. Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a general, gradient-based method that optimises codewords for a given noise channel and fixed recovery. We do so by differentiating fidelity and descending on the complex coefficients using finite-difference Wirtinger gradients with soft penalties to promote orthonormalisation. We validate the gradients on symmetry checks (XXX/ZZZ repetition codes) and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code, then demonstrate substantial gains under isotropic Pauli noise with Petz recovery: fidelity improves from 0.783 to 0.915 in 100 steps for an isotropic Pauli noise of strength 0.05. The procedure is deterministic, highly parallelisable, and highly scalable.

Abstract: The classicality of the Gamma Model, an analytically solvable quantum oscillator with non-linear dynamics, is investigated using the overlap dynamics, also known as the Loschmidt Echo, and roughness, a classicality measure based on the Wigner representation of a state. Though the overlap dynamics would indicate a chaotic regime, here the model is integrable. The time mean of the overlap function decays inversely with the effective Hilbert space occupied by the initial state for the non-periodic case. Two different stationary regimes were found for the overlap mean and overlap variance. The state non-classicality was investigated using the roughness measure, and its mean also has two stationary regimes. For large effective Hilbert space, the roughness time mean depends more on the effective space than the initial state. While the Wigner function is dominated by the non-diagonal terms, the overlap operator has some contribution on each part, but it is more affected by the diagonal terms than the density matrix.

Conclusion: Quantum correlations and coherence play essential roles in quantum thermodynamics. Non-Markovian dynamics are beneficial for quantum engine efficiency, suggesting future optimizations in relativistic quantum devices.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between quantum thermodynamics, quantum correlations, and quantum coherence within the framework of the Unruh-DeWitt (UdW) detector model. By analyzing both the steady and dynamical states of various quantum resources (including steerability, entanglement, quantum discord, and coherence), we study how these resources evolve under Markovian and non-Markovian environments. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of both the Unruh temperature and the energy levels on three key quantum phenomena: thermodynamic evolution, quantum correlations, and quantum coherence, considering different initial state preparations. The hierarchical structure relating quantum correlations and quantum coherence is determined. We further examine the thermodynamic performance of a quantum heat engine, highlighting the influence of memory effects and classical correlations on heat exchange, work extraction, and efficiency. Our results reveal that non-Markovian dynamics can enhance the preservation of quantum correlations and improve the engine's efficiency compared to purely Markovian regime. These findings provide insights into the role of quantum correlations and quantum coherence in quantum thermodynamic processes and open avenues for optimizing quantum devices operating in relativistic or open-system settings.

Abstract: Polymers exhibit complex architectures and diverse properties that place them at the center of contemporary research in chemistry and materials science. As conventional computational techniques, even multi-scale ones, struggle to capture this complexity, quantum computing offers a promising alternative framework for extracting structure-property relationships. Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are commonly used to explore the implementation of algorithms, including quantum neural networks for classification tasks, despite ongoing debate regarding their practical impact.
  We present a hybrid classical-quantum formalism that couples a classical deep neural network for polymer featurization with a single-photon-based quantum classifier native to photonic quantum computing. This pipeline successfully classifies polymer species by their optical gap, with performance in line between CPU-based noisy simulations and a proof-of-principle run on Quandela's Ascella quantum processor. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed computational workflow and indicate that chemistryfrelated classification tasks can already be tackled under the constraints of today's NISQ devices.

Abstract: We investigate the optimization of epsilon-security parameters in quantum key distribution (QKD), aiming to improve the achievable secure key rate under a fixed overall composable security level. For this purpose, we employ a continuous genetic algorithm (CGA) to optimize the epsilon-security components of two representative protocols: the homodyne protocol from the continuous-variable (CV) family and the BB84 protocol from the discrete-variable (DV) family. We detail the CGA configuration, summarize the derivation of the composable key rate, and emphasize the role of the epsilon-parameters in both protocols. We then compare key rates obtained with optimized epsilon-values against those derived from standard and randomized choices. Our results demonstrate substantial key rate improvements at high security levels, where the key rate typically vanishes, and uncover positive-rate regimes that are inaccessible without optimization.

Abstract: Crosstalk between qubits fundamentally limits the scalability of quantum processors, necessitating physics-based models that can handle the complexity of large qubit arrays. Here, we develop a comprehensive theoretical and experimental framework that captures residual interactions between both adjacent and non-adjacent qubits in fixed-frequency transmon lattices. The model integrates the combined effects of exponential localization in banded capacitance matrices, suppression of virtual couplings through detuning products across intermediate modes, and evanescent decay of below-cutoff electromagnetic fields, yielding predictive scaling relations for coupling strength as a function of spatial separation and spectral detuning. Experimental characterization of a $4 \times 4$ superconducting-qubit lattice with inductive shunt pillars reveals exponential spatial decay and frequency-dependent suppression consistent with theoretical predictions, achieving quantitative agreement for all nearest-neighbor couplings across the \qtyrange[range-phrase = --, range-units = single]{4}{6}{\giga\hertz} operating range. Our results show that standard dispersive Hamiltonian approximations systematically overestimate long-range coupling when spatial and spectral dependencies are neglected; these errors propagate into circuit simulation and design strategies. Our framework provides design guidance for crosstalk mitigation in larger-scale quantum processors under realistic fabrication constraints, addressing a bottleneck in scalability.

Abstract: Most quantum error correction (QEC) protocols for superconducting qubits assume spatially and temporally uncorrelated decoherence events; however, recent evidence suggests that cosmic radiation induces spatially correlated errors. We present a platform that sandwiches a superconducting transmon qubit between two microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) arrays, enabling real-time detection of radiation-induced phonon bursts. By synchronizing MKID event detection with single-shot measurements of qubit energy relaxation ($T_1$) and phase coherence ($T_2$), we observe statistically significant reductions in both $T_1$ and $T_2$-up to 30.5%-immediately following dual MKID events attributed to penetrating muons. Our findings directly link radiating events to correlated qubit decoherence. Furthermore, our experimental platform provides a foundation for systematic studies of radiation effects, the development of shielding and mitigation techniques, and the refinement of error-correction algorithms tailored to correlated noise sources.

Abstract: Cryogenic microwave measurement of superconducting quantum devices is complicated by the packaging required to connect devices to control and readout circuitry. In this work, we outline the design and experimental demonstration of a wirebond-free, PCB-free, drop-in microwave package for on-chip superconducting quantum devices. The package is composed of a superconducting aluminum cavity with a suspended tungsten transmission pin. The fundamental package cavity mode is far detuned from the 4 GHz to 8 GHz band of interest, and the pin transmission exhibits less than 3 dB of ripple across this range. We demonstrate the use of this package to extract the loss tangent of superconducting ring resonators, measuring a value of (1.10 +- 0.09) x 10^-6, which agrees with measurements of lambda/4 resonators in wirebond-based packaging. This high-throughput measurement system will allow the rapid generation of large datasets for improving superconducting qubit performance, and facilitate time-sensitive surface passivation and oxide regrowth studies.

Abstract: Implementing arbitrary functions of Hermitian matrices on quantum hardware is a foundational task in quantum computing, critical for accurate Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear system solving, high-fidelity state preparation, machine learning kernels, and other advance quantum algorithms. Existing state-of-the-art techniques, including Qubitization, Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), and Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), rely heavily on block-encoding the Hermitian matrix. These methods are often constrained by the complexity of preparing the block-encoded state, the overhead associated with the required ancillary qubits, or the challenging problem of angle synthesis for the polynomial's phase factors, which limits the achievable circuit depth and overall efficiency.
  In this work, we propose a novel and resource-efficient approach to implement arbitrary polynomials of a Hermitian matrix, by leveraging the Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (GQSP) framework. Our method circumvents the need for block-encoding by expressing the target Hermitian matrix as a symmetric combination of unitary conjugates, enabling polynomial synthesis via GQSP circuits applied to each unitary component. We derive closed-form expressions for symmetric polynomial expansions and demonstrate how linear combinations of GQSP circuits can realize the desired transformation. This approach reduces resource overhead, and opens new pathways for quantum algorithm design for functions of Hermitian matrices.

Abstract: Recent developments in the unification of quantum mechanics and relativity have emphasized the necessity of generalizing classical phase space into a relativistic quantum phase space which is a framework that inherently incorporates the uncertainty principle and relativistic covariance. In this context, the present work considers the derivation of linear and quadratic Casimir operators corresponding to representations of the Linear Canonical Transformations (LCT) group associated with a five-dimensional spacetime of signature (1,4). This LCT group, which emerges naturally as the symmetry group of the relativistic quantum phase space, is isomorphic to the symplectic group Sp(2,8). The latter notably contains the de Sitter group SO(1,4) as a subgroup. This geometric setting provides a unified framework for extending the Standard Model of particle physics while incorporating cosmological features. Previous studies have shown that the LCT group admits both fermionic-like and bosonic-like representations. Within this framework, a novel classification of quarks and leptons, including sterile neutrinos, has also been proposed. In this work, we present a systematic derivation of the linear and quadratic Casimir operators associated with these representations, motivated by their fundamental role in the characterization of symmetry groups in physics. The construction is based on the relations between the LCT group and the pseudo-unitary group U(1,4). Three linears and three quadratics Casimir operators are identified: two corresponding to the fermionic-like representation, two to the bosonic-like representation, and two hybrid operators linking the two representations. The complete eigenvalue spectra and corresponding eigenstates for each operator are subsequently computed and identified

Abstract: Quantum walk based hash functions have attracted a lot of attention in recent years because of its faster execution time and robust resistance against attacks compared to classical hash functions. It has been observed that the underlying graph and the way message controls the quantum walk iteration steps play a crucial role for the robustness of the hash function. We propose a quantum hash function based on the discrete-time quantum walk on a Hanoi network--a one dimensional periodic lattice with extra long-range edges of a specific form--which is highly collision resistant. The message bits of our scheme control the flow of probability amplitude through the extra long-range edges and the conditional shift operators. Our method even works for messages with small bit-lengths, contrary to most of the quantum walk based hash functions defined on a cycle, which usually work for messages with bit-lengths more than the length of the cycle.

Abstract: We propose an evolutionary belief propagation (EBP) decoder for quantum error correction, which incorporates trainable weights into the BP algorithm and optimizes them via the differential evolution algorithm. This approach enables end-to-end optimization of the EBP combined with ordered statistics decoding (OSD).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new methodology for cyber risk assessment using QUBO is proposed, leveraging both classical and quantum computing to address scalability challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evolving digital systems make traditional risk assessment methods inadequate, prompting the need for a scalable, quantum-friendly approach.

Method: The method involves modeling cyber risk as a QUBO problem, tested on networks of varying sizes up to 1000 nodes, comparing classical, quantum, and hybrid workflows.

Result: Quantum annealing shows promise but is limited by hardware constraints. Hybrid methods outperform both classical and quantum approaches.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining quantum and classical solvers is recommended for effective scaling in large-scale cyber risk assessment.

Abstract: Assessing cyber risk in complex IT infrastructures poses significant challenges due to the dynamic, interconnected nature of digital systems. Traditional methods often fall short, relying on static and largely qualitative models that do not scale with system complexity and fail to capture systemic interdependencies. In this work, we introduce a novel quantitative approach to cyber risk assessment based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a formulation compatible with both classical computing and quantum annealing. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic 255-nodes layered infrastructure, showing how risk spreads in non-trivial patterns that are difficult to identify through visual inspection alone. To assess scalability, we further conduct extensive experiments on networks up to 1000 nodes comparing classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Our results reveal that although quantum annealing produces solutions comparable to classical heuristics, its potential advantages are significantly hindered by the embedding overhead required to map the densely connected cyber-risk QUBO onto the limited connectivity of current quantum hardware. By contrast, hybrid quantum-classical solvers avoid this bottleneck and therefore emerge as a promising option, combining competitive scaling with an improved ability to explore the solution space and identify more stable risk configurations. Overall, this work delivers two main advances. First, we present a rigorous, tunable, and generalizable mathematical model for cyber risk that can be adapted to diverse infrastructures and domains through flexible parameterization. Second, we provide the first comparative study of classical, quantum, and hybrid approaches for cyber risk scoring at scale, highlighting the emerging potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods for large-scale infrastructures.

Abstract: Source-independent quantum secret sharing (SI QSS), while essential for secure multiuser cryptographic operations in quantum networks, faces significant implementation challenges stemming from the inherent complexity of generating and distributing multipartite entangled states. Recently, a resource-efficient SI QSS protocol utilizing entangled photon pairs combined with a postmatching method has been proposed to address this limitation. In this Letter, we report an experimental demonstration of this protocol using high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs in a star topology. For a three-user network, we obtain secure key rates of 21.18, 4.69, and 1.71 kbps under single-user channel losses of 7.6, 10.9, and 12.9 dB respectively. Furthermore, under conditions of equal channel loss per user, we achieve secure key rates of 6.97, 6.46, and 5.88 kbps for three-, four-, and five-user scenarios respectively. These results demonstrate the advantageous independence of the key rate from the number of users. Our work paves the way for large-scale deployment of SI QSS in multiuser quantum networks.

Abstract: Recently, Sharoglazova et al. claimed to have proven a violation of the basic tenet of Bohmian mechanics, namely the phase-speed relation $\vec{v}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{m}\vec{\nabla}S(\vec{r},t)$. Here, $S(\vec{r},t)$ is the (real) phase of the wave function $ψ(\vec{r},t)=ρ^{\frac{1}{2}}(\vec{r},t)e^{iS(\vec{r},t)}$. In a nutshell, they have measured the speed of a claimed evanescent wave, which is real and therefore must have $\vec{\nabla}S=\vec{0}$. However, Fig. 2 clearly shows a density motion from one waveguide to the other, implying a nonzero density current, $\vec{j}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\hbar}{2mi}\Im(ψ^*\vec{\nabla}ψ)$. If we combine this evidence with the mathematical identity $\vec{\nabla}S=\frac{m}ρ\vec{j}$, we should instead conclude that $\vec{\nabla}S\neq\vec{0}$. So, where does this apparent inconsistency come from?

### [141] [Quantum Imaging of Birefringent Samples using Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19637)
*Carolina Gonçalves,Tiago D. Ferreira,Catarina S. Monteiro,Nuno A. Silva*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a quantum-based imaging technique for birefringent structures using a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer. A narrowband photon pair source with a coherence length over 1 mm is used to broaden the HOM interference dip, enabling the measurement of polarization rotation caused by sample-induced effects despite sample thickness variations. A statistical model is developed to compute the polarization rotation, and a maximum-likelihood estimator is applied for determining the fast-axis angles. Experimental results validate the method, achieving high precision and showing insensitivity to sample thickness, with potential applications in quantum imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop advanced quantum-based imaging techniques for measuring polarization changes in birefringent materials, which can enhance imaging resolution and stability across different layers of a sample. This is particularly important for applications requiring high precision, such as in biological tissues or layered materials where sample thickness can vary significantly.

Method: The method involves using a narrowband photon pair source, a concept originally developed for quantum sensing, to create a broader HOM interference dip. By doing so, the method circumvents the limitation of traditional HOM-based sensing where the interference dip's sensitivity to optical path differences restricts sample thickness measurement. They measure polarization changes instead of relying on temporal distinguishability of photons. A statistical model for the interferometer and a Fisher information approach are used to derive the Fisher information and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the fast-axis angles. The experimental setup includes scanning the sample to capture dip and baseline frames, enabling the calculation of polarization rotation angles across different sample positions.

Result: The results demonstrate that the developed technique achieves realistic sample thickness measurements with high precision, up to a few micrometers, by circumventing the interference-based constraint. The method shows good agreement with classical polarized-intensity imaging techniques while also highlights its advantages, such as a maximum-precision regime and insensitivity to layer thickness changes. This makes the method robust and reliable for imaging birefringent structures across various samples.

Conclusion: This paper presents a novel approach for quantum-based imaging of birefringent structures by leveraging HOM interference with a photon pair source. The method overcomes traditional limitations related to sample thickness and polarization effects, offering a high-precision imaging solution with broad applicability. The development of a statistical model and maximum-likelihood estimator provides a robust framework for analyzing polarization rotations, and experimental validation confirms the technique's effectiveness and versatility in various imaging scenarios. This work opens new possibilities for quantum-enhanced imaging applications in diverse fields.

Abstract: Two-photon interference in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer can be used as a quantum sensing mechanism due to the sensitivity of the interference dip to perturbations of the photon indistinguishability. In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length >1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness. Overall, the approach enclosed provides a quantum-based quantitative imaging of birefringent structures, which can motivate further advantageous applications, including enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and lower damage imaging of photosensitive samples.

Abstract: We introduce a locally symplectic-invariant quantifier of correlations between two different arbitrary modes in bosonic Gaussian systems, denoted by $\mathcal{D}^{\mathrm{sym}}$. This quantity admits a simple geometric interpretation as an overlap between each mode and the purification partner of the other, formulated using the complex-structure description of Gaussian states. The construction builds on the partner-mode framework of Ref.~\cite{agullo_correlation_2025} and can be viewed as a symmetrized extension of earlier overlap-based measures~\cite{osawa2025entanglement}. We formulate a simple necessary and sufficient criterion for two-mode entanglement in Gaussian states in terms of $\mathcal{D}^{\mathrm{sym}}$, placing on firm quantitative footing the intuition that entanglement with a given localized mode `lives' on the spatial support of its partner mode. We illustrate the framework with a numerical analysis of a scalar field in Minkowski spacetime and discuss its extension to multimode systems and mixed Gaussian states.

Abstract: The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describes the effective dynamics of a system coupled to a continuously measured bath, and can exhibit anti-unitary symmetries that give rise to exceptional points and broken phases with complex eigenvalues, features unique to non-Hermitian systems. Going beyond conventional Hermitian physics, we analyze the impact of non-Hermiticity in the quantum state transmission by employing a non-Hermitian spin chain that functions as a quantum data bus. By deriving a general expression for the fidelity of quantum state transfer for a U(1)-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we analyze PT-symmetric XX and SSH models, complemented by a numerical study of the RT-symmetric iXY model. We demonstrate that, in several parameter regimes, the transfer fidelity in the non-Hermitian setting exceeds the classical threshold and can even exceed the performance of the corresponding Hermitian models. In particular, for the SSH model with dominant inter-cell coupling, the broken phase supports near-unit-fidelity quantum state transfer, a level of performance that the corresponding Hermitian model fails to attain. Moreover, we establish a correspondence between the non-Hermitian and Hermitian descriptions by identifying related parameter regions in which the fidelity fails to surpass the classical bound.

Abstract: Topological quantum matter represents a flexible playground to engineer unconventional excitations. While non-interacting topological single-particle systems have been studied in detail, topology in quantum many-body systems remains an open problem. Specifically, in the quantum many-body limit, one of the challenges lies in the computational complexity of obtaining the many-body ground state and its many-body topological invariant. While algorithms to compute ground states with quantum computers have been heavily investigated, algorithms to compute topological invariants in a quantum computer are still under active development. Here we demonstrate a quantum circuit to compute the many-body topological invariant of a second-order topological quantum magnet encoded in qubits. Our algorithm relies on a quantum circuit adiabatic evolution in transverse paths in parameter space, and we uncover hidden topological invariants depending on the traversed path. Our work puts forward an algorithm to leverage quantum computers to characterize many-body topological quantum matter.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new paradigm for quantum image representation using sparse dot encoding optimized for neutral-atom devices is introduced. The method avoids digital basis-state coding by encoding visual information through physical atom placement, reducing qubit requirements and costs. It uses cartographic generalization and feature pruning, prunes sparse dot images to compress representations without loss. The approach is tested through matching tasks with an image database, showing feasibility for quantum-native machine learning in image processing. It highlights scalability and efficiency compared to classical AI frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic cost scaling with qubits is a bottleneck in quantum image processing. This work proposes an efficient encoding method to overcome this limitation, showcasing the potential of neutral-atom quantum devices in handling resource-intensive tasks like image processing.

Method: The method involves three key steps: (1) cartographic generalization of classical edge-extracted images to create a sparse-dot geometric description, ensuring structural integrity, (2) embedding this sparse representation into the physical configuration of neutral-atom devices using Bloqade simulation, and (3) pruning the sparse dot images to reduce qubit count without fidelity loss.

Result: The approach was successfully evaluated through feature matching tasks with an image database. The resulting quantum-native images demonstrated feasibility for image matching applications, outperforming classical AI-based methods in terms of resource efficiency.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for quantum-native machine learning pipelines in image processing. By encoding visual information through physical atom placement, it addresses the qubit cost bottleneck of digital quantum image processing, bringing scalable quantum computing solutions to visual data processing tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a fundamentally new paradigm for quantum image representation tailored for neutral-atom quantum devices. The proposed method constructs a qubit-efficient image representation by first applying a cartographic generalization algorithm to a classical edge-extracted input image, yielding a highly optimized sparse-dot based geometric description. While ensuring the structural integrity of the image, this sparse representation is then embedded into the atomic configuration of Aquila (QuEra Computing Inc.), modeled through the Bloqade simulation software stack. By encoding visual information through physical atom placement rather than digital basis-state coding, the approach avoids the costly state-preparation overhead inherent to digital quantum image processing circuits. Additionally, pruning sparse dot images, akin to map feature reduction, compresses representations without fidelity loss, thereby substantially reducing qubit requirements when implemented on an analog neutral-atom quantum device. The resulting quantum-native images have been successfully evaluated through matching tasks against an image database, thus illustrating the feasibility of this approach for image matching applications. Since sparse-dot image representations enable seamless generation of synthetic datasets, this work constitutes an initial step towards fully quantum-native machine-learning pipelines for visual data and highlights the potential of scalable analog quantum computing to enable resource-efficient alternatives to energy-intensive classical AI-based image processing frameworks.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is considered a promising class of problems in which quantum computers can show significant advantages. However, problems of practical relevance typically have more variables than current or foreseeable quantum computers have qubits. Here we introduce a divide and conquer approach that partitions the optimization problem into subgraphs that can be represented on smaller quantum processors. We then find all states of the subgraphs that can possibly be part of the solution to the entire problem by determining the cost or energy ranges in which the local subgraph energies of these states must be contained. This allows us to reduce the problem by only considering the subspace spanned by these states. We then recombine the system using a binary encoding for each subgraph with a local energy ordering. This process can be iterated until no further reduction is possible. We also find that the number of necessary qubits can be reduced further when only retaining states in a fraction of the relevant energy range at very little expense in terms of approximation ratio to the global ground state. In numerical simulations, we find that our approach allows us to solve combinatorial optimization problems on weighted random 3-regular graphs with $|\mathcal{V}|=40$ discrete variables on $\sim |\mathcal{V}| / 4$ qubits while retaining a possible approximation ratio of $\sim99.9\%$. We also observe an increasing reduction with larger system sizes.

Abstract: Modern experiments in resonators are moving to ever more extreme quantum regimes, posing major challenges to established theoretical approaches, such as so-called few-mode models. While these models have driven major insights for traditional regimes, they are now hitting their limitations for highly open cavities and extended systems, as encountered in cavity experiments with molecules and solid-state systems. Here, we present a novel method that significantly extends the conceptual underpinning of these discrete-mode models, promoting them to a systematic treatment. We develop an ansatz which allows to quantize the resonator's resonances with position-resolved discrete modes, thus naturally incorporating losses in the formalism. Such a construction effectively unifies key ideas from pseudomodes and quantized quasi-normal modes theory. We further present a criterion for construction of the ansatz parameters at every point in space, and semi-analytically benchmark the resulting solution for a paradigmatic one-dimensional example resonator.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two trapped ions interacting with a common thermal reservoir, focusing on how cross-correlated dissipation influences heating, steady-state behavior, and parameter sensitivity. Starting from a microscopic system--reservoir model, we derive the corresponding Heisenberg--Langevin equations and show that reservoir-induced correlations generate collective decay channels and, when the cross-damping rate matches the local damping, a decoherence-free normal mode that preserves memory of the initial excitations. Using the Fisher information associated with motional population measurements, we identify the parameter regimes in which cross-damping enhances the estimability of both system and reservoir properties. For nonclassical initial states, we also show that reservoir-mediated correlations can generate or maintain entanglement, with the strongest effects occurring near the decoherence-free condition.

Abstract: We present a multifractal analysis of time series data obtained by repeatedly running a single-qubit quantum circuit on IBM superconducting quantum computers, in which the measurement outcomes are recorded as the number of zeros. By applying advanced signal processing techniques, including the wavelet leader method and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we uncover strong multifractal behavior in the output data. This finding indicates that the temporal fluctuations inherent to quantum circuit outputs are not purely random but exhibit complex scaling properties across multiple time scales. The multifractal nature of the signal suggests the possibility of tailoring filtering strategies that specifically target these scaling features to effectively mitigate noise in quantum computations. Our results not only contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamical properties of quantum systems under repeated measurement but also provide a promising avenue for improving noise reduction techniques in near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Threat detection models in cybersecurity must keep up with shifting traffic, strict feature budgets, and noisy hardware, yet even strong classical systems still miss rare or borderline attacks when the data distribution drifts. Small, near-term quantum processors are now available, but existing work rarely shows whether quantum components can improve end-to-end detection under these unstable, resource constrained conditions rather than just adding complexity. We address this gap with a hybrid architecture that uses a compact multilayer perceptron to compress security data and then routes a few features to 2-4 qubit quantum heads implemented as quantum support vector machines and variational circuits. Under matched preprocessing and training budgets, we benchmark these hybrids against tuned classical baselines on two security tasks, network intrusion detection on NSL-KDD and spam filtering on Ling-Spam datasets, and then deploy the best 4-qubit quantum SVM to an IBM Quantum device with noise-aware execution (readout mitigation and dynamical decoupling). Across both datasets, shallow quantum heads consistently match, and on difficult near-boundary cases modestly reduce, missed attacks and false alarms relative to classical models using the same features. Hardware results track simulator behavior closely enough that the remaining gap is dominated by device noise rather than model design. Taken together, the study shows that even on small, noisy chips, carefully engineered quantum components can already function as competitive, budget-aware elements in practical threat detection pipelines.

Result:  certification under MI and PI relaxation, polylog local dimension sufficiency, new locality concepts, and relation between PI relaxation and detection inefficiency for RNG 

Conclusion: Significant progress toward device-independent applications under weak assumptions.

Abstract: The question of certifying quantum nonlocality under a relaxation of the assumptions in the Bell theorem has gained traction, with potential for device-independent applications under weak seeds and cross-talk. Recently, it was shown that quantum nonlocality can be certified even under a simultaneous arbitrary (but not full) relaxation of the assumptions of Measurement Independence (MI) and Parameter Independence (PI), using states of local dimension $d = poly((1-ε)^{-1})$ for an $ε\in [0,1)$-relaxation. Here, we derive three results strengthening the state-of-art. Firstly, we show that states of constant local dimension $d$ are already sufficient to certify quantum nonlocality under arbitrary MI and PI relaxation, albeit in a non-robust manner. Secondly, and as a theoretical paradigm to derive the above, we introduce the notion of \textit{measurement-dependent parameter-dependent locality} as the set of input-output behaviors under simultaneous relaxations of measurement and parameter independence. We provide a rigorous characterisation of the vertices of the polytope of joint input-output behaviors that obey a $μ$-relaxation of MI and $ε$-relaxation of PI. We highlight a relation between nonlocality certification under PI relaxation and that under detection inefficiencies by pointing out alternative extremal correlations to the Eberhard correlations that also allow to achieve detection efficiency of $η= 2/3$ in the two-input scenario. Finally, we study the implication of the relaxed assumptions for device-independent randomness certification. We analytically derive the quantum guessing probability for one player's outcomes in the CHSH Bell test, as a function of the noise in the test as well as of a leakage of an average amount of $I(X:B) < 1$ bits of input information per measurement round.

Abstract: Photonic multidimensional quantum networks (MDQN), where individual subsystems are encoded using multiple degrees of freedom and photons, are an emerging platform for quantum algorithms because they offer high scalability. The distribution of non-classical and non-local correlations between the individual subsystems in an MDQN is of fundamental interest for many quantum protocols. Interestingly in an MDQN, the inseparability of two subsystems underlying entanglement can occur both between multiple distinct photons as well as between individual degrees of freedom associated with a single photon. In this work, we investigate the entanglement transfer enabled by the interplay of both entanglement between two distinct photons as well as inseparability between multiple degrees of freedom. For this purpose, we subject one photon of a polarization entangled two-photon pair to a discrete-time quantum walk introducing the position subsystem of the quantum walk as a third subsystem with qudit encoding. Here we study the resulting transfer of entanglement from the polarization degree of freedom, representing qubit encoding, towards the position degree of freedom, representing quidt encoding, via partial state tomography and correlation measurements.

Method: 通过构建U-QRAM模型，分析访问受限场景下的信息提取能力。

Result: 读取受限会导致信息损失，影响任务性能。

Conclusion: 无记忆访问限制了量子计算的能力，未来需开发新型算法以规避此限制。

Abstract: Universal QRAM (U-QRAM) is a fixed, data-independent unitary interface that implements coherent random-access reads relative to a designated computational "truth-table" basis on the memory register. This work studies restricted-access inference: the memory register is persistent but inaccessible, while an experimenter may prepare and measure only accessible registers and may invoke the fixed read interaction.
  Allowing the memory to be in an arbitrary quantum state (pure or mixed, possibly entangled with an inaccessible reference system, or a coherent superposition of truth tables), we establish a sharp, protocol-independent limitation of read-only access. For any finite-query protocol -- including arbitrary accessible ancillas, intermediate measurements, adaptivity, and general CPTP processing between queries -- the induced output state on the accessible registers depends on the memory state only through its diagonal in the truth-table basis. Equivalently, read-only access factors through dephasing (pinching) in that basis; coherences between distinct truth tables are operationally invisible.
  Consequently, every memory-hypothesis testing task reduces to a standard state-discrimination problem on the accessible registers, and the minimum-error optimal measurement is characterized by Helstrom theory. We illustrate the framework with three explicit examples: (i) the phase-kickback reduction recovering the one-query Bernstein-Vazirani/Deutsch-Jozsa geometry, (ii) a minimal Helstrom instance with optimal success probability 3/4, and (iii) perfect indistinguishability of relative phases in entangled truth-table superpositions.

Abstract: We present an analytical method to solve de Broglie Bohm equation for the wave function by combining concepts from the Hamilton Jacobi equations of mechanics, continuity equations, and information theory. From a statistical point of view, the probabilistic description of particle motion provides a middle ground for transitioning from classical to quantum mechanics. An action functional obtained by coupling a Fisher information term produces a parametrically equivalent form of the de Broglie Bohm dBB equations. Next, we show that generalized Euler Lagrange equations can provide analytical solutions of dBB equations for certain simple stationary systems. One- and two-dimensional examples are provided to illustrate the similarities and differences between regular QM and the wave functions obtained from our generalization. To retain the generality of the method, we do not use hbar apriori but instead introduce a parametric information-error coupling term, mu. Our emphasis is strictly limited to the regularization method and its implications for energy states. We defer formal interpretations of the foundational aspects of this subject to a separate communication.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) leverages the natural dynamics of quantum systems for information processing, without requiring a fault-tolerant quantum computer. In this work, we apply QRC within a hybrid quantum classical framework for image denoising. The quantum reservoir is implemented using a Rydberg atom array, while a classical neural network serves as the readout layer. To prepare the input, images are first compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing their dimensionality to match the size of the atom array. Each feature vector is encoded into local detuning parameters of a time-dependent Hamiltonian governing the Rydberg system. As the system evolves, it generates nonlinear embeddings through the measurement of observables across multiple time steps. These temporal embeddings capture complex correlations, which are fed into a classical neural network to reconstruct the denoised images. To evaluate performance, we compare this QRC-assisted model against a baseline architecture consisting of PCA followed by a dense neural network, trained under identical conditions. Our results show that the QRC-based approach achieves improved image sharpness and similar structural recovery compared to the PCA-based model. We demonstrate the practical viability of this framework through experiments on QuEra's Aquila neutral-atom processor, leveraging its programmable atom arrays to physically realize the reservoir dynamics.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hidden quantum Markov models (HQMMs) framework to the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) state-a cornerstone example of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. The model's observation system is the physical spin-1 chain, which emerges from a hidden spin-1/2 layer through well-defined quantum emission operation. We show that the underlying Markov dynamics caputure maximal entanglement through the use of significant channels relevant to the AKLT state. We also show that SPT order induces a covariance on the observation decoding channels. This establishes an additional bridge between the quantum Machine learning and many-body physics, with promising implication in topological order and quantum information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing faces significant challenges from noise, and developing accurate noise models is critical for effective quantum software engineering.

Method: Utilized shadow tomography techniques combined with resource-efficient methods to develop SimShadow for noise characterization.

Result: Experiments demonstrated that SimShadow achieves Frobenius distances up to 7.39 while costing significantly less than traditional methods, enabling more efficient noise characterization.

Conclusion: New framework for noise characterization supports improved compilation, transpilation, validation, and error mitigation in quantum computing.

Abstract: Noise is a major bottleneck in today's quantum computing, stemming from decoherence, gate imperfections and other hardware limitations. Accurate noise fingerprints are essential, yet undocumented noise model differences between Quantum Ecosystems undermine core functionality, such as compilation, development and debugging, offering limited transferability and support for quantum software engineering (QSE) tasks. We propose a new research direction: live empirical noise fingerprinting as a lightweight QSE-oriented "noise fingerprinting". Though explored in physics as device-level diagnostics, we reposition them as a QSE paradigm: we propose leveraging classical shadow tomography to enable a new generation of techniques. As a first step, we introduce SimShadow, which prepares reference states, applies shadow-tomography-inspired estimation and constructs deviation fingerprints. Initial experiments uncover systematic discrepancies between platforms (e.g. Frobenius distances up to 7.39) at up to 2.5x10^6 lower cost than traditional methods. SimShadow opens new directions for noise-aware compilation, transpilation, cross-platform validation, error mitigation, and formal methods in QSE.

*Yuan Ji-Bing,Song Ya-Ju,Tang Shi-Qing,Wang Xin-Wen,Kuang Le-Man*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the quantum sensing performance of a dephasing qubit in Ohmic environments. The key findings are that the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (Q) peaks at an optimal time, with sensitivity dependent on parameters η, s, and temperature T. At zero temperature, Qmax is 0.648, while at high temperatures, it drops to Qmax/4. Importantly, increasing temperature can significantly enhance Qopt by nearly two orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensing is a rapidly growing field with potential applications in precision measurements across various domains. This paper contributes to understanding the fundamental limits and potential optimizations of qubit-based sensing in Ohmic environments.

Method: The authors derive the quantum Fisher information and use it to compute the quantum signal-to-noise ratio Q. They analyze the dependence of Q on η, s, and T by solving the equations of motion for the qubit and performing numerical simulations.

Result: The study reveals that the quantum sensing performance is sensitive to the environment's parameters. Specifically, Q increases with η and s but decreases with temperature. A key finding is that temperature can be used to enhance sensing precision by up to two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive analysis of qubit-based quantum sensing in Ohmic environments and demonstrates the role of temperature in enhancing sensing precision. The results offer valuable insights for optimizing quantum sensors in practical applications.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum sensing performance of a dephasing qubit as a probe in Ohmic environments, characterized by the coupling strength $η$, the Ohmicity parameter $s$, and the cutoff frequency $ω_c$ to be estimated. The performance is quantified by the dimensionless quantum signal-to-noise ratio $\mathcal{Q}$. We show that the evolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ with the scaled time $ω_c t$ is independent of $ω_c$, and peaks at an optimal time $t_{\text{opt}}$, yielding optimal sensitivity $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{opt}}$. We analyze how $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{opt}}$ depends on $η$, $s$ and the temperature $T$. Our results demonstrate that, for any Ohmic environment, provided that $ω_c t_{\text{opt}} \ll 1$, $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{opt}}$ always reaches the upper bound: $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{max}} = 0.648$ at zero temperature, and consistently attains $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{max}}/4$ at high temperatures. Remarkably, we find that increasing the scaled temperature $T/ω_c$ can enhance $\mathcal{Q}_{\text{opt}}$ by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to its zero-temperature counterpart for certain Ohmic environments. Our work reveals that temperature can serve as a resource to enhance sensing precision, as it accelerates the encoding of the cutoff frequency information into the probe state, thereby enabling optimal measurement within a short time window.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding whether quantum systems influenced by gravity can signal faster-than-light information is crucial for reconciling quantum mechanics with relativity.

Method: Used rigorous formalism of probability measures on spacetime and quantified the likelihood of superluminal bit transfer via the Schrödinger-Newton equation for a single particle.

Result: The probability of superluminal signaling decreases with the system's size and mass. The Einstein-Dirac system is fully compatible with relativistic causality.

Conclusion: The Schrödinger-Newton equation is more compatible with the no-signalling principle than the ordinary free Schrödinger equation, indicating a subtle interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity in maintaining relativistic consistency.

Abstract: The Schrödinger-Newton equation aims at describing the dynamics of massive quantum systems subject to the gravitational self-interaction. As a deterministic nonlinear quantum wave equation, it is generally believed to conflict with the relativistic no-signalling principle. Here we challenge this viewpoint and show that it is of key importance to study the quantitative and operational character of the superluminal effects. To this end we employ a rigorous formalism of probability measures on spacetime and quantify the probability of a successful superluminal bit transfer via the single-particle Schrödinger-Newton equation. We demonstrate that such a quantity decreases with the increasing size and mass of the system. Furthermore, we prove that the Einstein-Dirac system, which yields the Schrödinger-Newton equation in the non-relativistic limit, is perfectly compatible with the relativistic causal structure. Our study demonstrates that the Schrödinger-Newton equation, which is by construction non-relativistic, is in fact `more compatible' with the no-signalling principle than the ordinary free Schrödinger equation.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators promise access to complex many-body dynamics, yet their performance is ultimately set by how device imperfections compete with intrinsic physical mechanisms. Here we present an end-to-end study of correlation spreading in a programmable Rydberg-atom chain realizing a longitudinal-field transverse-field Ising model, focusing on the joint impact of confinement and effective disorder. Experiments performed on QuEra's Aquila quantum processor are benchmarked against large-scale coherent emulations using the Juelich Quantum Annealing Simulator (JUQAS), enabling the controlled inclusion of realistic hardware imperfections. In the ideal coherent limit, a tunable longitudinal field induces confinement of domain-wall excitations into mesonic bound states, leading to a progressive truncation of the correlation light cone. When experimentally relevant inhomogeneities and fluctuations are included, correlations instead saturate at finite distance even in the nominally deconfined regime, revealing localization driven by emergent disorder. The close quantitative agreement between noisy emulations and experimental data allows us to attribute the observed saturation to specific hardware error channels and to identify the dominant contribution. Our results establish a practical framework for diagnosing and modeling error-induced localization in Rydberg quantum processors, while demonstrating that confinement remains a robust and programmable mechanism for engineering non-ergodic dynamics on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: We define the perspective of any quantum reference frame (QRF) and construct reversible transformations between different perspectives. This extends the framework of [arXiv:2110.13199] to non-ideal QRFs with finite resources such as energy or angular momentum. We derive a QRF's perspective starting from two physically motivated principles, leading to an incoherent group averaging approach. The perspective of a non-ideal QRF deviates significantly from that of a more intuitive ideal frame with infinite resources: Firstly, systems described relative to the QRF appear superselected. Secondly, the structure of the QRF perspective attests that successive operations on a system relative to the QRF leads to back-reaction onto the QRF due to its non-ideality.

Abstract: Fiber-based classical communication is all-optical and uses light pulses reamplified and reshaped every 50-100 km in classical repeaters. Most compatible with this would be a quantum communication system which is also all-optical with quantum processing units placed in similar intervals. However, existing all-optical quantum communication protocols either require complicated quantum error correction steps for logical-qubit recoveries at every few kilometers or, over larger quantum repeater segments, they would at least depend on sharing complex multi-photon entangled states. Here we propose an all-optical memory-based quantum repeater for long-distance quantum communication, with quantum memories at each repeater station realized in the form of fiber loops combined with suitable quantum error correction codes for photon-loss protection. By sending only single-photon states through the fibers connecting the stations, such repeaters can operate in the classical infrastructure's long-segment regime. We analyze the performance of our scheme for the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code, including a concatenation with the Steane code, as well as the single-photon quantum parity code for total distances up to 10000 km.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Irreversibility implies a preferred flow of time, yet special relativity denies the existence of a preferred clock. This tension has long obstructed the formulation of a relativistic master equation: standard Markovian approximations either break Lorentz covariance, trigger catastrophic vacuum heating, or depend arbitrarily on the observer's foliation. In this work, we derive a Lorentz-invariant description of irreversibility for quantum fields. We take an approach that explicitly models the measurements required to observe irreversible dynamics. Instead of evolving the system along an abstract geometric time parameter, we anchor the dynamics to a physical, relational scalar clock field. Using a relational Tomonaga-Schwinger framework, we derive a local, non-Markovian master equation that is manifestly covariant and completely positive. We show that the finite resolution of the physical clock acts as a covariant regulator, preventing the vacuum instability that plagues white-noise models. This framework demonstrates that a consistent relativistic theory of decay exists, provided the reference frame is treated as a dynamical quantum resource rather than a gauge choice. In a gravitating context, the resulting dynamics is described by a hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) evolution that remains completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: By controlling chaos in quantum systems, it is possible to achieve optimal entanglement or coherence depending on the chaotic regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling quantum resources like entanglement and coherence is essential for quantum computing and information.

Method: The researchers used quantum-chaos models and techniques like wave-chaotic billiards and tilted-field Ising chains to investigate these resources.

Result: Avoided crossings in chaos lead to peak entanglement or coherence, and these can be observed in both single and many-body systems, enabling switchable resource modes.

Conclusion: By manipulating the level of chaos, one can optimize for either entanglement or coherence, offering a new approach to quantum resource management.

Abstract: Controlling entanglement and coherence is central to quantum information, yet the two resources often exhibit antagonistic trends and are difficult to optimize within a single platform. Here we show that chaos enables switchable eigenstate resources: avoided crossings in soft- versus strong- chaos windows selectively realize an entanglement-peak mode or a coherence-peak mode within the same system. Crucially, this chaos-controlled inversion is not tied to a particular notion of subsystems, appearing both in single-wave settings and in genuine many-body settings. From the quantum-chaos perspective, conventional diagnostics based on avoided-crossing phenomenology and eigenmode delocalization are insufficient; eigenfunction entanglement and basis coherence provide the missing discriminants. Using two wave-chaotic billiards and a tilted-field Ising chain, we track the information-theoretic response of eigenstates across localized hybridization windows. Even when avoided-crossing phenomenology and delocalization are comparable, the entanglement and coherence responses invert between soft- and strong-chaos regimes. In the Ising chain, a single microscopic knob, the global field tilt, toggles between the two operating modes and reveals a trade-off in which off-diagonal correlations grow as diagonal populations dip. Our diagnostics require only reduced states (or their spectra) and are compatible with mode imaging in wave-chaos resonators and randomized measurements in programmable spin simulators.

Abstract: Noisy monitored quantum circuits have emerged as a versatile and unifying framework connecting quantum many-body physics, quantum information, and quantum computation. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in understanding the dynamics of such circuits, with an emphasis on their entanglement structure, information-protection capabilities, and noise-induced phase transitions. A central theme is the mapping to classical statistical models, which reveals how quantum noise reshapes dominant spin configurations. This framework elucidates universal scaling behaviors, including the characteristic $q^{-1/3}$ entanglement scaling with noise probability $q$ and distinct timescales for information protection. We further highlight a broad range of constructions and applications inspired by noisy monitored circuits, spanning variational quantum algorithms, classical simulation methods, mixed-state phases of matter, and emerging approaches to quantum error mitigation and quantum error correction. These developments collectively establish noisy monitored circuits as a powerful platform for probing and controlling quantum dynamics in realistic, decohering environments.

Abstract: Chirality is more than a geometric curiosity; it governs measurable asymmetries across nature, from enantiomer-selective drugs and left-handed fermions in particle physics to handed charge transport in Weyl semimetals. We extend this universal concept to non-Hermitian systems by defining topological chirality, an invariant that emerges whenever an exceptional-points (EP) pair is present. Built from the non-commutative fundamental group and its braid representation, topological chirality acts as a singularity selector: clockwise EP loops occupy a homotopy class that avoids EPs, whereas counter-clockwise mirrors are equivalent only if they cross the EPs themselves. We confirm this binary rule in an optical microcavity and a non-Hermitian topological band. The same two-sheeted topology governs EP pairs in spin systems, photonic crystals and hybrid light-matter structures, where EP encirclements have already been demonstrated, so the framework transfers without alteration and confirms its experimental viability. Our findings lay the cornerstone for interpreting loop-sensitive observables such as spectral vorticity, the complex Berry phase and the non-Abelian holonomy. Finally, a gluing-of-planes construction extends the invariant to an n-sheeted surface hosting 2m EPs, unifying higher-order EP pairs.

Abstract: Machine learning methods have been used to infer specific properties of limited families of optical quantum states, but a unified model that predicts a broad range of properties for practically relevant-especially multimode non-Gaussian-states without full tomography is still lacking. Here we introduce the first foundation model for the characterization of optical quantum states across a wide range of complexity, defined by three key factors: non-Gaussianity, number of modes, and degree of squeezing. We show that a single model pretrained on low-complexity states can be directly applied to characterize states of higher complexity. With limited fine-tuning, the model adapts to downstream tasks such as predicting quantum fidelity and Wigner negativity over a broad class of experimentally relevant states, including strongly non-Gaussian Schrödinger cat states, multimode systems with up to ten modes, and highly squeezed states with squeezing levels up to 10.4dB. Our results establish a unified framework for characterizing optical quantum states from limited measurement data, enabling efficient certification of quantum states relevant to optical quantum information computation, communication and metrology.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is an important resource in many modern technologies, like quantum computation or quantum communication and information processing. Therefore, most interest is given to detect and quantify entangled states. Entanglement degree of bipartite mixed quantum states can be quantified using the Schmidt number. Witnesses of the Schmidt numbers are closely related to $k$-positive linear maps, for which there is no general construction. Here, we use the generalized equiangular measurements to define a family of $k$-positive maps and the corresponding Schmidt number witnesses.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics has become a fundamental framework for understanding open systems where gain and loss play essential roles, with impact across photonics, quantum science, and condensed matter. While the role of complex eigenvalues is well established, the nature of the corresponding eigenfunctions has remained a long-standing problem. Here we show that it arises from a fundamental entropic uncertainty trade-off between phase entropy and its Fourier representation. This trade-off enforces a correlated behavior of phase and Fourier entropies near avoided crossings and exceptional points, precisely where the Petermann factor diverges and phase rigidity collapses. Our results establish biorthogonality is not as an anomaly but an intrinsic property of eigenfunctions, arising universal manifestation of uncertainty relation in non-Hermitian systems. Beyond resolving this foundational question, our framework provides a unifying and testable principle that advances the fundamentals of non-Hermitian physics and can be directly verified with existing interferometric techniques.

Abstract: We investigate the genuinely quantum features of continuous-time quantum walks by combining a single-time and a multi-time quantifier of nonclassicality. On the one hand, we consider the quantum-classical dynamical distance $D_{\mathrm{QC}}(t)$, which measures the departure of the time-evolved quantum state of a continuous-time quantum walk from the classical state of a random walk on the same graph. On the other, we analyse the joint probability distributions associated with sequential measurements of the walker's position, assessing their violation of the classical Kolmogorov consistency conditions via a dedicated quantifier $\bar{K}(t)$. We demonstrate a quadratic short-time scaling of $\bar{K}(t)$, which differs from the known linear scaling of $D_{\mathrm{QC}}(t)$, but, as the latter, is fully determined by the degree of the initially occupied node and is independent of the global graph topology. At longer times, instead, $\bar{K}(t)$ exhibits a pronounced topology-driven behavior: it is strongly suppressed on complete graphs while remaining finite and oscillatory on cycles, in contrast with the almost topology-independent asymptotics of $D_{\mathrm{QC}}(t)$. We then extend the analysis to Markovian open-system dynamics, focusing on dephasing in the position basis (Haken-Strobl model) and in the energy basis (intrinsic decoherence). Site dephasing drives both quantifiers to zero, with the decay of $\bar{K}(t)$ controlled by the spectral gap of the corresponding Lindblad generator. By contrast, energy-basis dephasing preserves a finite asymptotic value of $\bar{K}(t)$, depending on the overlap structure of the Laplacian eigenspaces with the site basis.

### [173] [Structure-Preserving Optimal Control of Open Quantum Systems via a Discrete Contact PMP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18879)
*Leonardo Colombo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel framework for optimal control of dissipative quantum systems, specifically qubits, using a discrete Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) and a contact Lie-group variational integrator (contact LGVI). This method preserves the CPTP structure of Lindblad dynamics and the contact geometry, ensuring accurate and stable optimal control trajectories. It outperforms a conventional RK2 discretization by maintaining geometric faithfulness and physical consistency over long horizons or under strong dissipation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This work is driven by the need for robust and accurate optimal control methods in quantum systems, particularly in the context of open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. Ensuring the preservation of essential mathematical and physical structures is crucial for reliable control in practical applications.

Method: The authors developed a discrete variational integrator that respects the contact geometric structure of the Lindblad equation and the CPTP structure of the system's dynamics. They introduced a type-II discrete contact generating function that produces a strict discrete contactomorphism, ensuring precise propagation of states, costates, and cumulative costs.

Result: The proposed method, termed the contact LGVI, is shown to preserve the CPTP structure and contact geometry at each step of the discretization. This results in stable, physically consistent, and geometrically faithful optimal control trajectories. When compared to a conventional RK2 discretization, the contact LGVI outperforms it, especially under conditions of strong dissipation or extended control horizons.

Conclusion: The research successfully integrates geometric methods with optimal control theory for open quantum systems. The proposed framework addresses key limitations of conventional numerical methods by preserving the underlying geometric and algebraic structures, offering a powerful tool for the control of dissipative quantum systems.

Abstract: We develop a discrete Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) for controlled open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics, and introduce a second--order \emph{contact Lie--group variational integrator} (contact LGVI) that preserves both the CPTP (completely positive and trace--preserving) structure of the Lindblad flow and the contact geometry underlying the discrete PMP. A type--II discrete contact generating function produces a strict discrete contactomorphism under which the state, costate, and cost propagate in exact agreement with the variational structure of the discrete contact PMP.
  We apply this framework to the optimal control of a dissipative qubit and compare it with a non--geometric explicit RK2 discretization of the Lindblad equation. Although both schemes have the same formal order, the RK2 method accumulates geometric drift (loss of trace, positivity violations, and breakdown of the discrete contact form) that destabilizes PMP shooting iterations, especially under strong dissipation or long horizons. In contrast, the contact LGVI maintains exact CPTP structure and discrete contact geometry step by step, yielding stable, physically consistent, and geometrically faithful optimal control trajectories.

Conclusion: 未能完成一个详细的小三阶矩阵上的KS 映射完整分类，仍留下数值分析和更深入结构分析的空白。

Abstract: Kadison--Schwarz (KS) maps form a natural class of positive linear maps lying between positivity and complete positivity. Despite their relevance in quantum dynamics and operator algebras, a detailed characterization of KS maps beyond low dimensions remains largely open. In this work we analyze unital linear maps on $M_3$ using the Bloch--Gell--Mann representation. Exploiting unitary equivalence and structural properties of the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra, we derive analytic conditions ensuring the Kadison--Schwarz property. Our approach clarifies the relation between KS maps and completely positive maps on $M_3$.

Abstract: The Dirac oscillator is a relativistic quantum system, characterized by its linearity in both position and momentum. Moreover, considering $(1{+}1)$ and $(2{+}1)$ dimensions, the system can be mapped onto the Jaynes-Cummings and anti-Jaynes-Cummings models, as illustrated in an exact manner by Bermudez \emph{et al.} [\href{ https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.041801}{Phys. Rev. A 76, 041801(R)}]. Using the optical counterparts of the Dirac oscillator, we analyze an extension of the model that incorporates a time-dependent frequency. We focus on the consequences of these time modulations on the angular momentum observables and spin-orbit entanglement. Noticeable changes in the \emph{Zitterbewegung} are found. We show that a specific choice of time dependence yields aperiodic evolution of the observables, whereas an alternative choice allows analytical solutions.

Abstract: An approach for analysis of effective interaction between pre- and postselected quantum particles is developed. It is argued that the cases of complete pre- and postselection of particles are more profound than the cases of partial pre- and postselection, since the former goes beyond modification of the average of interactions on an ensemble of experiments. Recently discussed paradoxical phenomena such as the pigeonhole paradox and the modification of the interaction from repulsion to attraction are analyzed within the introduced formalism, and a few new surprising examples are presented.

Motivation: The paper focuses on understanding the fundamental bounds of quantum correlation functions and their implications for topological phases and thermal equilibrium.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust framework for probing intrinsic quantum timescales and establishes new connections between geometry and thermal properties of quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate fundamental bounds on the curvature of quantum correlation functions in imaginary time. Focusing first on topological phases, we show that quantum geometry can qualitatively modify the imaginary-time decay of correlations, leading to nontrivial curvature behavior beyond simple exponential scaling. More generally, we show a universal bound on correlation curvature that holds for interacting systems in thermal equilibrium, and establish connection to leading invariants of the memory-function formalism. Our results identify imaginary-time curvature as a robust probe of intrinsic quantum timescales.

Result: The authors show that photonic systems can effectively implement VQE, leveraging their features like room temperature operation and low decoherence for scalable quantum computation.

Conclusion: This work suggests that photonic systems are well-suited for implementing VQE, advancing practical quantum computing applications in quantum chemistry and physics.

Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to deliver speed-ups for solving certain important problems that are intractable for classical counterparts, making them a promising avenue for advancing modern computation. However, many quantum algorithms require deep quantum circuits, which are challenging to implement on current noisy devices. To address this limitation, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have been actively developed, enabling practical quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. Among them, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) stands out as a leading approach for solving problems in quantum chemistry, many-body physics, and even integer factorization. The VQE algorithm can be implemented on various quantum hardware platforms, including photonic systems, quantum dots, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and superconducting circuits. In particular, photonic platforms offer several advantages: they operate at room temperature, exhibit low decoherence, and support multiple degrees of freedom, making them suitable for scalable, high-dimensional quantum computation. Here we present methodologies for realizing VQE on photonic systems, highlighting their potential for practical quantum computing. We first provide a theoretical overview of the VQE framework, focusing on the procedure for variationally estimating ground state energies. We then explore how photonic systems can implement these processes, showing that a wide variety of problems can be addressed using either multiple qubit states or a single qudit state.

Motivation: The increasing demand for secure and reliable quantum-communication-based sensing systems in critical infrastructure necessitates this integrated approach to enhance functionality and fault detection.

Method: The study integrates QKD technology with fiber-optic sensing using weak measurement and disturbance localization methods on a Sagnac loop. It combines communication and sensing functionalities for comprehensive security monitoring.

Result: The SLIS achieves a raw key generation rate of 22.4 kbps, demonstrates scalable network expansion potential, and exhibits accurate disturbance detection for both dynamic (100 Hz resolution) and quasi-static (100 g) disturbances through slamming alignment and NFL techniques.

Conclusion: This integrated system paves the way for robust, self-diagnosable quantum networks, addressing critical security challenges in information infrastructure.

Abstract: The deep integration of quantum communication and fiber-optic sensing is pivotal for the development of next-generation multifunctional and highly reliable secure information infrastructure. Here, we present a Sagnac-loop integrated system (SLIS) that, for the first time, combines ring-based quantum key distribution (QKD) with fiber-based weak measurement (WM) enhanced sensing and disturbance localization capabilities. In the event of communication interruption due to external disturbances, the SLIS seamlessly switches to perception system, employing interference measurement and WM techniques to monitor channel disturbances. By integrating null-frequencies localization (NFL) mode, the system precisely determines the disturbance location, enabling rapid identification of security vulnerabilities along the link. Experimental results demonstrate that, over a 30 km Sagnac loop channel, the SLIS achieves a raw key generation rate of 22.4 kbps with stable operation and clear scalability toward network expansion. In terms of perception performance, the SLIS exhibits strong capability for both dynamic and quasi-static disturbances. For dynamic perturbations, the system detects transient impacts and PZT-driven frequency variations down to 100 Hz, and enables long-distance localization via NFL alignment, with improved localization performance as the disturbance position moves farther away along the loop. For quasi-static disturbances, gravitational changes as small as 100 g are resolved, corresponding to a time-delay variation of 9.81 as. This work provides a novel technical pathway toward self-diagnosing, robust quantum networks through integrated communication and sensing functionalities.

Abstract: Computing topological invariants of 3-manifolds is generally intractable, yet specialized algebraic structures can enable efficient algorithms. For Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants of torus bundles, we exploit the non-commutative torus structure to embed the skein algebra of the closed torus into its symmetric subalgebra at roots of unity. This yields a fixed $N^2$-dimensional representation that supports polynomial-time classical computation with $O(N^2)$ space, and a quantum algorithm using only $O(\log N)$ qubits -- an exponential space advantage. We further prove that extracting individual expansion coefficients is #P-complete, yet there is a quantum algorithm that can efficiently approximate these coefficients for a non-negligible fraction of configurations.

Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry with entangled photons exhibits distinctive quantum features. By introducing frequency entanglement (discrete-color entangled states) into HOM interference, the characteristic HOM dip is modulated by sinusoidal fringes, which significantly enhance the sensitivity of HOM sensors. The frequency-entangled photon sources demonstrated to date rely on non-resonant parametric down-conversion (PDC), which limits the photon coherence length and, consequently, restricts the sensing dynamic range to the sub-millimeter scale. In this work, we demonstrate narrowband frequency-entangled photon source based on resonant PDC in a crystalline whispering gallery mode resonator. The MHz-level spectral bandwidth of photons enables a meter-scale dynamic range. With highly nondegenerate frequency-entangled photon pairs featuring a 96 THz frequency detuning, we observe high-contrast quantum beating with sub-picosecond resolution in the HOM experiment. Our WGMR-based frequency-entangled photon source has potential applications in quantum metrology and quantum information processing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian-based quantum state preparation method implemented via a shallow parametrized quantum circuit. The approach learns the parameters of a diagonal Hamiltonian through a classical training phase, while the quantum circuit itself performs only fixed-depth Hamiltonian evolution and mixing operations. With oracle access to the learned Hamiltonian parameters, $N$ classical data values can be encoded into $n=\log_2{N}$ qubits using $O(1)$ quantum queries, shifting the overall computational cost to an $O(N\log{N})$ classical preprocessing stage. For structured datasets generated by an underlying function, oracle access can be avoided by expressing the Hamiltonian in the Walsh basis and retaining only a polynomial number of significant terms. In this regime, quantum state preparation is achieved in $\text{poly}(n)$ time using $\text{poly}(n)$ parameters, reaching infidelities on the order of $10^{-5}$. By restricting the Hamiltonian to one-local and two-local terms, the method naturally yields hardware-efficient circuits suitable for near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: We develop a linear-programming method to extract dynamical information from static ground-state correlators in quantum field theory. We recast the Källén-Lehmann inversion as a convex optimization problem, in a spirit similar to the recent approach of Lawrence [arXiv:2408.11766]. This produces robust estimates of the smeared spectral density, the real-time propagator, and the mass gap directly from an approximate equal-time two-point function, and simultaneously yields an \emph{a posteriori} lower bound on the correlation-function error. We test the method on the $1+1$-dimensional $φ^4$ model, using a variational approximation to the vacuum -- relativistic continuous matrix product states -- that provides accurate correlators in the continuum and thermodynamic limits. The resulting mass gaps agree with renormalized Hamiltonian truncation and Borel-resummed perturbation theory across a wide range of couplings, demonstrating that accurate dynamical data can be recovered from a single equal-time slice.

Abstract: We apply sonification strategies and quantum computing to the analysis of an episode of seizure. We first sonify the signal from a selection of channels (from real ECoG data), obtaining a polyphonic sequence. Then, we propose two quantum approaches to simulate a similar episode of seizure, and we sonify the results. The comparison of sonifications can give hints on similarities and discrepancies between real data and simulations, helping refine the \textit{in silico} model. This is a pioneering approach, showing how the combination of quantum computing and sonification can broaden the perspective of real-data investigation, and helping define a new test bench for analysis and prediction of seizures.

Abstract: Estimating energy gaps, i.e. the energy difference between two different states, in quantum systems is crucial for understanding their properties. Conventionally, spectral gap estimation relies on independently computing the ground-state and first-excited-state energies and then taking their difference. This work introduces an alternative procedure for estimating spectral gaps on digital quantum devices using the Adiabatic Preparation technique to create a specific superposition state. The expectation values of observables measured on such a state exhibit time-dependent fluctuations which, through a fitting process, can be used to estimate the energy gap. We successfully test our method on the 1D and 2D Ising models, and H2 and He2 molecules, implementing relatively shallow circuits both on noiseless and noisy simulators. The robustness of the approach is corroborated by additional experiments on the real IonQ Aria device for the 1D Ising model up to 20 qubits, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method for currently available digital quantum devices and paving the way for more complex energy gap calculation requiring deeper circuits in the fault-tolerant era to come.

Abstract: We study daily rolling stock circulation planning for electric multiple units (EMUs) on a regional passenger network, focusing on services where identical EMUs may be coupled in pairs on selected routes. Motivated by the operational needs of the regional operator Silesian Railways in Poland, we formulate an acyclic mixed-integer linear program on a one-day horizon that incorporates depot balance constraints, demand-driven seat and bicycle capacity limits (which is a new aspect requested by the regional operator and local society of passengers), and simple crew availability constraints. The model is designed to support both baseline planning and disruption management under increased passenger demand. Using a graph-hypergraph representation of trips and single or coupled EMU movements, we first solve the problem with a classical ILP solver. We then derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) reformulation - which is frequently used as the input for quantum optimization - and evaluate its solution by quantum annealing on D-Wave Advantage systems and by the classical quantum-inspired VeloxQ solver. Computational experiments on real-world instances from the Silesian network, with up to 404 train trips and 11 EMU types, show that the ILP approach can obtain high-quality daily circulation plans within at most about 40 minutes, whereas current quantum and quantum-inspired solvers are restricted to substantially smaller sub-instances (up to 51 and 78 train trips, respectively) due to embedding and QUBO size limitations. These results quantify the present frontier of QUBO-based methods for rolling stock circulation and point towards hybrid decision-support architectures in which quantum or quantum-inspired optimizers address only local subproblems within a broader classical planning framework.

Motivation: The authors aim to create benchmarks that can be used to quantitatively measure quantum hardware's capabilities in a way that's verifiable by classical computers and scalable across different platforms.

Method: The benchmarks are based on random Clifford and free fermion operations, which are classes of unitaries. The properties of these operations allow for scalability and verifiability, as they can be checked classically and together they form a universal gate set.

Result: The benchmarks pass verification through extensive numerical simulations and experimental validation on a trapped-ion quantum computer, achieving a Clifford Volume of 34.

Conclusion: These benchmarks provide a standardized, scalable way to benchmark quantum hardware that's independent of specific hardware features, enabling fair comparisons and tracking of quantum advancement.

Abstract: As quantum computing advances toward the late-NISQ and early fault-tolerant eras, scalable and platform-independent benchmarks are essential for quantifying computational capacity in a classically verifiable manner. We introduce two volumetric benchmarks, Clifford Volume and Free Fermion Volume, that assess quantum hardware by testing the execution of random Clifford and free fermion operations. These two groups of unitaries possess a combination of properties that make them ideal for benchmarking: (i) each is individually efficient to simulate classically, enabling verification at scale; (ii) together they form a universal gate set; (iii) they serve as essential algorithmic primitives in practical applications (including shadow tomography and quantum chemistry); and (iv) their definitions are formulated abstractly, without explicit reference to hardware-specific features such as qubit connectivity or native gate sets. This framework thus enables scalable and fair cross-platform comparisons and tracks meaningful computational advancement. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of these benchmarks through extensive numerical simulations across realistic noise parameters and through experimental validation on Quantinuum's H2-1 trapped-ion quantum computer, which achieves a Clifford Volume of 34.

Abstract: Predicting ground state energies of quantum many-body systems is one of the central computational challenges in quantum chemistry, physics, and materials science. Krylov subspace methods, such as Krylov Quantum Diagonalization and Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization, are promising approaches for this task on near-term quantum computers. However, both require repeated quantum circuit executions for each Krylov subspace and for every new Hamiltonian, posing a major bottleneck under noisy hardware constraints. We introduce Generative Krylov Subspace Representations (GenKSR), a framework that learns a classical generative representation of the entire Krylov diagonalization process. To enable effective modeling of quantum systems, GenKSR leverages a conditional generative model framework. We investigate two representative backbone architectures, the standard Transformer and the Mamba state-space model. By learning the distribution of measurement outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters and evolution time, GenKSR generates Krylov subspace samples for unseen Hamiltonians and for larger subspace dimensions than those used in training. This enables full energy reconstruction purely from the classical model, without additional quantum experiments. We validate our approach through simulations of 15-qubit 1D and 16-qubit 2D Heisenberg models, as well as a hardware experiment on a 20-qubit XXZ chain executed on an IBM quantum processor. Our model successfully learns the distribution from experimental data and generates a high-fidelity representation of the quantum process. This representation enables classical reproduction of experimental outcomes, supports reliable energy estimates for unseen Hamiltonians, and significantly reduces the need for further quantum computation.

Abstract: Motivated by a compelling need for time-efficient and robust schemes for quantum-state engineering in systems of neutral atoms in optical tweezers, we consider a ring-shaped array of qubits with nearest-neighbor Ising-type ($zz$) coupling and transverse ($x$ and $y$) global control fields. This system to a large extent mimics -- outside of the Rydberg-blockade regime -- a circular array of neutral atoms interacting through van-der-Waals type interaction. We investigate the preparation of $W$ and Dicke states in this system starting from the default initial state $|00\ldots 0\rangle$ using two different optimal-control approaches: (i) NMR-like pulse sequence, which consists of instantaneous (delta-shaped) control- and Ising-interaction pulses, and (ii) time-dependent control scheme, which entails shaped control pulses in the presence of always-on Ising interaction between adjacent qubits. By making use of the underlying dihedral symmetry of this system -- which allows one to use a symmetry-adapted computational basis with $\mathcal{O}(2^N / N)$ states in an $N$-qubit system -- and utilizing advanced global-optimization methods, we find optimal sequences of pulses for realizing $W$ and Dicke states within both approaches. In addition, we demonstrate robustness of these sequences against unavoidable control errors. Finally, using typical values of parameters in realistic Rydberg-atom systems, we show that our control schemes enable the preparation of the desired multiqubit states on time scales much shorter than the relevant coherence times of those systems.

Abstract: Matter qubits that maintain coherence over extended timescales are essential for many pursued applications in quantum communication and quantum computing. Significant progress has already been made on extending coherence times of spins in semiconductor quantum dots while interfacing them with photons in the near-infrared wavelength range. However, similar results for quantum dots emitting at the telecom range, crucial for many applications, have so far lagged behind. Here, we report on InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots integrated in a deterministically placed circular Bragg grating emitting at $1.55\,μ\mathrm{m}$. We quantify the g-factors of electrons and holes from polarization-resolved measurements of a positive trion in an in-plane magnetic field and study the dynamics of the ground-state hole spin qubit. We then herald the hole spin in a pulsed two-photon correlation measurement and determine its inhomogeneous dephasing time to $T_{2}^{*}=(15.9 \pm 1.7)$ ns.

Abstract: Hybrid qubit-qumode quantum computing platforms provide a natural setting for simulating interacting bosonic quantum field theories. However, existing continuous-variable gate constructions rely predominantly on polynomial functions of canonical quadratures. In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-like representation of bosonic operators and are particularly well suited for periodic and non-perturbative interactions. We present a deterministic ancilla-based method for implementing unitary and non-unitary trigonometric gates whose arguments are arbitrary Hermitian functions of qumode quadratures. As a concrete application, we develop a hybrid qubit-qumode quantum simulation of the lattice sine-Gordon model. Using these gates, we prepare ground states via quantum imaginary-time evolution, simulate real-time dynamics, compute time-dependent vertex two-point correlation functions, and extract quantum kink profiles under topological boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate that trigonometric continuous-variable gates provide a physically natural framework for simulating interacting field theories on near-term hybrid quantum hardware, while establishing a parallel route to universality beyond polynomial gate constructions. We expect that the trigonometric gates introduced here to find broader applications, including quantum simulations of condensed matter systems, quantum chemistry, and biological models.

Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling is an important protocol for testing the performance of photonic quantum simulators. As such, various noise sources have been investigated that degrade the operation of such devices. In this paper, we examine a situation with phase noise between different modes of the input state leading to dephasing of the system. This models the phase fluctuations which remain even when the mean phase is controlled. We aim to determine whether these phase-noisy input states still form a computationally difficult problem. To do this, we use Matrix Product Operators to model the system, a technique recently used to model boson sampling scenarios. Our investigation finds that the Entanglement entropy grows linearly with the number of input states even for noisy input states. This implies that, unlike boson loss, this form of experimentally relevant noise remains difficult to simulate with tensor networks and may allow for the demonstration of quantum advantage without the need for implementing the challenging task of input-state phase stabilisation.

Abstract: Accurate temperature estimation in the quantum and cryogenic regimes remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we investigate nonequilibrium quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe coupled to a bosonic bath through noncommuting interaction operators, which unify pure dephasing and dissipative dynamics within a spin-boson model. We show that the interference between these two coupling channels induces strong non-Markovian feedback between populations and coherences, leading to coherence trapping and enhanced thermal sensitivity. Remarkably, by tuning the coupling structure, the probe's temperature sensitivity exhibits a quadratic low-temperature scaling, even under weak coupling. Moreover, while coherence-based measurements are formally suboptimal, they become the most informative in the early nonequilibrium regime, where memory effects dominate. Our findings identify noncommutative system-bath couplings as a practical and tunable resource for achieving high-precision quantum thermometry in realistic open-system architectures.

Abstract: Quantum decoherence refers to the phenomenon when the interaction of a quantum system with its environment results in the degradation of quantum coherence. Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence results from the entanglement of a quantum system with certain environment degrees of freedom, and quantifying this entanglement should yield the most natural measure of decoherence. A simple measure of decoherence is presented based on this notion, and it is examined for various example systems. The measure proves to be effective and is relatively straightforward to compute. In addition, a method has been proposed to measure decoherence in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

Abstract: Circuit knitting is a family of techniques that enables large quantum computations on limited-size quantum devices by decomposing a target circuit into smaller subcircuits. However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quasiprobability decomposition (QPD), for example, rescaling factors lead to an exponential dependence on the number of cuts. In this work, we show that such an exponential scaling is not universal: it can be circumvented for tree-structured quantum circuits via concatenated quantum tomography protocols. We first consider estimating the expectation value of an observable within additive error $ε$ for a tree-structured circuit with tree depth 1 (two layers), maximum branching factor $R$, and bond dimension at most $d$ on each edge. Our approach uses quantum tomography to construct, for each cut edge, a local decomposition that eliminates the rescaling factors in conventional QPD, instead introducing a controllable bias set by the tomography sample size. After cutting $R$ edges, we show that $\mathcal{O}(d^3R^3\ln(dR)/ε^2)$ total measurements suffice, including tomography cost. Next, we extend the tree-depth-1 case to general trees of depth $L\geq2$, and give an algorithm whose total measurement cost $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3K^{5}/ε^2)$ scales polynomially with the number of cuts for complete $R$-ary trees. Finally, we perform an information-theoretic analysis to show that, in a comparable tree-depth-1 setting, conventional QPD-based wire-cutting methods require at least $Ω((d+1)^R/ε^2)$ measurements. This exponential separation highlights the significance of tomography-based construction for reducing measurement overhead in hybrid quantum-classical computations.

Abstract: As quantum processors continue to scale in size and complexity, the need for well-defined, reproducible, and technology-agnostic performance metrics becomes increasingly critical. Here we present a suite of scalable quantum computing benchmarks developed as key performance indicators (KPIs) within the EU Quantum Flagship. These proposed benchmarks are designed to assess holistic system performance rather than isolated components, and to remain applicable across both noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future fault-tolerant architectures. We introduce four core benchmarks addressing complementary aspects of quantum computing capability: large multi-qubit circuit execution via a Clifford Volume benchmark, scalable multipartite entanglement generation through GHZ-state preparation, a benchmark based on the application of Shor's period-finding subroutine to simple functions, and a protocol quantifying the benefit of quantum error correction using Bell states. Each benchmark is accompanied by clearly specified protocols, reporting standards, and scalable evaluation methods. Together, these KPIs provide a coherent framework for transparent and fair performance assessment across quantum hardware platforms and for tracking progress late-NISQ toward early fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: Magic states are essential resources enabling universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation within the stabilizer framework. Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \subset \mathrm{U}(\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and Rényi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer Rényi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols. We further propose an inefficient distillation protocol for a two-qubit magic state with stabilizer fidelity exceeding that of standard benchmark states.

### [200] [Partition Function Estimation Using Analog Quantum Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19685)
*Thinh Le,Elijah Pelofske*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates quantum annealing methods for Ising model partition functions, finding quantum methods can rival classical Monte Carlo in accuracy and efficiency, with notable super fast speeds achieving 0.2s QPU time per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of quantum computing for combinatorial optimization has shown promise in solving complex problems through quantum annealing, but to benchmark its effectiveness compared to classical methods, a study was conducted to assess the accuracy and efficiency of quantum annealing approaches in approximating the partition functions.

Method: The authors evaluated programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annelers by implementing two distinct sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. They characterized the quality of the simulations by the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and, for reverse annealing, the anneal-pause duration. The density of states estimation technique involved sampling the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian to approximate the partition function, providing a basis for thermodynamic quantity computation at any temperature.

Result: The study discovered parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that yield results comparable to standard classical Monte Carlo methods, specifically Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. On a 25-spin ±J hardware graph, native Ising models were evaluated, and the quantum methods showed comparable accuracy. Particularly on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU, there was a significant achievement with a logarithmic relative error of 7.6×10^-6, achieved from 171,000 samples generated in 0.2 seconds of QPU time with each sample taking 8 nanoseconds of anneal time. This achieved super fast speeds, even being comparable within the closed-system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.

Conclusion: The research conclusively demonstrates that quantum annealing methods can now achieve high accuracy in partition function approximation for Ising models, particularly with the Pegasus architecture. It opens new possibilities for applying quantum annealing in fields like sampling, low-temperature simulations, and partition function calculations, marking a significant step towards practical quantum computing applications for combinatorial optimization problems with quantum systems.

Abstract: We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits.

Abstract: Recent work by Engelhardt, Gesteau, and Harlow applies proposals for incorporating observers into holographic maps to study the Antonini-Rath puzzle for closed universes. In a new form of ``observer complementarity,'' they find that an AdS bulk observer measures a SWAP test to determine that there is no closed universe in the bulk, contrary to the (limited) description given by an observer inside the closed universe. In this work, we improve the predictions of both observers by using the holographic maps to define new operators to perform this same SWAP test. With these, we show that the AdS observer cannot rule out a baby universe in the bulk, and the closed universe observer can improve the accuracy of their description.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究中考虑型 IIB 弦理论在紧致化流形上的修正项对其势的影响，具体分析了 F 项的德西特上提作用。通过系统性的逆体积展开方法，在包含非 ISD 3-形式磁场的背景下，四维非壳层势被求得。该势是通过积分所有高模元得来的。引入一个带有逆体积修正的四维 N=1 超对称超引力 Kähler 势，并验证了其一致性。在 KKLT 框架下，发现经典的修正项以及其他涉及非 ISD 磁场和量子效应的修正项brace err 约占主导地位，从而使得整个机制难以预测和控制。而这种现象在类似于 LVS 的构造中则被慢化或消除，修正项的幅度被逆体积因子明显抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究型 IIB 理论在紧致化流形上的修正项，尤其是其对势能的影响，是一个可行但开放的问题。在 KKLT 框架下，此修正项的作用导致同一机制难以得到控制，为研究者提供了一个有趣的挑战。

Method: 采用系统的逆体积展开方法，首先在十维方程物理运动的基础上，求出了四维非壳层势，并引入了 Warping 改正项。随后给出了超引力 Kähler 势，并通过十维结果验证了其一致性。在比较 KKLT 和 LVS 构造时，发现在前者的修正项对势的影响较大，而在后者中这一影响较小。

Result: 研究结果表明，在型 IIB 理论的紧致化流形中，由于存在逆体积展开的 warped Kähler 势和修正的模数叠加效应，与 KKLT 框架下的显著修正不同，LVS 型构造中的修正会被抗 bg 分隔消除。这表明对于比率等关键参数的控制变得困难，均位收缩的世界需要更精细的分析。

Conclusion: 本文分析了型 IIB 理论中 warping 更正对势的影响，表明在 KKLT 框架上这一机制难以控制，在 LVS 型构造中则相对可控。这提供了不同构造中参数调节的关键信息，对设计和分析现有超对称解除模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: We analyse warping corrections to the scalar potential in flux compactifications of Type IIB string theory, focusing on their effect on $F$-term de Sitter uplifting in Calabi-Yau orientifold models. A systematic inverse-volume expansion allows us to derive the four-dimensional off-shell potential in the presence of warping and non-ISD 3-form fluxes. This corresponds to integrating out all massive Kaluza-Klein modes using the ten-dimensional equations of motion. We further propose a warped Kähler potential in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity, and show that it is consistent with our ten-dimensional results. In the KKLT framework, we find that classical warping corrections, as well as mixed corrections involving non-ISD fluxes and quantum effects, are dominant, rendering the scenario effectively uncontrollable with current methods. By contrast, in LVS-like constructions these corrections are suppressed by inverse powers of the volume, specifically $\mathcal{V}^{1/2}$ or $\mathcal{V}^{1/6}$, depending on the concrete model.

Conclusion: 引入非局部增长型函数可以消除一环发散，高斯-贝恩项和表面积分仍然是主要的贡献。这表明不一定需要用微分算子增长太快的情形，如某些超出Tomboulis类的函数也能实现消失发散。

Abstract: We consider the most general covariant gravity action up to terms that are quadratic in curvature. These can be endowed with generic form factors, which are functions of the d'Alembert operator. If they are chosen in a specific way as an exponent of an entire function, the theory becomes ghost-free and renormalizable at the price of non-locality. Furthermore, according to power-counting arguments, if these functions grow sufficiently fast along the real axis, divergences may only appear at the first order in loop expansion. Using the heat kernel technique, we compute the one-loop logarithmic divergences in the ultraviolet limit and determine the conditions under which they vanish completely, apart from the Gauss--Bonnet term and a surface term, both of which can be neglected on a four-dimensional manifold without a boundary. We identify form factors both within the Tomboulis class and beyond it that lead to vanishing logarithmic divergences. The general expression for the one-loop beta functions of the dimensionless couplings in quadratic gravity with asymptotically monomial form factors is given.

On curved backgrounds, we further construct the Weyl-invariant completion of the auxiliary field action with boundary terms and identify the corresponding conformal boundary conditions. Finally, we compute the boundary charges in the trace anomaly from the displacement operator correlators.

Abstract: We use holography to study dS-invariant states of non-conformal, strongly coupled quantum field theories in four-dimensional de Sitter space. We show that out-of-equilibrium effects can sustain the exponential inflation within the regime of validity of semiclassical gravity, $H \ll M \ll M_\mathrm{sp}$, with $H$ the Hubble parameter, $M$ the characteristic scale of the quantum field theory, $M_\mathrm{sp} = M_\mathrm{p}/N$ the species scale, $M_\mathrm{p}$ the Planck scale, and $N^2$ the number of matter fields. In the holographic description, the required fine-tuning scales only logarithmically with the ratio $M_\mathrm{sp}/H$. The resulting solutions exhibit apparent horizons whose increasing area indicates a continuous growth of the comoving entropy density. We suggest that this inflationary regime can arise as the late-time limit of a dynamical evolution starting from an initial Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker universe.

Abstract: In this work, we provide evidence for a duality between 4-dimensional Calabi-Yau compactifications of the heterotic string, in which the base manifolds are linked by a conifold transition. In recent work, a geometric proposal was put forward for how 5-branes and gauge bundles are carried across such transitions. It was observed that compactifications connected in this way lead to 4-dimensional effective theories with the same massless spectrum. Here we provide much stronger evidence that these heterotic conifold transitions do indeed lead to dual theories. We construct a duality map between the field spaces of the two compactifications and use it to demonstrate the agreement of large numbers of holomorphic functions appearing in the definition of the effective theories. In an example, we show that 147,440 independent superpotential Yukawa couplings agree across the duality as holomorphic functions of the moduli. In certain special cases, the putative duality studied here reduces to the target space duality of (0,2) gauged linear sigma models.

Abstract: F-theory compactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau threefolds yield consistent six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity theories, for which the cancellation of gravitational, gauge and mixed anomalies imposes non-trivial algebraic relations between classical intersection data and enumerative geometry invariants of curves in the fiber. In this work, we capture the spectrum of such theories via meromorphic quasi-Jacobi forms of index zero whose Fourier coefficients determine the genus zero Gromov--Witten theory restricted to curve classes in the fiber. We find that the one-loop anomaly coefficients of the effective six-dimensional theories are encoded in the modular properties of these automorphic forms, while the Green--Schwarz counterterms are made manifest by the Fourier--Mukai transform action on zero- and two-branes associated with double T-duality along the elliptic fiber. Moreover, we show that the anomaly cancellation conditions are automatically satisfied in this class of string compactifications as a consequence of the holomorphic anomaly equations of topological string theory.

Abstract: We revisit the question of whether Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) cosmic strings can admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) configurations. Earlier work by Babichev et al. arXiv:0809.2013 concluded that DBI strings with the standard Mexican-hat potential possess no BPS limit, implying an unavoidable nonzero binding energy. In contrast, using the BPS Lagrangian method, we show that DBI strings do admit BPS solutions, provided the potential is chosen self-consistently. Imposing the existence of Bogomol'nyi equations uniquely determines the admissible potential and yields exact first-order BPS equations for DBI vortices. We independently verify the consistency of these equations using the stressless (vanishing-pressure) condition on the energy-momentum tensor. The resulting solutions saturate the Bogomol'nyi bound, exhibit zero binding energy, and smoothly recover the Nielsen-Olesen string in the limit $α\to 0$. Regularity of the gauge-field equation requires $α< π^2$. A notable outcome of the construction is that the BPS-compatible potential takes a trigonometric form closely related to the sine-Gordon potential, revealing a natural correspondence between the sine-Gordon string and the BPS DBI string. The BPS tension scales linearly with the winding number $n$ but acquires an $α$-dependent deformation.

*Mrinmoy Basak*

TL;DR: Flow equations, also known as Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) techniques, have been developed to handle multiscale problems with multiple length or energy scales. This thesis formulates the flow equation method using a wavelet-based framework and applies it to study scale separation in a two-dimensional scalar field theory. The flow equations systematically block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian with respect to wavelet resolution, leading to improved truncation compared to earlier studies. A model with two real scalar fields interacting quadratically is used to demonstrate that flow equations suppress couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom, offering a clear mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics and insights into constructing effective Hamiltonians using wavelet-based flow equations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow equations, or Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) techniques, are traditional methods for addressing multiscale systems. Although they have been used for decades, their application to specific problems like scale separation in scalar field theories has been challenging. This thesis aims to enhance our understanding by formulating the flow equation method within a wavelet-based framework, which offers potential advancements in accurately handling scale separation.

Method: The thesis begins by introducing the concept of flow equations and their role in addressing multiscale problems. It then delves into the formulation of these flow equations within a wavelet-based framework. The specific setup involves a model with two real scalar fields interacting via a quadratic term. The analysis focuses on demonstrating how the flow equations systematically block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian with respect to wavelet resolution, leading to improved truncation. The methodology also includes applying these flow equations to demonstrate the suppression of couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom.

Result: The key findings include the successful application of wavelet-based flow equations to achieve scale separation in a two-dimensional scalar field theory. The analysis shows that the flow equations effectively suppress couplings between low- and high-resolution degrees of freedom, providing a clear mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics. Additionally, the improved truncation compared to earlier studies suggests enhanced accuracy in handling multiscale interactions.

Conclusion: This paper introduces the use of wavelet-based flow equations for addressing multiscale problems, particularly in separating scales in scalar field theories. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately suppressing cross-scale couplings and improving the truncation of the Hamiltonian. This not only offers a clearer mechanism for isolating low-resolution physics but also provides valuable insights into constructing effective Hamiltonians using wavelet-based flow equations, paving the way for future research in this area.

Motivation: The study of free energy and RG flow underpins understanding of quantum field theories, particularly in diverse dimensions and non-conformal settings. This work seeks to extend the boundary $F$-theorem, a key insight in conformal scenarios.

Method: The authors employ large $N$ expansion and boundary conformal field theory techniques, working within specific dimensions (notably 2D) where computations may be more tractable. They test the conjecture in distinct examples and provide a formal proof in 2D.

Result: In 2D, the conjecture is validated through both examples and a formal proof. The paper also leverages these findings to derive bounds on sphere free energies for Ising-type models in three dimensions.

Conclusion: The paper advances the understanding of free energy monotonicity in non-conformal AdS QFTs, offering proofs and applications that enhance our knowledge of related critical phenomena and phase transitions.

Abstract: We introduce a regularized free energy $\mathcal{F}_{\text{AdS}}$ for massive quantum field theories (QFTs) on Anti-de Sitter space (AdS). We conjecture this quantity to be monotonic under the renormalization group (RG) flow induced by boundary perturbations, generalizing the known boundary $F$-theorem to non-conformal setups. We test this conjecture in several examples and provide a proof in two dimensions. We also discuss applications to long-range critical points, obtaining bounds on the sphere free energy of long- and short-range Ising models in three dimensions.

Abstract: We introduce two novel numerical approaches for computing Feynman integrals based on their complete monotonicity (CM) and Stieltjes properties. The first method uses that scalar Feynman integrals are CM, meaning that all their derivatives have a fixed sign, in the Euclidean kinematic region. This imposes strong constraints on the function space. Simultaneously, these integrals obey systems of linear differential equations with respect to kinematic parameters. By imposing that the solutions to these differential equations satisfy complete monotonicity across the Euclidean region, we develop an efficient and highly constraining numerical bootstrap method. We provide a proof of principle of the power of our approach by applying it to a class of multi-loop Feynman integrals with internal masses. The second method is based on a refinement of CM. We prove that Feynman integrals, within a certain range of parameters, such as dimension and propagator exponents, are not only CM but in fact Stieltjes functions. The latter can be described efficiently by Padé approximants that are known to converge in the cut complex plane. This means that these representations are valid also in analytically continued kinematics, such as physical scattering regions. These insights allow us to obtain rational approximations to Feynman integrals from minimal information, such as a Taylor expansion about a soft limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to a 20-loop banana-type Feynman integral. Finally, we comment on a number of extensions of these novel avenues for computing Feynman integrals.

Abstract: We study the origin of modular weights of wave functions in magnetized $T^{2}$ models. It is explicitly demonstrated that the modular weights of the wave functions on magnetized $T^2$ is equivalent to their mass level. We further extend this result to magnetized $T^{2g}$ models. As a result, we construct the wave functions of excited states in magnetized $T^{2g}$ models and show that their modular weights are likewise equivalent to the corresponding mass levels.

Abstract: We construct a manifestly covariant and coordinate-free plane-wave representation of scalar two-point functions in $d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. The construction is based on a new class of holomorphic plane waves defined globally on the universal covering of the AdS via chiral cones in the complex null cone. Imposing AdS invariance, locality, positive definiteness and a spectral condition, we obtain integral representations as superpositions over relative homology cycles,
  reproducing the standard maximally analytic solutions in terms of Legendre functions of the second kind. In Poincaré coordinates, the two-point functions diagonalize into a Kallen-Lehmann superposition of (d-1)-dimensional Minkowski correlators where the weight is a product of Bessel functions. This diagonalization clarifies the relation between Euclidean and Lorentzian AdS quantum field theory and allows Wick rotation of Euclidean Feynman diagrams to Lorentzian integrals supported on a single Poincare patch while preserving full AdS covariance.

Abstract: We construct new families of non-toric 5d SCFTs via abelian orbifolds of the Reid Pagoda, including a surprising infinite family of rank-1 theories, that evade all known classifications. Using the McKay correspondence, we derive their BPS quivers and superpotentials. The hallmark of these theories is a novel sector we dub Pagoda matter, whose vacuum expectation values obstruct the Kaehler moduli. This mechanism freezes the gauge coupling to infinite value, precluding a weak-coupling limit and rendering the theories intrinsically strongly coupled. Finally, we interpret these results as 5d SCFTs deformed by non-constant flavor backgrounds.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the time evolution of entanglement entropy and mutual information for the spatially-infinite systems where we act with a primary operator on the vacuum state and then time-evolve it with the sequence of the Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions. Two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories describe the systems under consideration in this paper. The Euclidean time evolution is induced by the Rindler Hamiltonian and behaves as the regulator that tames the divergence induced by the local operator, while the Lorentzian one is induced by the uniform Hamiltonian. Under these time evolutions, we investigate the time ordering effect of the Rindler Euclidean and uniform Lorentzian time evolution operators. Consequently, we find the remarkable differences between those time evolutions are induced by whether those are unitary or non-unitary. Especially, we find that the unitary time evolution induces the late-time logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy, while the non-unitary time evolution induces the late-time constant behavior. Furthermore, we investigate the dual gravity of the systems under consideration. Especially, we investigate the gravity duals of the systems with the insertion of the heavy primary operator and show that it is a black brane with a spacetime-dependent horizon.

Abstract: From a conceptual point of view, this chapter may be viewed as an exercise in combining quantum field theory and general relativity in a controlled setting. Despite its apparent simplicity, this exercise is deeply rooted in highly non-trivial developments in superstring theory and holography, and it addresses what is arguably one of the most profound questions in quantum gravity: the fate of information in black hole evaporation. For this reason, one is naturally compelled to examine this exercise as carefully as possible, closely following the original authors.
  This chapter presents thus a detailed overview of recent work by Almheiri et al. and Penington on the AdS2 black hole information loss paradox and its proposed resolution within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The roles of generalized entanglement entropy, quantum extremal surfaces, the island conjecture, holography, and replica wormholes in this resolution are discussed in detail. The distinction between the von Neumann entropy and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in black hole physics is carefully clarified. It is shown that a phase transition at the Page time, between the trivial quantum extremal surface at the horizon and a non-vanishing quantum extremal surface located behind the horizon, leads to the correct Page curve.
  A simplified version of the information loss problem for the eternal AdS2 black hole, together with its resolution along similar lines, is also presented. The replica trick and its crucial role in computing entanglement entropies for various intervals in AdS2 are discussed at some length. However, the use of the replica trick in constructing replica wormholes that dominate the Euclidean path integral, thereby leading to the island rule and the correct quantum extremal surfaces, is only outlined.

TL;DR: This paper discusses noncommutative field theory (NCFT) and its novel phenomena, particularly its role in unifying quantum mechanics and gravity through spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and the emergence of new geometric structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how NCFT extends quantum field theory by replacing commuting spacetime coordinates with a noncommutative structure, which has implications for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity and understanding quantum gravity at the Planck scale.

Method: It begins by explaining the mathematical foundations of NCFT and supersymmetry, then applies this framework to discuss specific phenomena such as ultraviolet-infrared mixing and emergent geometric structures, finally presenting implications for quantum gravity.

Result: The paper concludes that NCFT provides a fruitful theoretical framework for quantum gravity, offering a model where spacetime itself is quantized and leading to insights into phenomena like spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and the transition from discrete to continuous geometry.

Conclusion: Overall, this paper highlights how NCFT bridges quantum mechanics and geometry, offering new perspectives on fundamental physics.

Abstract: Noncommutative field theory (NCFT) is an extension of quantum field theory (QFT) that redefines spacetime, replacing commuting coordinates with a noncommutative structure. This shift fundamentally alters the way fields, interactions, and symmetries are understood. NCFT uniquely integrates with supersymmetry, making it a natural framework for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity. It also provides a consistent mechanism for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Unlike conventional QFT, which quantizes fields on a fixed spacetime, NCFT begins by quantizing spacetime itself. This perspective reveals novel phenomena, such as ultraviolet-infrared mixing and a natural transition from discrete to continuous geometries. It offers insights into quantum gravity at the Planck scale. Mathematically, NCFT bridges quantum mechanics and geometry through operator algebras, enabling the exploration of new theories unattainable in traditional frameworks. This dual role cements NCFT as a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We compute the quantum rate for massless charged scalar emission by a near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole using Schwarzian theory as the effective description of the black hole. This is compared to the semi-classical Hawking rate which we also compute near extremality. We classify black holes into small and large, each with a unique spectrum. For small black holes, at energies below a particular quantum scale, the emission is captured by the quantum rate, which gives different predictions from the semi-classical. Furthermore, depending on how the energy compares to another scale associated with the phenomenon of superradiance, the radiation either comes out as mostly non-superradiant or mostly superradiant. For non-superradiant emission, it is found that the quantum rate is suppressed compared to the semi-classical in the same way as recently observed for neutral radiation. For superradiant emission, a novel behavior is observed, the quantum rate is enhanced compared to the semi-classical. For large black holes, we argue that the quantum rate always reduces to the semi-classical. In the limit of very large black holes, from our semi-classical rate, we recover the Gibbons result of Schwinger-like suppression. This gives a unified story of near-extremal charged emission rates, both quantum and semi-classical, which covers all sizes of black hole and all energy regimes. We use these rates to discuss the evaporation history of each type of black hole, from when it starts very near extremality, until it has left this regime. Finally, for the near-extremal Kerr black hole, we argue that the quantum rate always reduces to the semi-classical with the superradiant modes dominating. This rate is computed for spin $0,1,2$. Our analysis emphasizes the AdS$_2$ structure of the Reissner-Nordström and Kerr near-horizon regions, which enables a completely parallel treatment of the two.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence states an equivalence between a quantum gravitational theory in a (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS$_{d+1}$) and a d-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT$_{d}$). The CFT$_{d}$ lives on the asymptotic boundary of the bulk AdS$_{d+1}$. Hence a local operator in the bulk of the AdS$_{d+1}$ should be reconstructable using operators living on the asymptotic boundary at the same instant. The existence of such a reconstruction is highly nontrivial and is conceptually puzzling if we think in terms of physically detecting a local bulk particle from the boundary of the AdS$_{d+1}$, as this signals a non-local information encoding scheme. In this paper, we explore situations where such non-locally encoded information can be observed in semiclassical gravity. We study examples where it is more efficient to utilize such effects in quantum gravity to detect a bulk excitation than to wait for signals to reach the boundary. Furthermore, we provide exemplified situations for which the protocol fails, and the non-locality of information is suppressed. These exemplified scenarios can be taken as explicit examples of the emergence of a perturbatively localized observer. In such cases, holography cannot be proven at the perturbative level in Newton's constant $G_{N}$ via the non-localizability of information.

Abstract: We investigate the universal behaviour of a one-parameter generalisation of the six-vertex model on planar graphs, which we refer to as the 7-vertex model (7vM). The 7vM is characterised by a temperature coupling and its continuum limit is characterised by a massive, dilute and dense phases similarly to the $O(n)$ loop model. We compute the sphere and disk partition functions of the 7vM from the spectral curve of the dual matrix model, abbreviated here as 7vMM. The disk partition function for fixed length is expressed in terms of an uncharted deformation of the K-Bessel functions. We argue that 7vMM and Matrix Quantum Mechanics (MQM) provide two complementary non-perturbative realisations of sine-Liouville gravity. Specifically, we find that the continuum limit of 7vMM and the MQM share the same classical spectral curve but describe two different types of branes in sine-Liouville gravity. The 7vMM precisely covers the range of parameters where the Minkowskian MQM lacks a simple interpretation in terms of multiple tachyon scattering. We investigate the flow relating the dilute and the dense phases and argue that this flow is the gravitational analogue of the massless flow in the sine-Gordon model with imaginary mass coupling. The two extremities of the flow are described by a free boson coupled to Liouville gravity and compactified at circles with two different radii.

Abstract: We study the correlation functions between the dynamical variables and between their conjugate momenta at sites of a harmonic lattice in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space. We show that at the thermodynamic limit, they can be expressed in terms of Lauricella's C-type hypergeometric series.

By utilizing these expressions, we expect to make it easier to create programs that compute fast and highly precise for the quantum information quantities of subsystems within lattices.

Abstract: A universal class of light-ray operators formed from null integrals of the stress tensor is constructed in generic interacting Lorentzian conformal field theories in four spacetime dimensions. This class of light-ray operators generates the wedge algebra of ${\rm w}_{1+\infty}$, which was recently identified among the asymptotic symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes. In four-dimensional conformal field theories with an additional spin-one conserved current, a second universal class of light-ray operators is constructed and shown to generate the ''$S$ algebra,'' the gauge-theoretic analog of ${\rm w}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, a precise relation is established between the one-point functions of these light-ray operators in scalar states and the universal soft factors in the infinite tower of soft graviton theorems. The results presented in this paper will be accompanied by detailed calculations and proofs in a longer forthcoming work.

Motivation: Understanding the symmetries of string theory is crucial for connecting different solutions and dual descriptions in theoretical physics.

Method: The analysis involves examining duality transformations in both AdS and flat space-time, considering the role of exotic branes, and exploring observable consequences.

Result: In flat space-time, duality transformations are broken discrete gauge symmetries observable via exotic branes, while in generic AdS space-time, they're broken explicitly in the dual conformal field theory.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates how exotic branes restore observable duality symmetries in flat space-time, providing a bridge between solutions in string theory that are not connected by continuous symmetries.

Abstract: Are duality transformations symmetries of string theory? For AdS space-time the answer is no for generic asymptotic values of the moduli, since the duality symmetry is broken explicitly in the dual conformal field theory. In contrast, in string theory in flat space-time, monodromy around codimension two exotic branes show that duality transformations are spontaneously broken discrete gauge symmetries with observable consequences, provided macroscopic loops of these branes are not hidden behind an event horizon. We discuss how this can be achieved and how the situation in flat space-time differs from that in AdS space-time. We also discuss observability of codimension two non-BPS branes and codimension one BPS and non-BPS branes.

Abstract: The holographic product formula is used to determine the general form taken by holographic spectral functions in the near-extremal hydrodynamic regime, with energy $ω$, momentum $k$ and temperature $T$ much smaller than a hard scale $μ$. The resulting expressions simplify in the extremal limit $T \ll ω,k\ll μ$, for which the low-temperature gapless modes and the IR conformal behavior factorize. In some cases, this factorization extends to the general near-extremal regime $ω,k,T\llμ$ at leading order in $T/μ$. Several examples are discussed with different types of gapless modes and IR CFTs, including new numerical results for low temperature quasi-normal modes. We end with a concrete application that shows how the inclusion of the IR conformal behavior improves the description of the spectral function at low energies.

Motivation: understand if charged black holes with Dunkl derivatives have unique thermodynamic properties, stability, and phase transition behaviors.

Method: calculate Ricci tensor/scalar via Christoffel symbols, modify Einstein equations with Dunkl derivations to get metric, compute thermodynamic quantities, analyze criticality, and explore phase transitions.

Result: new class of charged Dunkl black holes with unique thermodynamic properties, identified P-v criticality with PcvcTc universal, found phase transitions via Gibbs free energy, and analogies/differences with Van der Waals.

Conclusion: introduction of Dunkl derivatives leads to novel charged black hole solutions with thermodynamic and phase transition properties analogous yet distinct from Van der Waals fluids.

Abstract: In this work, we derive a new class of charged black holes by introducing Dunkl derivatives in the four dimensional spacetime. To construct such solutions, we first compute the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar using the Christoffel symbols. Substituting them into the modified Einstein field equations via extended Dunkl derivations, we obtain the metric function of charged Dunkl black holes. Next, we investigate the charge effect on the corresponding thermodynamical properties by computing the associated quantities. To study the thermal stability, we calculate the heat capacity. After that, we approach the P-v criticality behaviors by determining the critical pressure Pc, the critical temperature Tc and the critical specific volume vc in terms of Q and two parameters A and B carrying data on the Dunkl reflections. Precisely, we show that the ratio Pcvc Tc is a universal number with respect to the charge Q and B parameters. Taking a zero limit of A, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors. For Joule-Thomson expansion effects for such charged black holes, we reveal certain similarities and the differences with Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we discuss the phase transitions via the Gibbs free energy computations.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解无平均晶格势的量子临界系统提供了理论框架，这些结果可能在实际材料中寻找类似行为具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: We study DC and AC thermoelectric and magneto-transport in 2D quantum critical theories with strong translational symmetry breaking due to a % varying chemical potential lattice with zero average $\barμ=0$. The combination of quantum criticality and the absence of the average natural scale implies that such systems have idiosyncratic signatures that may apply more generally when the variance in the lattice potential far exceeds the average or for strong translational symmetry breaking in general. We model such theories holographically through near-extremal AdS black holes. We find that these systems (a) become \emph{better} conductors. In a 2D lattice, this can be explained by currents flowing around obstacles; (b) exhibit bad-metal electrical transport with Drude-like thermal transport, though it is not Drude, and, notably, (c) display an approximately $B$-linear longitudinal magnetoresistance at large fields, similar to Effective Medium Theory. We comment on how these results may apply when $\barμ\neq 0$.

Abstract: An in-in framework under Schwinger pair creating fields in strong-field quantum electrodynamics is formulated using in-out propagators in coordinate space, that have first-quantized or worldline representation. The framework is derived to all orders in the background field coupling from both the Bogoliubov coefficient method and Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path formalism. In-out matrix elements in pair creating fields are readily handled using first-quantized methods, and the approach we develop serves to facilitate the evaluation of in-in observables in pair creating backgrounds. We find that in-in augmentations to the in-out partition function and or propagator amount to the insertion of a non-local interaction term that sandwiches a function that serves to enclose singularities in complex Schwinger propertime. Furthermore, we show the resummation of the in-in partition function leading to vacuum non-persistence that en-route gives an exact first-quantized definition of creating $N$-pairs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explore a new route toward a non-perturbative quantization of gravity based on a purely affine formulation, where the affine connection is the fundamental field and the metric, when it exists, emerges as a derived quantity. Starting from the Palatini formulation of General Relativity, we recall how an equivalent Eddington-type purely affine action arises at the classical level under mild assumptions. A key feature for the non-perturbative program is that, in the pure gravity case, for a positive cosmological constant, the action is bounded below, allowing one to define a well-posed statistical ensemble of connections. We discretize this theory on a fixed hypercubic lattice and construct the corresponding partition function, including torsionful and torsionless ensembles. We provide an open C++ Monte Carlo implementation that can simulate these ensembles in arbitrary dimension, and we present proof-of-principle results in two dimensions.

Method: 基于超对称和玻色子弦理论的分析，构建了SL(2,R)WZW模型的 worldsheets描述，并通过关联的 partition functions读取了弦谱。

Result: 非tachyon型弦在两者背景下允许非平凡Wilson环，导致经典模空间出现tachyonic区域，威胁了真空的稳定性，具体在AdS3×S3×S3×S1空间中进行了具体例证。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在AdS3×S3×T4和AdS3×S3×S3×S1背景下，非tachyon型弦的局域量子效应可能导致经典模空间不稳定。需要进一步研究如何利用这些局域效应抑制或消除不稳定性，以确保弦论中的真空稳定。

Abstract: We explore the quantisation of the tachyonic type 0B superstring and the non-tachyonic $\text{Spin}(16) \times \text{Spin}(16) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic string on AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times T^4$ and AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ backgrounds. Adapting the analysis for the supersymmetric and bosonic string theories to these set-ups, we provide a world-sheet description for a generic level of the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ WZW model, and we read the spectrum through the associated partition functions. Focusing on the low-energy theory, we show that the $\text{Spin}(16) \times \text{Spin}(16) \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ heterotic string on both backgrounds accommodates non-trivial Wilson lines that are responsible for the appearance of tachyonic regions in the classical moduli space, hence jeopardising the stability of the vacuum. We show this with a concrete example on the AdS$_3 \times S^3 \times S^3 \times S^1$ space and provide general formulas for a systematic analysis of the classical moduli space.

Abstract: We show that the semiclassical limit of thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations naturally reconstructs the algebro-geometric spectra of finite-gap periodic potentials. This correspondence is illustrated using the traveling-wave (snoidal) solution of the defocusing modified Korteweg--de Vries equation. In this framework, the Bethe-root distribution of the associated quantum field theory yields an Abelian differential of the second kind on the elliptic Riemann surface specified by the spectral endpoints, a structure central to the algebro-geometric theory of solitons. The semiclassical parameter is identified with the large-rank limit of the internal symmetry group ($O(2N)$) of the underlying quantum field theory (the Gross-Neveu model with a chemical potential). Our analysis indicates that the analytic structure of the spectrum is dictated solely by the Dynkin diagram ($D_N$) and its large-rank limit ($D_\infty$), independently of the particular integrable model used to realize it.

Abstract: We propose '$\mathrm{d} \mathcal{E}$-forms' as fundamental building blocks of canonical integrands for elliptic Feynman integrals, which lead to Kronecker-Eisenstein $ω$-form symbol letters. Built upon pure elliptic multiple polylogarithms, they provide a natural extension of the '$\mathrm{d} \! \log$-form' integrands and $\mathrm{d} \! \log$ letters for polylogarithmic cases. By introducing an extended basis treating all marked points equally, we manifest a hidden symmetry structure in the canonical connection matrix, and demonstrate its covariance under modular transformations. Our result provides a novel perspective on describing canonical bases and symbol letters in a unified language of pure functions.

Abstract: We study a Euclidean quantum field theory of two interacting real scalar fields in $D=4-ε$ dimensions with the most general two--derivative but Lorentz--violating quadratic structure, allowing anisotropic spatial gradients and field--mixing time and cross--gradient terms, together with general cubic and quartic interactions. Although Lorentz violation is introduced only through the kinetic sector, the renormalization structure is nontrivial: interactions generate additional couplings, including masses and linear terms, so a consistent renormalization--group analysis cannot be formulated in terms of modified kinetic terms alone and requires an RG--complete operator basis compatible with the reduced symmetry.
  We perform a systematic one--loop renormalization and derive the complete set of beta functions for cubic and quartic couplings, masses, and linear terms. We identify and analyze the resulting fixed points and fixed manifolds, showing in particular how anisotropy restricts their existence and stability. In particular we obtain how anisotropy restricts existence of canonical Wilson-Fisher fixed point. Also we provide a transparent physical interpretation of the anisotropy--dependent coefficients appearing in the beta functions and clarify how kinetic mixing reshapes the interaction flow through the available ultraviolet phase space.

Abstract: Supergravity calculations of holographic four-point correlation functions are a powerful tool for deriving dynamical information about the dual field theory at strong coupling. Recently, a number of such computations have been performed by studying light probes of smooth horizonless supergravity solutions, including certain asymptotically $AdS_5\times S^5$ solutions of Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) type. We construct a new closed-form perturbative LLM solution involving a pair of linearized supergravitons with different mode numbers and their quadratic backreaction. Using this solution, we compute two infinite sequences of four-point correlators. Depending on the scaling of certain parameters, the background supergravity solutions are dual to states of 4D $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory that are either heavy or light, whereupon the correlators in the dual field theory are either (perturbatively) heavy-heavy-light-light or all-light. In the all-light regime, the correlators we compute are related by superconformal Ward identities to correlators of four single-particle chiral primary operators (CPOs). We confirm a set of expressions in the literature for such correlators of CPOs, that were obtained via Mellin space bootstrap and/or Witten diagram methods. We also obtain a novel compact expression for one of the two infinite sequences of correlators of chiral primaries.

Motivation: Understanding quantum gravity through holographic principles and tensor networks is a key motivation in theoretical physics.

Method: The author developed two models: the factorized PEE tensor network and the random PEE tensor network, using quantum states assigned to network vertices.

Result: These models successfully reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a concrete tool for studying quantum gravity.

Conclusion: This work advances holographic tensor networks as tools for quantum gravity research.

Abstract: Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.

Conclusion: 展示了如何在 Wu 伴 manifold 中构建 spin^h 结构，并用于后续维度约简研究。

Abstract: Generalised spin structures are necessary for placing fermions on manifolds that do not admit a standard spin structure. This is especially relevant in a dimensional reduction on such a manifold, which can then be compensated by using fermions that are appropriately charged under some Maxwell or Yang-Mills field defined on the internal manifold. A well known example in the physics literature is $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which has four real dimensions and is the coset $SU(3)/U(2)$. In this paper we focus on a five-dimensional coset space, namely the Wu manifold $SU(3)/SO(3)_{\rm max}$, where $SO(3)_{\rm max}$ is maximal in $SU(3)$. Intriguingly, the Wu manifold does not admit a spin structure or spin$^c$ structure, it does admit a spin$^h$ structure. We provide a physical interpretation of the spin$^h$ structure by considering spinors that are coupled to an $SO(3)$ Yang-Mills field defined on the Wu manifold, but which carry half-integer "isospin," thereby canceling the minus sign in the holonomy for uncharged spinors that provides the original obstruction to an ordinary spin structure. We also construct a gauge-covariantly constant spinor in the Wu manifold, and we show how this can be employed in order to construct spin$^h$ spinor harmonics from scalar harmonics. We provide a very explicit construction of all the scalar and spin$^h$ harmonics. In a follow-up paper, we shall employ the results we obtain here in order to discuss dimensional reductions and consistent reductions on the Wu manifold.

Conclusion: 这项研究为高阶伽利略近似论下的引力相互作用计算填补了重要空白，特别是在静力极限下。提供了计算两体引力相互作用的重要数据，将有助于更准确地预测事件如双黑洞合并的复杂性。

Abstract: We compute the gravitational interaction of two coalescing compact objects at sixth post-Newtonian order in the static limit, employing the diagrammatic approach within the effective field theory framework of General Relativity. The calculation requires the evaluation of six-loop Feynman diagrams that are mapped onto two-point integrals with a gauge-theory-like structure, which are computed here for the first time. The resulting seventh-order contribution in Newton's constant is finite in three space dimensions. This result provides the most technically demanding missing ingredient for the determination of the conservative dynamics of the gravitational two-body system at sixth post-Newtonian order.

Abstract: Structure Functions for small DIS (deep inelastic scattering) $x$ for integrable models are investigated, in particular, for the $O(N)$~$σ$-model and $SU(N)$ chiral Gross-Neveu model, which are asymptotically free. We get the universal behavior $x^{-1}\ln^{-2}x$ at small Bjorken variable $x$ and confirm a Balog Weisz conjecture. For a the second group of models, the Sine-Gordon, sinh-Gordon and $Z(N)$, we find power behavior $x^{-λ}$. The special behavior of the structure function for the Sine-Gordon model is probably crucial for future investigation in 4D QCD.

TL;DR: 研究者提出了一个几何扩展的BPS构造，用于在任意静态时空曲率中描述标量 WRONG kinks的(1+1)维静态曲线。通过引入非最小的标量预设与时空几何中静態分割的外在曲率之间的非最小耦合，平直空间中的第一性阶Bogomolny方程仍然完全有效，无论时空几何如何。这导致kink轮廓不受影响，而有效势能和零点结构获得了可控的几何依赖性。研究者表明，这些弯曲空间中的BPS-WRINKS总是线性稳定。然而，平移零模式的存在与否并不明确：其可规范化依赖于kink自身的内在尺度与几何曲率渐进行为的对比。当几何尺度占优时，零模式被去除，孤子因此几何上被钉死，尽管它仍然是一个精确的BPS-WRINKS。使用AdS2实现表明，不同的静止切片导致 qualitatively不同的物理结果，从保留平移不变性再到被视界完全消除。这些结果证实了几何作为精确控制孤子模体的机制，同时保持了线性稳定性。

Abstract: We present a geometric extension of the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) construction for scalar kinks in (1+1) dimensions embedded in static curved spacetimes. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between the scalar prepotential and the extrinsic curvature of the static foliation, the flat-space first-order Bogomolny equation remains exactly valid for arbitrary static backgrounds. As a consequence, the kink profile is unchanged, while the effective potential and vacuum structure acquire a controlled geometric dependence. We show that these curved-space BPS kinks are always linearly stable. However, the existence of the translational zero mode is not guaranteed: its normalizability depends on the competition between the intrinsic length scale of the kink and the asymptotic curvature scale of the geometry. When the geometric scale dominates, the zero mode is removed and the soliton becomes geometrically pinned, despite remaining an exact BPS solution. Explicit realizations in AdS2 demonstrate how different static slicings of the same spacetime lead to qualitatively distinct physical outcomes, ranging from preserved translational invariance to its complete removal by horizons. These results establish geometry as a precise mechanism for controlling solitonic moduli without compromising linear stability.

Abstract: We continue the study, initiated in [hep-th:2504.18619], of topological defect lines (TDLs) in the Conway module $V^{f \natural}$ and K3 non-linear sigma models (NLSMs). In the case of $V^{f \natural}$, we fully classify the potential $N=1$ (and $N=4$)--preserving duality defects for cyclic Tambara--Yamagami categories TY$(\mathbb{Z}_N)$, noting a curious relation to genus zero groups of monstrous moonshine. We use the correspondence with Leech lattice endomorphisms, discovered in [hep-th:2504.18619], to construct a number of non-trivial examples of TDLs in $V^{f \natural}$, including examples of irrational quantum dimension. In particular, we fully classify and construct defects for the TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and TY$(\mathbb{Z}_3)$ cases, and provide examples of duality defects for TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ and Fibonacci fusion categories as well. In the case of K3 NLSMs, we describe a duality defect of irrational quantum dimension $\sqrt{2}$ for the category TY$(\mathbb{Z}_2, -1)$ in a particular torus orbifold, which exists on a 16-dimensional slice of the moduli space. We also provide a detailed analysis of spectral flow--preserving TDLs in Gepner models of K3, of independent interest, and use this to construct non-invertible defects for Fibonacci and $Rep(S_3)$ categories in particular examples. Finally we provide evidence for our conjecture in [hep-th:2504.18619] that special subcategories of such TDLs in $V^{f \natural}$ correspond to $N=(4,4)$ and spectral flow--preserving defect lines in a corresponding K3 NLSM. In particular, we compute defect--twined elliptic genera for all non-invertible defects constructed in this article, demonstrating that for each defect found in a K3 NLSM, there is a corresponding defect in $V^{f \natural}$ with coincident twining genus, and making a prediction for a number of TDLs in K3 NLSMs yet to be found.

Abstract: Near-AdS$_2$ spacetimes are controlled by a Schwarzian effective dual theory. The Kaluza-Klein reduction of higher-dimensional black holes shows that the Schwarzian generates a logarithmic contribution to the entropy, thereby resolving a long-standing puzzle in near-extremal black hole thermodynamics. Here, we leverage exact results for quantum-corrected, Schwarzian scalar correlation functions in order to evaluate the impact of bulk quantum fluctuations on the low-temperature shear correlators of the state dual to Reissner-Nordström-AdS$_4$ black holes with a flat, compact horizon. In the hydrodynamic regime, we find that quantum fluctuations tend to increase the shear viscosity away from $s/(4π)$, thereby preserving the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound. Outside the hydrodynamic regime, quantum fluctuations lift the zero temperature, classical gapless modes reported in previous literature.

Abstract: In type IIB supergravity (SUGRA), in the extremal background of a number N_c of D3-branes we consider a number N_f of probe D7-branes extended along all four D3-brane directions, (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3). Using (x_2,x_3) to define complex coordinates (z,\bar{z}) and defining the D7-branes' worldvolume scalars as (y,\bar{y}), we prove that any holomorphic function y(z) or antiholomorphic function y(\bar{z}) is a BPS solution of the D7-branes' equations of motion preserving N=(4,0) or (0,4) supersymmetry (SUSY) along (x_0,x_1), respectively. In the near-horizon geometry, five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime times a five-sphere, the AdS/Conformal Field Theory correspondence states that type IIB SUGRA is holographically dual to four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory at large N_c and large 't Hooft coupling, and the N_f D7-branes are dual to N_f N=2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, i.e. flavour fields. Our D7-brane solutions are dual to a position-dependent hypermultiplet mass m that is holomorphic, m(z), or antiholomorphic, m(\bar{z}). We provide field theory proofs, valid for any N_c, N_f, and 't Hooft coupling, that such m preserve N=(4,0) or (0,4) SUSY along (x_0,x_1). We also perform holographic calculations with probe D7-branes to show that the theory with such m has zero energy and zero expectation value of the mass operator, and that a zero of m is dual to a superconformal defect described by chiral fermions along (x_0,x_1).

Abstract: We consider the problem of writing an effective, linearised theory in small derivatives that reproduces the Mittag-Leffler expansion of a charge current correlator with an arbitrary number of simple poles. We demonstrate how such a framework: can be compatible with hydrostaticity without modification of thermodynamics, properly accounts for the differing notions of smallness in time and space derivatives including setting the lowest order effective equation of motion, and corrects the effective equations in derivatives. As an application, we apply the results to charge fluctuations of the D3/D5 probe brane and quantify how the transport coefficients behave when quasihydrodynamics emerges at large charge density.

### [248] [Detecting the Unruh Effect via an Engineered Low-Mass Field in a Superconducting Qubit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17959)
*Vladimir Toussaint*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Detecting the Unruh effect is extremely challenging due to exponential suppression, making it practically undetectable for massive fields under current experimental conditions. To avoid suppression, fields require impractically high accelerations, but using massless fields instead allows for detection via engineered effective mass in superconducting circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses a significant gap in understanding the suppression mechanisms of the Unruh effect, providing explicit quantitative derivations that are crucial for both theoretical insights and experimental feasibility.

Method: The authors employ two frameworks—(3+1)-dimensional Unruh-DeWitt detectors and (1+1)-dimensional cavity QED—to derive the suppression factor, demonstrating the universality of the suppression across different systems.

Result: For electron-mass fields, the suppression is $10^9$ orders of magnitude, which is an astronomically high barrier to detection. Engineering effective mass in superconducting circuits offers a practical workaround, with specific conditions for optimal detection.

Conclusion: The suppression of the Unruh effect is a fundamental barrier, necessitating the use of massless fields or engineered effective masses for detection. This work sets a benchmark for future experimental designs aiming to probe the Unruh effect under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Detecting the Unruh effect is a major challenge in fundamental physics. It is known that exciting massive fields with the Unruh thermal bath is heavily suppressed when the field's rest energy is much larger than the acceleration energy scale, $Mc^2 \gg\hbar a/c$. However, the standard literature lacks an explicit quantitative derivation of this suppression. In this work, we first fill this gap by deriving the exponential suppression, $\sim \exp(-\text{constant}\times Mc^2/(\hbar a/c))$, in two different frameworks: a (3+1)-dimensional Unruh-DeWitt detector and a (1+1)-dimensional cavity QED setup. This shows the suppression is universal and sets an insurmountable barrier for any detection method that relies on exciting massive fields. For an electron-mass field at achievable accelerations ($a \sim 10^{20}$ m/s$^2$), the suppression exceeds $10^9$ orders of magnitude. To avoid this suppression, the field's rest energy must be less than or of the order of the acceleration energy scale, $M c^2 \lesssim \hbar a / c$. Achieving this condition, however, requires astronomically high accelerations. For example, detecting the effect for an electron-mass field would require accelerations of $a \gtrsim 4.6\times 10^{29}$ m/s$^2$, which is far beyond experimental reach. While using a massless field avoids this suppression, we show the best strategy is not to avoid mass, but to engineer a small effective mass that satisfies the optimal condition $\hbar a / c \gg M_{\text{eff}} c^2$. We propose a concrete implementation using a superconducting circuit with a Josephson persistent-current qubit (the analog of a UDW detector) coupled to a microwave resonator (the analog of the scalar field). For this system, the optimal condition is $2I_pΔΦ\gg Δ$, where $I_p$ is the persistent current, $ΔΦ$ is the magnetic flux swing, and $Δ$ is the qubit's tunneling energy gap....

TL;DR: We searched for gravitational waves from a Vela neutron star glitch and found no significant detections, but we set upper limits on the gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than previous estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding neutron star physics, especially glitch mechanisms, is important. Gravitational waves can provide insights and help identify the nature of these glitches.

Method: Observed data from LIGO detectors during the April 2024 event, searching for both burst-like and quasi-monochromatic signals related to pulsar glitches.

Result: No significant gravitational wave detections were found, but upper strain limits were established using data from both detectors.

Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of gravitational wave observations in studying neutron star glitches, even in the face of current detection limitations.

Abstract: Among known neutron stars, the Vela pulsar is one of the best targets for gravitational-wave searches. It is also one of the most prolific in terms of glitches, sudden frequency changes in a pulsar's rotation. Such glitches could cause a variety of transient gravitational-wave signals. Here we search for signals associated with a Vela glitch on 29 April 2024 in data of the two LIGO detectors from the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale. We discuss the short- and long-duration observational constraints in the context of specific emission models. These results demonstrate the potential of gravitational-wave probes of glitching pulsars as detector sensitivity continues to improve.

### [250] [A warp drive with predominantly positive invariant energy density and global Hawking-Ellis Type I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18008)
*José Rodal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: It is the first explicitly constructed, mathematically precise warp drive spacetime model in GR with a smooth and bounded stress-energy density. The model's stress-energy satisfies weaker energy conditions and eliminates significant local negative energy demands compared to the Alcubierre and Natario models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Warp drive spacetime models have been sought after for faster-than-light travel, but their practicality depends on the energy conditions required. This paper aims to reduce the negative energy requirements for such spacetimes.

Method: The authors build on Santiago et al.'s scalar-potential, zero-vorticity warp fields, and add a closed-form scalar potential and smooth shift components with proper boundary behavior. They use a Cartan-tetrad analytic pipeline and high-precision eigenanalysis.

Result: The irrotational warp drive spacetime has significantly less local negative energy compared to similar models. Its stress-energy is globally Hawking-Ellis Type I with a well-defined timelike eigenvalue. The model's negative-energy requirements are far more manageable.

Conclusion: This paper paves the way for more practical warp drive spacetime models with reduced energy demands.

Abstract: We present the first fully explicit, continuous, analytically derived warp-drive spacetime within General Relativity whose shift-vector flow is kinematically irrotational. Building on Santiago \emph{et al.} that scalar-potential, zero-vorticity warp fields are Hawking-Ellis Type I for unit lapse and flat spatial slices, we supply a closed-form scalar potential and smooth shift components with proper boundary behavior, together with a Cartan-tetrad analytic pipeline and high-precision eigenanalysis. Compared with the Alcubierre and Natário models (evaluated at identical parameters $ρ, σ, v/c$), our irrotational solution exhibits \emph{significantly reduced} local NEC/WEC stress: its peak proper-energy deficit is reduced by a factor of $\approx 38$ relative to Alcubierre and $\approx 2.6 \times 10^{3}$ relative to Natário, and its peak NEC violation is more than $60 \times$ smaller than Natário. Crucially, the stress-energy is \emph{globally} Hawking-Ellis Type I, with a well-defined timelike eigenvalue (proper energy density) everywhere. A fixed-smoothing vortical ablation confirms that this improvement is causally due to irrotational, curl-free kinematics rather than profile shaping: adding modest vorticity collapses the $E_{+} / E_{-}$ balance and drives large increases in the negative-energy magnitude $E_{-}$. We quantify the negative-energy requirement via a \emph{slice-integrated} (on $Σ_{t}$) negative-energy volume and tabulate global measures. A far-field extrapolation to $R \to \infty$ yields tail-corrected totals $|E_{+} - E_{-}| / (E_{+} + E_{-}) = 0.04\%$. Thus the net \emph{proper} energy is consistent with zero to four decimal places (in fractional units). We also establish regularity at $r=0$ for the irrotational construction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A detection method for high-frequency gravitational waves using two-dimensional ion crystals is investigated. Gravitational waves can resonantly excite the drumhead modes of the ion crystal, particularly the parity-odd modes. In the optical dipole force protocol, entanglement between the drumhead modes and the collective spins transfers the excitation of the drumhead modes to the rotation of the total spin. Furthermore, gravitational wave detection beyond the standard quantum limit becomes possible as a squeezed spin state is generated through this entanglement. The sensitivity gets better with a larger ions crystals as well as a larger number of the ions. Future realization of large ion crystals can significantly improve the sensitivity to gravitational waves in the 10 kHz to 10 MHz region.

### [252] [Emergence of the cosmic space inspired by mass-to-horizon entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18054)
*Ahmad Sheykhi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Emergent gravity through spacetime thermodynamics bridges quantum information and cosmic expansion, deriving modified Friedmann equations in both equilibrium and dynamic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent gravity is a fascinating area that connects quantum information theory with cosmology, seeking to understand gravity as a thermodynamic phenomenon emerging from spacetime structure.

Method: The authors employ two thermodynamic approaches: equilibrium (applying first law to apparent horizon) and Padmanabhan’s dynamic framework, incorporating a mass-to-horizon entropy relation. They derive modified Friedmann equations via two independent routes.

Result: A mass-to-horizon entropy relation successfully links information-theoretic spacetime microstructure to its cosmological description. The modified Friedmann equations are consistent with both thermodynamic frameworks, and generalized second law is fulfilled.

Conclusion: This work provides compelling evidence for a thermodynamic origin of gravity, underscoring the deep connection between quantum information and spacetime geometry.

Abstract: The conception of gravity as an emergent phenomenon, rooted in the thermodynamics of spacetime, offers a radical departure from its geometric description. This paper investigates the emergence of cosmic space by synthesizing two key thermodynamic approaches: the equilibrium perspective, where the first law of thermodynamics is applied to the apparent horizon, and the dynamic perspective of Padmanabhan, where the cosmic space emerges as cosmic time progresses. The central element of our study is the incorporation of a mass-to-horizon entropy relation, $M=γ{c^2 L^n}/{G}$, where $M$ denotes the effective mass associated with the system, $L$ corresponds to the cosmological horizon, and $γ$ is a constant with dimensions $[L]^{1-n}$. We first use this relation within the Clausius relation and apply the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_h dS_h+WdV$, on the apparent horizon to derive the modified Friedmann equations. Subsequently, we embed the mass-to-horizon entropy relation into Padmanabhan's cosmic emergence proposal, the dependence of the volume change on the degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the boundary, and show its consistency with the thermodynamically derived equations. The successful reconstruction of the modified Friedmann equations through these independent yet convergent thermodynamic routes strongly suggests that the mass-to-horizon entropy is a fundamental bridge between the information-theoretic microstructure of spacetime and its effective cosmological description. Finally, we show that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled for the universe enveloped by the apparent horizon.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We re-examine the recent claim that a Dirac particle freely falling in a uniform gravitational field exhibits a spin-dependent transverse deflection (gravitational spin Hall effect). Using a circulating mass model, we show that hidden momentum arises in uniform fields when an object carries angular momentum. On the quantum side, we analyze the Dirac Hamiltonian in a uniform potential, construct its Foldy--Wouthuysen form, and evaluate the Heisenberg evolution of spin-polarized Gaussian packets. The state used previously, with $\langle p\rangle =0$, is not at rest: because canonical and kinetic momenta differ, the packet carries a spin-dependent hidden momentum from $t=0$. Imposing $\langle x(0)\rangle =\langle v(0)\rangle=0$ requires a compensating spin-dependent $\langle p(0)\rangle$; with this preparation $\langle x(t)\rangle =0$ to leading order in the gravitational acceleration $g$. Generalizing, an exact Foldy--Wouthuysen transformation (linear in $g$ but to all orders in $1/c$) shows that spin-dependent transverse motion begins no earlier than at $O(g^2)$ for a broad class of wave packets. We conclude that a uniform field does not produce a gravitational spin Hall effect at linear order; the previously reported drift stems from inconsistent initial states and misinterpreting canonical momentum.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether Hawking-like quanta from a moving mirror can be purified by late-time vacuum fluctuations with a focus on energy requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research stems from recent discussions in Refs. [2,3] questioning whether vacuum purification has a prohibitively large energy cost. The authors aim to clarify this issue by exploring the relationship between quantum information purification and energy.

Method: The study involves analyzing the mirror's trajectory to identify factors influencing the partners of Hawking quanta and the energy carried to future null infinity. It avoids relying on a particle-based interpretation by using local correlation functions and energy fluxes.

Result: The key finding is a fundamental disconnect in quantum field theory between quantum information fluxes and energy fluxes. The paper introduces an analytic mirror trajectory that produces Hawking-like radiation with an adiabatically varying temperature, akin to evaporating black holes.

Conclusion: The research imposes constraints on the mirror's trajectory to maintain compatibility between vacuum purification and energy budget. The findings offer lessons for realistic evaporating black hole scenarios.

Abstract: This article investigates the possibility that Hawking-like quanta emitted by a moving mirror can be purified by late-time vacuum fluctuations, as proposed in Ref. [1]. Our motivation originates from recent discussions in Refs. [2,3] on whether vacuum purification necessarily entails a prohibitively large (indirect) energy cost, and our goal is to help clarify this issue. We identify the aspects of the mirror trajectory that determine the partners of Hawking quanta, as well as those that govern the energy carried to future null infinity. This allows us to highlight a fundamental disconnection within quantum field theory between the fluxes of quantum information (or purification) and energy. Throughout, we focus on quantities such as local correlation functions and energy fluxes, thereby avoiding reliance on a particle-based interpretation. Finally, we introduce an analytic mirror trajectory that produces Hawking radiation with an adiabatically varying temperature, mimicking the emission from an evaporating black hole. Our analysis identifies constraints on the mirror trajectory under which vacuum purification remains compatible with a prescribed energy budget, and we discuss the lessons that may be drawn from this model for realistic evaporating black holes.

Abstract: In this paper, we study 2+2 direct product spacetimes sourced by separated electromagnetic and Yang--Mills fields within Weyl conformal gravity. We prove that all such configurations admit at least 2 independent, commuting non-null Killing vectors, which we use to find general solutions. As a special case, we obtain a generalization of the Birkhoff--Riegert theorem to all spacetimes containing a two-dimensional subspace of constant Gaussian curvature, and we also revisit the original formulation of the theorem. We further analyze the resulting solutions in terms of Weyl equivalence classes. Their connections to known solutions in both Weyl conformal gravity and Einstein gravity are established through conformal relations. We also examine the fundamental physical and geometric properties of the newly obtained configurations and their equivalence classes.

Abstract: An approach to construct cosmological inflation models on the basis of a certain dependence of the scalar field evolution on the e-folds number is considered. The reconstruction of the model background parameters according to the kind of specific connection between the parameters of cosmological perturbations is proposed. By the slow-roll approximation, as functions of the e-fold number, the scalar field potential and the Hubble parameter are determined. The logarithmic dependence between the scalar field evolution and the number of e-folds is investigated as the example. The derived model was found to obey a quadratic law between the parameters of cosmological perturbations. On the basis of suggested approach, a new cosmological inflation model with an exponential potential is proposed. This complies with existing observational constraints for both background and perturbation spectrum parameters. A comparison of obtained results with the solutions obtained by the symbol regression is made. The restrictions for arbitrary parameters in the model with logarithmic potential are also considered. The proposed form of the scalar field potential is consistent with one of the optimal potentials obtained when using machine learning methods to analyze the correspondence of inflationary models to observational data and gravitational waves contribution to the anisotropy and polarization of the CMB.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the thermodynamic and optical properties of the Bumblebee Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, a rotating and charged configuration arising in Lorentz symmetry-violating (LSV) gravity. The influence of the black hole parameters on the horizon structure, thermodynamic stability, and geometric deformation of spacetime is systematically investigated. Explicit expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity are derived, revealing the formation of black hole remnants and extended stability phases induced by Lorentz symmetry-violating (LSV) effects. The sparsity of Hawking radiation is quantified, showing that Lorentz violation suppresses the continuum limit and produces a more discrete, less thermal emission spectrum. A detailed analysis of null geodesics is performed to determine the photon region and shadow morphology, indicating that increasing l and Q compresses and distorts the shadow boundary, while rotation diminishes its overall size. The ergosphere geometry is analyzed in detail, showing that increases in a, l, and Q not only enlarge and distort the ergoregion but also intensify frame-dragging, thereby maximizing the efficiency of energy extraction via the Penrose process. These results reveal clear and potentially observable deviations from standard Kerr-Newman-AdS predictions, providing a powerful new avenue to probe Lorentz symmetry breaking and test the fundamental structure of gravity in extreme strong field regimes.

Abstract: Locally covariant algebraic quantum field theory (LCQFT) satisfies Einstein causality through microcausality and operational no-signalling, yet Bell-type correlations persist in entangled field states across spacelike regions. We demonstrate that this apparent tension reflects a fundamental covariance obstruction: no assignment of classical past variables can simultaneously be covariant under spacetime embeddings, screen off quantum correlations, and reproduce AQFT statistics. This obstruction is distinct from dynamical nonlocality or signalling violations. We formalize this as a no-go theorem in the category-theoretic framework of LCQFT, showing that Bell's notion of local causality -- requiring factorization conditioned on a common past -- is structurally incompatible with diffeomorphism covariance. The failure of Bell locality thus reflects not a breakdown of relativistic causality but the impossibility of embedding quantum correlations into a classical causal framework without introducing preferred foliations or non-covariant beables. This clarifies the conceptual status of nonlocality in relativistic quantum theory.

Abstract: Semiclassical gravity, in which a classical spacetime is sourced by the quantum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor, is a standard framework for describing the gravitational interaction of quantum matter. In the nonrelativistic limit this approach leads to the Schrödinger-Newton equation, which is often assumed to be consistent at least in the weak-field regime. In this work, we reexamine this assumption for spatial quantum superpositions of massive particles. We show that, when the quantum state is properly normalized, no modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential arises at leading order. However, at first post-Newtonian order the semiclassical coupling generically produces state-dependent contributions involving the mass density and the mass current of the superposition. These terms have a parametric scaling which is different from that of the corresponding relativistic corrections and which does not have Planck mass suppression. Our results therefore impose a strong post-Newtonian consistency constraint on deterministic semiclassical gravity, indicating that sourcing the metric solely by expectation values is insufficient to recover a consistent relativistic weak-field expansion.

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of parametrized black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the high-overtone limit. To gain insights into their analytical structure, we apply the exact WKB method, which was recently developed by the same authors. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed in good agreement with the numerical results based on Leaver's method. For specific values of parametrization parameters that characterize deviations from general relativity, we find that the real part of asymptotic QNM frequencies diverges in the high-overtone limit, in sharp contrast to the case of a Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that the convergence of the real parts of high-overtone QNMs is a distinctive feature of general relativity, while parametrized corrections generically lead to divergent spectral behaviors.

Abstract: We examine classical radiation reaction by combining the covariant Lorentz--Dirac formulation, its Landau--Lifshitz (LL) order reduction, and a post-Newtonian (PN) Hamiltonian treatment of interacting and radiating charges. After reviewing the LL reduction and its removal of runaway and preacceleration behavior, we verify energy balance in several relativistic single-particle scenarios by demonstrating agreement between the LL Larmor power and the loss of mechanical energy. We then construct an N-body framework based on the conservative Darwin Hamiltonian supplemented with the leading 1.5PN radiation--reaction term. Numerical simulations of charge-neutral binary systems of both symmetric and asymmetric mass configurations show orbital decay, circularization, and monotonic Hamiltonian decrease consistent with dipole radiative losses. The resulting framework provides a simple analogue of gravitational PN radiation reaction and a tractable system for studying dissipative and potentially chaotic electromagnetic dynamics.

Abstract: The Laplace equation on Euclidean flat space admits a discrete radial inversion symmetry. In 1983, Couch and Torrence (CT) found -- surprisingly -- that the massless wave equation continues to display this symmetry on the background of an extremal (and asymptotically flat) black hole, where the inversion interchanges horizon and infinity while preserving the singularity structure of the separated radial mode equation. We revisit this CT inversion symmetry and investigate its possible extensions beyond the extremal (Reissner-Nordström or Kerr) setting in which it was originally identified. Using the example of the static lukewarm de Sitter black hole, we show that neither the exchange of horizon with infinity, nor the preservation of radial singularities, are essential features needed for a CT inversion to exist. Instead, we interpret CT transformations through their action on photon spheres, providing a unified viewpoint that extends to the (phase-space-dependent) CT inversions of the extremal Kerr-Newman geometry. For scalar fields on that spacetime, we find a simple relation between the fixed point of a CT inversion and the coefficient of superradiant scattering. Finally, we exhibit a hidden CT inversion symmetry that arises in the static limit of the Kerr Laplacian for all spins. Together, these results suggest that CT symmetry may admit a broader generalization than previously understood.

TL;DR: Gravitational waves can be microlensed by massive objects, and this work computes the resulting waveforms for a rotating compact object.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microlensing by gravitational waves offers a new way to study massive objects in the universe, and this work contributes to our ability to extract information about these objects using advanced detector technologies.

Method: The authors compute the microlensing waveforms for a rotating compact object in the weak-field regime and use these to infer parameters from GW observations, considering both standard and novel singular solutions.

Result: The study finds that lens parameters can be reliably determined with confidence levels of 90% for SNR 50 and better for SNR 100, which is promising for future high-precision gravitational wave astronomy.

Conclusion: This research advances our understanding of gravitational wave microlensing and highlights the potential for future detectors to probe the properties of massive objects through their gravitational effects on wavefronts.

Abstract: Propagating gravitational waves (GWs) can encounter a massive object (lens) whose gravitational radius is comparable to the wavelength of the GWs (wave-optics regime). The resulting `microlensed' signal contains imprints about the properties of the lens. In this work, we compute the GW waveforms microlensed by a rotating compact object in weak-field gravity. Using these waveforms, for the first time, we assess how well the parameters of the rotating lens can be inferred from GW lensing observations. We find that if we allow for naked singular solutions within general relativity or beyond, which in principle can have spins that are not bounded to be extremal, our method can be used to extract the rotating lens parameters using observations of microlensed GWs with future detectors. As a result, we find that the lens parameters for such lenses are well recovered within $90\%$ confidence for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 50 and especially well for SNR$=100$ with Einstein Telescope.

Abstract: We study polarization dependent photon propagation in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes permeated by strong magnetic fields, with the aim of quantifying how finite emission and detection radii modify vacuum birefringence signals. Working in the geometric optics limit of nonlinear electrodynamics, we formulate the two polarization modes as null geodesics of distinct effective (optical) metrics. We then develop a controlled weak-coupling expansion that cleanly separates the standard gravitational deflection from the birefringent contribution induced by the electromagnetic nonlinearity. Using a finite distance Gauss-Bonnet construction on the associated optical manifolds, we derive a general expression for the \emph{differential} bending angle in which the source and observer are kept at arbitrary radii, thereby extending the usual scattering-at-infinity treatment. As benchmark applications, we specialize our results to the Euler-Heisenberg effective action of QED and to Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We find that the observable birefringence is generically reduced by finite-distance truncation of the curvature flux, and we provide explicit correction series suitable for data analysis. For magnetar-motivated dipolar fields, this geometric effect yields a suppression factor that can diminish the predicted polarization-dependent deflection by as much as $\sim 50\%$ for limb emission relative to asymptotic scattering estimates. Our results furnish a necessary finite-distance calibration for interpreting current and future X-ray polarimetry measurements and for placing unbiased constraints on strong-field QED and broader NLED parameters.

TL;DR: This paper discusses deformed versions of Unimodular Gravity in the context of diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theories, showing how integrating out auxiliary fields leads to a pure connection formulation.

Motivation: The paper builds on the structure of Unimodular Gravity and its deformations, exploring the dynamics and degrees of freedom within diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theories, which are important in understanding gravity's quantum aspects and modifications to General Relativity.

Method: The authors employ the Plebanski action formalism, integrate auxiliary fields, and analyze the resulting pure connection action. They also use insights from the degrees of freedom in gauge theories to classify the broader class of propagating fields.

Result: The study reveals that by integrating out auxiliary fields, a pure connection action for the deformed UG can be derived. Additionally, it identifies a class of theories extending UG by propagating two complex degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of Unimodular Gravity's deformations within diffeomorphism-invariant frameworks, offering a wider class of theories with specific gravitational degrees of freedom that may have implications for quantum gravity studies.

Abstract: In this note, we consider the Henneaux-Teitelboim version of Unimodular Gravity (UG) and its deformations in the form of gauge theories with spontaneously broken diffeomorphism invariance. Actions defining such theories depends on the curvature of an $SO(3,\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and the field strength of a (real) 3-form (or equivalently its dual vector density). We obtain the pure connection action of the theory from the corresponding Plebanski action by integrating out auxiliary fields. Then we show that the Henneaux-Teitelboim form of UG can be included in a wider class of theories which propagate two (complex) degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: WH+NS系统在多个参数下表现出独特属性，可能为引力物理提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate wormhole-plus-neutron-star (WH+NS) systems supported by two scalar fields, allowing for both pressure anisotropy and magnetic fields. In general, such WH+NS systems contain ghosts; however, these ghosts can be eliminated. We find that neither anisotropy nor magnetic fields affect the traversability of the wormhole. In particular, the null energy condition (NEC) remains violated in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, ensuring the traversable nature of the geometry. For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.

Abstract: We construct a Bohmian quantum cosmological model for a spatially flat Friedmann Robertson Walker universe filled with a single scalar field whose potential provides a unified description of cold dark matter and dark energy at the background level. Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action supplemented by a scalar field, we derive the minisuperspace Lagrangian and the associated canonical Hamiltonian formulation. By means of a nontrivial canonical transformation, the minisuperspace dynamics is mapped into that of a two dimensional hyperbolic oscillator with a fixed frequency ratio, rendering the Wheeler DeWitt equation exactly solvable by separation of variables. The resulting Wheeler-DeWitt solutions are expressed in terms of parabolic cylinder functions and are parametrised by a continuous separation constant, reflecting the constrained nature of the theory and the absence of a standard Schrodinger time parameter. Adopting the de Broglie-Bohm formulation, we derive deterministic guidance equations in minisuperspace and construct a well defined Bohmian Hubble parameter directly in terms of the pilot-wave phase. Finally, we present a Wheeler-DeWitt-derived toy wave function for which the Bohmian trajectories and the associated cosmological expansion history can be obtained analytically, reproducing the late time $Λ$CDM behaviour while exhibiting quantum modifications at earlier epochs.

Abstract: We present an investigation of a static, spherically symmetric Letelier black hole (BH) immersed in an electromagnetic universe (EMU), characterized by the cloud of strings (CoS) parameter $α$ and the EMU parameter $a$. The photon sphere and shadow radius are derived analytically, revealing how both parameters modify the apparent BH silhouette compared to the Schwarzschild case. We extend the shadow analysis to homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma environments, demonstrating systematic reductions in the observed shadow size, and compute the weak gravitational lensing deflection angle in plasma using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The perturbative dynamics are investigated for scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields, with quasinormal mode frequencies obtained via the sixth-order WKB approximation and greybody factors calculated using the rigorous bounds method. The resulting Hawking radiation spectra reveal distinct signatures for bosonic and fermionic emission channels. We further analyze quasi-periodic oscillations by deriving the fundamental orbital frequencies and applying both parametric resonance and relativistic precession models, obtaining constraints from observations.

Abstract: If dark matter is composed of massive bosons, a Bose-Einstein Condensation process must have occurred during the cosmological evolution. Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data. The fit of the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves with the observational data indicate that the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter model gives an acceptable description of the SPARC data, and thus it may be considered as a possible candidate for the in depth understanding of the dark matter properties.

Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe remains one of the most profound puzzles in modern cosmology, often attributed to dark energy within the framework of General Relativity. As an alternative, modified teleparallel gravity theories such as $f(T)$ gravity offer a purely geometric mechanism to explain cosmic acceleration. In this work, we construct a plane-symmetric anisotropic cosmological model in the framework of exponential $f(T)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(T) = T + u e^{-vT}$. A key novelty of this study is that the Hubble function $H(z)$ is derived self-consistently from the field equations rather than being prescribed phenomenologically. Furthermore, we provide the first comprehensive observational test of an anisotropic $f(T)$ model using a combination of DESI, gravitational-wave (GW) data, and complementary datasets including OHD, CMB, and Pantheon+SH0ES. Our best-fit analysis yields $70 \lesssim H_0 \lesssim 73~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $0.28 \lesssim Ω_m \lesssim 0.34$, and $-0.99 \lesssim ω\lesssim -0.69$, all consistent with current late-time cosmological observations. The model accurately reproduces the distance modulus of Type Ia supernovae and the luminosity-distance relation from gravitational-wave standard sirens. These results demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic exponential $f(T)$ model can account for the observed cosmic acceleration without invoking a dark-energy component, thereby offering a novel and observationally consistent framework for studying anisotropic extensions of gravity.

### [272] [The First Model-Independent Upper Bound on Micro-lensing Signature of the Highest Mass Binary Black Hole Event GW231123](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19077)
*Aniruddha Chakraborty,Suvodip Mukherjee*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses a high mass binary black hole merger detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. The event suggests the need for alternative explanations beyond stellar progenitors. Gravitational lensing is a potential explanation, but the analysis using μ-GLANCE finds no strong evidence for it in GW231123. The current systematics in waveform models prevent a definitive conclusion. Future lensed events could be detected with improved models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origin of high mass binary black hole mergers is challenging as stellar mass BHs are rare due to the pair-instability supernova mass gap. Gravitational lensing provides a potential alternative explanation for high inferred masses, and this paper aims to test the hypothesis in a model-independent way.

Method: The study uses the μ-GLANCE technique, a model-independent method that searches for common residual strain patterns across the detector network to detect lensing. A Bayesian framework is employed to infer the lensing signal from the residual strain data of GW231123 and other similar events.

Result: Analysis using μ-GLANCE yields no strong evidence for lensing in GW231123. A potential micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude of less than 0.8 at 95% C.I. is detected, but data systematics from waveform models limit the ability to clearly identify lensing. The current sensitivity of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA does not allow a definitive conclusion on lensing in this event.

Conclusion: While lensing cannot be conclusively ruled out, the paper concludes that more accurate waveform models and upcoming detector sensitivities will make it possible to detect lensed GW signals in the near future. This opens up a new avenue for studying lensed binary black hole mergers and their physical properties.

Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) event, GW231123, is the highest mass binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \texttt{$μ$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models.

Result: 1. 任何静态球面对称的时空，若对其施瓦zschild 或里西-诺ardin施 screams 解进行微扰修正，必存在对数running Love numbers。这对于所有正则 blacks hole 是适用的。2. 扰动性假设的重要性：未假设扰动性，我们可以找到零运行的解，超越经典广相。3. 通过赫偿 metrics 重新审视已有结果，展示了该方法的优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为直接计算对数 running Love numbers 提供了新的途径，具有广泛适用性，尤其在研究黑洞解的扰动行为中。

Abstract: Tidal Love numbers and other response coefficients of black holes sometimes exhibit a logarithmic dependence on scale, or 'running'. We clarify that this coefficient is directly calculable from the structure of the equation obeyed by the field perturbation, and requires no knowledge of the full solution. The derived formula allows us to establish some general results on the existence of logarithmic running. In particular, we show that any static and spherically symmetric spacetime that modifies the Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordström solutions in a perturbative way must have non-zero logarithmic Love numbers. This applies for instance to all regular black hole metrics. On the other hand, our analysis highlights the importance of the perturbativity assumption: without it, we find explicit black hole solutions beyond general relativity with exactly zero running. We also illustrate the advantage of our method by recovering and extending the known results for the Hayward metric.

Abstract: The black hole horizon can induce chaotic motion of particles around the black hole. The original integrable motion of particles can transit to the chaotic motion when approaching black hole horizon. In this work, we consider the black hole background where quantum conformal anomaly correction is taken into account. We use the Poincare section and Lyapunov exponent as representative probes to illustrate chaos. We investigate the effect of anomaly coefficient on the chaos of particles and find that quantum anomaly enhances the chaos of particle motions. As the chaotic orbits of particles can leave an imprint on the gravitational wave signals of the extreme mass ratio inspirals, our results pave the way to detect conformal anomaly effect in actual observations.

Abstract: We systematically investigate static plane symmetric configurations in $f(Q)$ gravity. For vacuum regions, we discuss the constancy of the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ and derive general vacuum solutions, which correspond effectively to Taub-(anti) de Sitter spacetimes with a cosmological constant determined by the specific $f(Q)$ model. By matching a singular thin shell source to the vacuum solutions, we relate the shell's energy density and pressure to the integration constants of the exterior geometry. We also examine a finite-thickness slab as another matter source supporting the vacuum solution. Through numerical analysis of a quadratic model $f(Q)=Q+αQ^2$ with isotropic matter, we show that the maximum pressure inside the slab generally does not coincide with the geometric center. Moreover, a negative $α$ with larger magnitude leads to higher internal pressure and a thicker slab, while models with positive $α$ are incompatible with a self-gravitating slab of positive pressure.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This thesis investigates the physical properties of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, examining their compatibility with the hydrodynamic approach and expanding the understanding of their applicability in General Relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Einstein's equations are complex, necessitating symmetry assumptions for exact solutions. Spherical symmetry is particularly relevant, but the physical interpretation of these solutions, especially perfect fluids, is still a challenge.

Method: The study employs hydrodynamic methods, analyzing different interpretations of perfect fluid solutions and applying them to specific families of solutions. xIdeal, a Mathematica tool, aids in analyzing these solutions.

Result: The thesis identifies regions where these solutions are physically admissible, contributing to the understanding of perfect fluid dynamics in General Relativity.

Conclusion: The research advances the field by providing new insights into the physical viability of perfect fluid solutions under spherical and other symmetries.

Abstract: Einstein's equations of General Relativity form a highly nonlinear system, so most exact solutions rely on symmetry assumptions. Spherically symmetric spacetimes have been particularly important, providing a tractable yet physically rich setting. Despite extensive study, many open questions remain, especially regarding the physical interpretation of perfect fluid solutions. Many such solutions were derived without a specified equation of state or under restrictive or non-physical assumptions, limiting their physical relevance. The aim of this thesis is to study the physical viability of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, with extensions to plane and hyperbolic symmetries.
  The first part reviews the hydrodynamic approach, which interprets a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor as a fluid in local thermal equilibrium. Interpretations as a generic ideal gas, a classical ideal gas, and fluids with transport coefficients are analysed. The framework is extended to the ultrarelativistic Synge gas, and methods to approximate its equation of state are developed.
  These results are applied to three families of solutions: T-models, geodesic R-models with flat synchronisation, and thermodynamic Stephani universes. For each family, general expressions for the fluid flow, energy density, pressure, speed of sound, and admissible thermodynamic schemes are obtained. Physical viability is assessed using standard energy, positivity, and compressibility conditions, with emphasis on compatibility with a generic ideal gas. In all cases, wide spacetime regions are found where the solutions represent physically admissible perfect fluids.
  The thesis concludes with xIdeal, a Mathematica package implementing IDEAL algorithms for the analysis of exact solutions, including spacetime characterisations, a metric database, and examples.

Abstract: We study the interior dynamics of spontaneously scalarized black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar theory with zero cosmological constant, revealing novel critical phenomena. We demonstrate that, for a wide range of scalar-electromagnetic couplings, scalarized black holes possess no smooth inner Cauchy horizon and instead evolve into a spacelike Kasner singularity. The scalar hair triggers a rapid collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon. Near the critical point where scalarized black holes bifurcate from the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, we establish a robust scaling relation between the Kasner parameter and the charge-to-mass ratio of the hairy black hole, opening a new window into the remarkable simplicity underlying black hole interiors.

TL;DR: The paper explores the creation of shadows in generalized black hole spacetimes without photon spheres, using Simpson-Visser regularization, and constrains their parameters using observational data of galactic black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Event Horizon Telescope's observation of the Schwarzschild-like shadow of Sgr A* inspired this work on alternative black hole models lacking photon spheres.

Method: The researchers apply the Simpson-Visser regularization technique to null and charged null singularity metrics to create traversable wormhole or singular spacetimes, then analyze their shadow properties by varying the regularization parameter.

Result: The results show that these regularized spacetimes have shadows that closely resemble the Sgr A* observations. The Schwarzschild-like shadow arises despite the absence of a traditional photon sphere, providing an alternative mechanism for shadow formation. Parameter constraints using Sgr A* and M87 align with classic black hole models but also hint at new phenomena., but the presence of photon spheres is not conclusively excluded.

Conclusion: Alternative black hole models without photon spheres can reproduce the observed black hole shadows, suggesting new possibilities beyond conventional general relativity. However, the absence of a photon sphere does not preclude the existence of photon sphere-like phenomena under specific conditions.

Abstract: Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) indicate that the shadow of the compact object at our Galaxy's center (Sgr A*) closely resembles that of a Schwarzschild black hole. However, identifying the presence and exact location of a photon sphere observationally remains challenging. Motivated by this, we investigate shadow formation in spacetimes that lack a photon sphere by applying the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization technique (originally designed to smooth black hole singularities) to null singularity and charged null singularity metrics. Remarkably, these regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can produce a shadow without a photon sphere. We analyze how the SV regularization parameter influences their geometry and shadow size, and show that the regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can correspond either to two-way traversable wormholes or retain singularities. Our results reveal that shadows arising from these regularized 'null singularity spacetimes' closely mimic those of Schwarzschild and charged black-bounce spacetimes, despite the absence of a photon sphere. We also constrain parameters in these geometries using observational data of Sgr A* and M87.

We present an extended catalog of updated posterior samples, quantify how incorporation of these waveform effects alters inferred source properties relative to previous analyses, and discuss waveform systematics.

Abstract: In this work, we highlight the existence of a lower limit on the tidal deformability parameter $Λ$, determined by the requirement of relativistic causality. Additionally, by considering the upper bound set on compactness, we identify the region within the parameter space of compactness versus tidal deformability, where physically motivated exotic compact objects (ECOs) could potentially reside. Our analysis reveals the presence of a tidal gap between black holes, characterized by vanishing tidal deformability, and physically motivated ECOs. Prompted by this finding, we investigate the possibility that a population of maximally compact exotic objects, described by a linear equation of state (EoS), may simultaneously inhabit the lower mass gap and the sub-solar region, thus qualifying as (primordial) black hole mimickers while distinguishing themselves from the latter by their non-zero tidal deformability. Finally, considering the case of solitonic boson stars as proxies for ECOs described by a linear EoS, we discuss how it is possible to further reduce the lower limit on $Λ$, provided that the strong energy condition is violated (but not the dominant energy condition, and therefore causality).

Abstract: The search for exact solutions describing asymptotically FLRW compact objects in General Relativity (GR) remains a notoriously challenging problem. To a large extent, progress has been restricted to the spherically symmetric sector, with the exception of the Kerr-de Sitter and Thakhurta solutions. In this work, we present two new results that advance the description of axisymmetric compact objects embedded in a cosmological background. We first introduce a new solution-generating technique allowing one to construct non-stationary and axisymmetric solutions of the self-interacting Einstein-Scalar system. Using this method, we present the first exact solution which describes a dynamical axisymmetric black (or white) hole embedded in an expanding or contracting cosmology. We provide a detailed investigation of its properties, and in particular its dynamical trapping (or anti-trapping) horizons. To that end, we use the mean curvature vector (MCV) which stands as a natural generalization of the Kodama vector beyond spherical symmetry. The norm of this vector provides a foliation-independent quantity to locate the trapped/anti-trapped and untrapped regions and characterize the causal nature of a given geometry without specific symmetry requirement. The solution-generating method and the techniques to analyze the new solutions provide new powerful tools to further explore the description and the phenomenology of dynamical compact objects embedded in cosmology, in particular those of primordial black holes.

Motivation: The Kerr solution remains central to GR and its modifications. The challenge lies in finding such exact Kerr-like solutions in modified gravity, which this work addresses and contributes to the field by offering a theoretical tool for exploring deviations in GR.

Method: The solution is constructed through a disformal transformation on a Kerr stealth black hole within a Horndeski scalar-tensor theory. The disformal transformation preserves circularity, ensuring the geometrical and physical properties retained from the Kerr solution.

Result: The Circular Disformal Kerr (CDK) solution provides a rare, exact Kerr-like black hole in modified gravity, with properties closely resembling the standard Kerr geometry, simplifying the investigation of alternative gravitational theories' predictions for astrophysical phenomena and tests of gravity via gravitational waves and imaging.

Conclusion: This work advances the understanding of alternative gravity theories by providing a concrete example of a Kerr-like solution. The talk discusses its implications for testing modifications of GR and exploring new phenomena, while highlighting its potential to inspire alternative models and inspire future studies in this area.

Abstract: The Kerr solution is the cornerstone of General Relativity (GR) for modelling astrophysical rotating black holes and for testing GR through gravitational-wave observations and black hole imaging. Understanding how the Kerr geometry is modified in alternative theories of gravity is therefore a crucial step toward constraining possible deviations from GR. Despite their importance, exact analytical solutions describing rotating black holes in modified gravity are rare, limiting our ability to explore novel phenomenology and to design robust observational tests of new physics. In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric. The spacetime is algebraically general, corresponding to Petrov type I. This new exact solution therefore provides a rare example of a rotating black hole beyond GR that closely mimics the Kerr geometry, offering a valuable theoretical laboratory to investigate the phenomenology of Kerr-like black holes in modified gravity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, two models of metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame are investigated as a dynamical description of the late-time cosmic expansion using binned Type~Ia Supernovae data. The aim is to provide an explanation for the effective running of the Hubble constant observed in both the binned Pantheon Sample and the Master Sample. To this end, the effective running Hubble constant $\mathcal{H}(z)$ is defined as the ratio between the modified Hubble parameter and that of the standard cosmological model ($Λ$CDM), multiplied by $H_0$. $\mathcal{H}(z)$ serves as a diagnostic tool to capture deviations from the $Λ$CDM model.
  The first model used is a general representation of metric $f(R)$ gravity in which the gravitational Lagrangian is encoded in an effective redshift-dependent function that mimics the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Due to the limited redshift range covered by the available Supernovae Data, this function can be reliably approximated by a second-order Taylor expansion.
  While this more general formulation yields a phenomenological fit that is compatible with that of the $Λ$CDM for the binned Pantheon Sample, the model is not physically viable, as it generically leads to the emergence of an unphysical mass of the scalar field. This issue originates from an implicit restriction imposed on the Cauchy problem for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. To address this limitation, following previous studies, an additional condition on the modified Friedmann equation is introduced, enabling a fully consistent reformulation of the dynamics. The resulting framework not only preserves the agreement with Supernova~Ia data, but also provides a physical justification for the additional condition adopted in earlier analyses of late-time cosmological dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz violation on the internal structure of mini-boson stars and the resulting gravitational-wave signals from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within the framework of bumblebee gravity. Numerical solutions for static, spherically symmetric configurations reveal that a positive Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$ suppresses repulsive pressure, thereby enhancing gravitational binding and yielding more compact boson stars. Conversely, a negative $\ell$ amplifies repulsive pressure and weakens gravitational binding, such that no static solutions exist beyond a critical negative value. These structural modifications imprint distinct features on EMRI dynamics, characterized by a monotonic decrease in both orbital eccentricity and radial range as $\ell$ increases. Unlike the intermittent bursts from grazing orbits that resemble black-hole signals, penetrating orbits that enter the boson-star core exhibit sustained, amplitude-modulated gravitational-wave signatures without quiet intervals. Their characteristic strain falls within the detectability range of LISA, providing a potential observable for constraining Lorentz violation.

Abstract: We investigate energy bounds and the stability of stationary asymptotically flat spacetimes with an ergoregion and no future horizon in the context of Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar field models which naturally arise in Kaluza-Klein and String theories. In order to do that we consider scalar field perturbations non-minimally coupled to a background electromagnetic field. We show that there is compactly supported initial data such that the initial energy flux across the initial Cauchy hypersurface is negative and that the energy flux decreases with time. Then, considering arguments due to J. Friedman and G. Moschidis, this indicates that the energy flux diverges for those solutions and such spacetimes with an ergoregion are unstable.
