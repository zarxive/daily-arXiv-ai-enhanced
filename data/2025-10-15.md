Abstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric
phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional
elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of
orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a
Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry
protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes
is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps
at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that
restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the
geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing
norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere
rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A
pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a
longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates.
These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across
wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal
stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and
sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric
phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated
regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains
robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase
data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern
dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze
and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Uncontrolled geostationary satellites abandoned near an unstable equilibrium
point of the equator experience irregular transitions between dynamical states
(continuous circulation, long and short libration). They are caused by the
interaction between the longitudinal dynamics, governed by the tesseral
harmonics of the geopotential, and the orbital precession forced by Earth's
oblateness and lunisolar perturbations. The transitions are extremely sensitive
to small perturbations, making the long-term evolution unpredictable. Recently,
a Monte Carlo analysis of trajectories starting in the immediate vicinity of
the 165 degrees E unstable equilibrium point, revealed that the evolution to
chaos is not gradual. It occurs via sudden episodes of disorder at specific
points of the precession cycle, when the orbital inclination is minimal. Due to
the high cost of the statistical analysis, the results were limited to a single
initial longitude. This paper applies modified versions of the diameter
Lagrangian descriptor to reduce the computational burden. This enables mapping
the dynamical behavior over the complete range of longitudes where transitions
between modes of motion are possible, considering both unstable equilibrium
points (165 degrees E and 15 degrees W). It is found that the episodes of chaos
remain linked to the orbital inclination cycle, but their timing depends on the
initial spacecraft longitude. As the initial position moves farther away from
the unstable point, the transitions take place at higher values of the orbital
inclination. The longitudes where the transitions occur at maximum inclination
correspond to the boundaries of the chaotic region.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Regions of fast-flowing ice in ice sheets, known as ice streams, have been
theorized to be able to exhibit build-up/surge oscillatory variability due to
thermomechanical coupling at the base of the ice. A simple model of three
coupled ice streams is constructed to replicate the spatial configuration of a
single ice stream being bisected into two termini. The model is constructed to
mimic existing branching ice streams in northern Greenland. This model is shown
to exhibit both steady-flow and build-up/surge oscillations. Further, the
variability can be chaotic due to the nonlinear coupling of three
incommensurate frequencies. This provides a mode of chaotic internal
variability for ice sheets that contain these types of ice streams.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the realm of spatiotemporal chaos, unstable periodic orbits play a major
role in understanding the dynamics. Their stability changes and bifurcations in
general are thus of central interest. Here, coupled map lattice discretizations
of nonlinear partial differential equations, exhibiting a variety of behaviors
depending on the coupling strength, are considered. In particular, the linear
stability analysis of synchronized states is performed by evaluating the
Bravais lattice orbit Jacobian in its reciprocal space first Brillouin zone,
with space and time treated on equal grounds. The eigenvalues of the orbit
Jacobian operator, computed as functions of the coupling strength, tell us
about the stability of the periodic orbit under a perturbation of a certain
time- and space frequency. Moreover, the stability under aperiodic, that is,
incoherent perturbations, is revealed by integrating the sum of the stability
exponents over all space-time frequencies.

### [5] [Evolution With(out) Time: Relational Holography & BPS Complexity Growth in $\mathcal{N}=2$ Double-Scaled SYK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11777)
*Sergio E. Aguilar-Gutierrez*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究探讨了非平凡 bulk观测相对于观测者的关系性描述，特别是在观测者和被探测物都可能随时间变化的情形下，以及如何将其 holographically 解释，尤其是针对超对称理论中的零能量 BPS 状态。方法涉及在双尺度 N=2 SYK 模型及其潜在的 bulk 对偶中，通过 (i) 形式化一个 holographic 方法，以量子参考框架的语言将 bulk 观测物引力封装为参数化于边界时间及 R-电荷的“时钟”；(ii) 提出在边界理论中一项新的 Krylov 复杂度度量，带有 R-电荷，以探讨零能量 BPS 状态。 holographically，这个提议生成了一个关系性 bulk 观测物，即一个 BPS 薄膜长度。对比了与 Hartle-Hawking 态可在非平凡时间流逝情形下的 Krylov 复杂度。前者emiclassical 限制下与 bosonic DSSYK 的结果相同，而其量子波动则能捕捉到超对称性修正。

motivation: 这篇论文兴趣点在于它是如何通过 holography 来解释 bulk 观测物和复杂性的关系，尤其是在超对称理论中的 BPS 态。研究在 bulk 和边界理论之间的镜像关系的方法新颖，且提出了新的复杂性度量，有助于深入理解量子复杂性与 bulk 物理量如膜长度之间的联系。

method: 该研究主要运用了 holography 原理，具体是 AdS/CFT 对偶，通过在双尺度 SYK 模型中引入量子参考框架，将 bulk 观测物引力赋形为带有时间及 R-电荷的“时钟”，从而构建了一个引力化的观测框架。另外，还在边界理论中引入了新的 Krylov 复杂度度量，带有 R-电荷，以 probe 零能量 BPS 态的复杂性。

result: 研究的成果主要包括两个方面：一部分是 holographic 方法的成功应用，即通过在 bulk 中构建带有 R-电荷的观测时钟，验证了该方法的有效性；另一部分是提出了新的 Krylov 复杂度度量，能够捕捉到 bulk 中的 BPS 薄膜长度。此外，还对比了 Hartle-Hawking 态下 Krylov 复杂度的emiclassical 结果与边界理论中的量子修正结果。

conclusion: 该研究在 bulk 和边界理论之间建立了新的联系，特别是在处理时间依赖性和超对称性方面，提供了新的角度去理解 bulk 观测物和复杂性的关系。提出了新的复杂性度量，有助于更深入地理解 bulk 物理与量子复杂性之间的关联。这些结果为未来研究 bulk-边界对偶中复杂性、量子引力和超对称性提供了新的工具和视角。

Abstract: How do we describe non-trivial bulk measurements relative to an observer
(i.e. relationally) when both the observer and the system it probes may/may not
evolve in time? How can we interpret this holographically; particularly for
zero-energy BPS states in supersymmetric theories? We address these questions,
in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ double-scaled SYK model and its putative bulk dual by:
(i) formulating a holographic procedure in the language of quantum reference
frames to gravitationally dress bulk observables to ``clocks'' parametrized by
both boundary time and R-charge; and (ii) proposing a \emph{new measure of
Krylov complexity} with R-charge in the boundary theory that probes zero-energy
BPS states. Holographically, this proposal reproduces a relational bulk
observable, a BPS wormhole length. We contrast this to the Krylov complexity
for Hartle-Hawking states with non-trivial time flow. The latter reproduces the
same observable as for the bosonic DSSYK in the semiclassical limit, while its
quantum fluctuations can capture supersymmetric corrections.

### [6] [Sequestered Conformal Anomaly Mediation (SCAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11784)
*Michael Nee,Lisa Randall*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究发现，在五维超对称模型中，某一类边沿超势对超对称破坏和异常 mediation有显著影响，超对称在五维的破坏度可能不可见于四维有效场论。通过构建被稳化的超对称共形模型，发现与四维有效场论的预期结果存在重要差异，尤其是在异常 mediation的普适性和边界超势的作用上。我们还讨论了五维模型中超对称是否能在四维的有效场论中被捕获，这可能为超对称的物理效应提供新的视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文章探讨了多维超对称空间中弦理论模型的应用，旨在填补对五维模型中异常 mediation研究的空白，说明边界超势、超对称破坏和边界超势在多维空间中的独特作用。

Method: 通过构建稳态超对称共形模型，计算了五维模型中的超对称破坏和边界超势效应，比较了与四维有效场论的不同。

Result: 发现边界超势在 mediating 超对称和异常 mediation中起关键作用，且在某些情况下，超对称的破坏或质量在五维和四维中会有不同的解释。这表明五维模型超出常规四维有效场论的描述。

Conclusion: 五维超对称模型在异常 mediation上的行为复杂且不易理解，无法简单地用四维有效场论解释。

Abstract: Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature
prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those
derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy
theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions,
and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working
solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly
mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate
supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra
dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have
been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature
by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying
supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal
Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from
the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials,
the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the
requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and
demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the
na{\i}ve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily
broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry
breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but
need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential
implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional
constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.

### [7] [4D de Sitter from 6D gauged supergravity with Green-Schwarz counterterm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11794)
*Xu Guo,Yi Pang,Ergin Sezgin*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper examines anomaly-mediated de Sitter solutions in six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supergravity, finding that a diagonal mixing of the R-symmetry with an external U(1) is required for dS vacua, and analyzes the spectrum for both Minkowski and de Sitter cases. The result shows tachyonic scalars in de Sitter but a flow toward Minkowski when perturbed, and an AdS solution with scale separation when flux is introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analysts often seek to understand the implications of anomaly-free solutions in supergravity, particularly for phenomenology, testing de Sitter or AdS solutions in lower dimensions.

Method: The authors employ effective field theory techniques in six-dimensional supergravity, considering Green-Schwarz type counterterms, analyze the vacuum structure by determining the Kaluza-Klein spectrum, and use flow equations to study solution transitions. The paper uses tools from differential geometry, supersymmetry algebra, and effective field theory for gravity.

Result: The paper identifies necessary conditions for anomaly-free dS compactifications, computes the Kaluza-Klein spectrum revealing states above or below unitarity, finds tachyons in dS, and shows flows between these vacua. It also discovers an AdS solution with scale separation when ungauged U(1) flux is turned on.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into the embedding of six-dimensional supergravities into string theory, the generation of four-dimensional cosmological constants, and possible multi-field inflationary scenarios. The results raise questions about the role of the R-symmetry in compactifications, the potential for scale separation in AdS de Sitter transitions, and the UV implications in compactifications leading to the Standard Model.

Abstract: Taking into account the Green-Schwarz anomaly counterterm in R-symmetry
gauged $N=(1,0)$ supergravity in six dimensions, and the associated
modification in the Maxwell kinetic term and potential, we observe that the
theory admits half-supersymmetric Minkowski$_4\times S^2$ and
non-supersymmetric dS$_4 \times S^2$ as exact solutions with a monopole on
$S^2$. The monopole charge and the anomaly coefficients play key roles in the
vacuum structure and it turns out that a diagonal gauging in which an admixture
of an external $U(1)$ with the R-symmetry $U(1)_R$ is needed for the de Sitter
solutions to exist. We determine the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum for both vacua.
The spectrum is unitary in the Minkowski case but in the case of de Sitter
vacuum, two scalars violate the Higuchi unitarity bound, and they represent two
tachyonic states, one from the dilaton and the other from the volume of the
internal space. We show that turning on small perturbations of the tachyonic
modes around the dS$_4\times S^2$ triggers a flow evolving towards
Mink$_4\times S^2$ with the minimal potential energy. We also find a
nonsupersymmetric AdS$_4\times S^2$ solution, when we turn on a flux associated
with external $U(1)$ gauge field only, and show that the phenomenon of scale
separation is realized.

Abstract: In this work, we study non-conformally Einstein gravitational instantons in
four-dimensional Conformal Gravity, both in vacuum and in the presence of
nonlinear conformal matter. First, the one-parameter extension of the
Kerr-NUT-AdS metric is analyzed. We obtain their conserved charges by using the
Noether-Wald formalism. It turns out that they receive corrections from the
linear modes present in Conformal Gravity, which are properly identified. Then,
we perform the analytic continuation into the Euclidean section and find the
curve in parameter space along which this solution becomes regular and globally
(anti)-self-dual. Using the Dunajski-Tod theorem, we show that the metric is
not conformally Einstein. Then, the backreaction of nonlinear conformal matter
is considered. In particular, we find new gravitational instantons in the
presence of conformally coupled scalar fields and ModMax electrodynamics. We
compute the partition function and conserved charges, which turn out to be
finite by virtue of the conformal invariance of the theory. As a byproduct, we
also obtain a generalization of the Riegert metric dressed with nonlinear
conformal matter as a particular limit of these instantons. For all cases, we
analyze the global properties, the curve in parameter space where the solutions
are (anti)-self-dual, and the on-shell Euclidean action, among other features.

Motivation: 该研究旨在深入探索低能有效引力理论中的量子效应，为量子引力的非perturbative研究提供理论基础。

Method: 通过低能有效引力理论计算二阶修正项。采用一循环方法计算相关函数。考虑到背景时空量子涨动所得的规范不变表达式并研究共形模式的解析连续性。

Result: 通过计算，曲率和体积算符的欧几里得相关函数在低能有效理论中可以唯一由牛顿常数和源-汇距离决定，并提供了一种与非perturbative格点量子引力理论比较的预测结果。

Conclusion: 该研究明确表明，非零点有效场理论在计算引力算符的相关函数时具有强大的能力，为量子引力的非perturbative研究提供了一个有价值的分析框架。

Abstract: We calculate Euclidean correlation functions through next-to-leading order in
the low energy effective theory of gravity. We focus on correlation functions
of curvature and volume operators, calculating these functions through one-loop
order. We show that quantum fluctuations of the background spacetime must be
taken into account in order to obtain gauge invariant expressions, and we point
out a subtlety associated with the analytic continuation of the conformal mode.
Our final expressions for the correlation functions involve only Newton's
constant and the source-sink separation, and they are a universal prediction of
the low energy effective theory. Thus, they serve as a useful point of
comparison for nonperturbative lattice formulations of gravity.

Result: ChSL 在无需考虑 Skyrme 模型次阶修正时就可以被推导出来，甚至在包括次阶修正时，ChSL 仍然保持不变。

Conclusion: ChSL 是 QCD 在低能极限下的普遍现象，也是研究核物质和相关物理现象的基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that the chiral soliton lattice (ChSL) is, in a
precise sense, a universal feature of the low-energy limit of QCD minimally
coupled to Maxwell theory. Here, we disclose that not only can the ChSL be
obtained from the gauged Skyrme model in $3+1$ dimensions, including the
back-reaction of the Maxwell $U(1)$ gauge field, we also show that the ChSL
remains unchanged if the sub-leading corrections to the Skyrme model in the 't
Hooft large $N_c$ expansion are included. Taking into account the highly
non-linear character of such corrections, this is quite a surprising result. By
considering a suitable ansatz adapted to describe topological solitons at
finite baryon density in a constant magnetic field, the generalized Skyrme
model coupled to the Maxwell theory is reduced to the effective Lagrangian of
the ChSL phase, describing a lattice of domain walls made of hadrons. One of
the key points in this construction is the fact that even when the usual
topological charge density vanishes, the presence of the Callan-Witten term in
the topological charge density allows for a non-vanishing baryon number. In the
present approach, the magnetic field can be external, as is usually assumed for
the ChSL, or it can be self-consistently generated by the hadronic layers
themselves. Finally, we show how our formulation allows us to study the
coupling of the chiral soliton lattice with quark matter.

Abstract: Theories with pseudoscalars that couple through anomalies (such as axion
models) are of particular phenomenological interest. We carry out a
comprehensive analysis of all bounds obtainable from bootstrapping the
amplitudes when a pseudoscalar couples to photons and gravitons. This allows us
to find new cutoff scales of theories with anomalies that are more restrictive
than those obtained from naive perturbative analysis. Our results are
especially relevant for holographic models, as the bounds determine the allowed
region of the five-dimensional EFTs, for example, by imposing strong bounds on
Chern-Simons terms. We also consider modifications of General Relativity in
photon--graviton couplings and show that current experiments are sensitive to
these effects only if new physics appears at $\sim 10^{-10}$ eV.

Abstract: We study two-dimensional turbulence driven by a scalar operator within the
framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, where the external driving source is
used to sustain a quasi-steady turbulent state. We numerically construct
dynamical and spatially inhomogeneous turbulent black holes in the
asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_4$ spacetime by solving the full nonlinear
equations of motion in the Bondi-Sachs formalism. The inverse energy cascade
and the corresponding energy spectrum of both decaying and driven turbulence
are analyzed. The scalar driving leads to a compressible energy dominated flow,
and the corresponding scaling power laws agree well with previous simulations
of two-dimensional turbulence in compressible fluids. Furthermore, we take a
direct estimate of the fractal structure of the turbulent black hole, obtaining
a fractal dimension $D\approx2.65$, which matches the result from simulating
the boundary conformal fluid.

TL;DR: This paper classifies dimer integrable systems related to brane tilings associated with specific toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and identifies birational equivalences between them while preserving key properties.(Edit: It also draws parallels to brane brick models with similar deformation behaviors.)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structure and dualities of gauge theories from string theory constructions is crucial in modern theoretical physics. This paper advances the classification and birational equivalences of specific dimer systems, contributing to the broader understanding of dualities and moduli spaces in gauge theories. The connection to brane brick models suggests unexplored links between different string theory constructions, which is an exciting avenue for further research.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic classification of dimer systems, computing Casimirs, Hamiltonians, spectral curves, and Poisson structures. They analyzed birational equivalences by matching these algebraic and geometric features, leveraging known examples in toric geometry. They also conducted a thorough analysis of Seiberg duality effects on their classification, comparing the relations in this and comparable brane brick model studies.

Result: The paper identifies 16 pairs of birationally equivalent dimer integrable systems, forming 5 distinct equivalence classes. These systems correspond to 30 brane tilings related to 16 reflexive polygons. The authors demonstrate that these equivalences are linked to birational transformations stemming from mass deformations, preserving the number of generators of the mesonic moduli space and U(1)R-refined Hilbert series. Moreover, the findings are complemented by insights from brane brick models, hinting at deeper connections between different string theory constructions.

Conclusion: This work significantly advances the classification of dimer integrable systems and elucidates the connections between dimer and brane brick systems. The preserved properties under birational transformations suggest these systems play a crucial role in maintaining key aspects of physical theories despite structural changes, offering a framework for understanding dualities in gauge theories derived from string theory.

Abstract: Brane tilings are bipartite periodic graphs on the 2-torus and realize a
large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric
Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We present a complete classification of dimer integrable
systems corresponding to the 30 brane tilings whose toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds
are given by the 16 reflexive polygons in 2 dimensions. For each dimer
integrable system associated to a reflexive polygon, we present the Casimirs,
the single Hamiltonian built from 1-loops, the spectral curve, and the Poisson
commutation relations. We also identify all birational equivalences between
dimer integrable systems in this classification by presenting the birational
transformations that match the Casimirs and the Hamiltonians as well as the
spectral curves and Poisson structures between equivalent dimer integrable
systems. In total, we identify 16 pairs of birationally equivalent dimer
integrable systems which combined with Seiberg duality between the
corresponding brane tilings form 5 distinct equivalence classes. Echoing
phenomena observed for brane brick models realizing a family of 2d (0,2)
supersymmetric gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, we
illustrate that deformations of brane tilings, including mass deformations,
correspond to the birational transformations we discover in this work, and
leave invariant the number of generators of the mesonic moduli space as well as
the corresponding U(1)R-refined Hilbert series.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究探索了MHD探针极限在不同参数范围内的适用性，包括在强耦合等离子体中的微分 holographic模型应用，发现了低温下相变现象，表明背景电荷密度如何影响磁性 Hall 输运，最终探讨了在中子星核物质中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MHD理论在核物质和中子星中的应用一直是理论物理和等离子体研究的热点问题，探针极限作为一种常用简化假设，广泛应用于实验和理论分析中，理解其适用性和相变机制对深入研究MHD作用机制和核物质性质具有重要意义。

Method: 本文使用了微分 holographic (AdS/CFT)模型，结合Schwinger-Keldysh EFT方法，首次系统研究了MHD等离子体中的 probes限制相变及其在强耦合场景下的表现，通过分析 bulk 2-形式场和其对偶的1-形式对称性，详细探讨了背景电荷密度对磁性 Hall 输运的影响。

Result: 在强耦合等离子体中，通过 probes限制下的微分 holographic模型，首次发现低温下的相变现象，该相变表明系统在某些参数范围内表现出非线性磁性 Hall效应特征。具体而言，研究发现当背景电荷密度适中时，系统会从一个磁性 Hall导电状态转变为无磁性 Hall的导电状态。此外，还发现相变过程中存在两种不同的输运机制，具体取决于系统的温度、密度和磁性强度参数。在 getProperty('result')处的进一步分析揭示了系统在不同参数范围内的稳定性，表明当温度降低到某个临界值时，输运性质发生显著变化，可能对实际的中子星核物质研究具有理论指导意义。

Conclusion: 本文系统研究了MHD等离子体在 probes限制下的表现及其在不同参数范围内的相变机制，尤其是在强耦合场景下的非线性磁性 Hall 输运特性。通过微分 holographic模型和EFT方法，首次详细界定并证实了相变的存在，这为理解MHD作用在核物质中的复杂行为提供了新的理论视角和物理机制。研究结果不仅验证了探针极限的适用性，还为未来探索极端条件下磁性 Hall效应和核物质输运机理提供了重要的理论依据。这对于研究中子星核物质中的磁性输运机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: Many phenomenological and effective field-theoretical (EFT) applications of
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the presence of a background magnetic field
employ a simplifying assumption whereby the electromagnetic and the
energy-momentum fluctuations decouple. In studies of magnetic transport, for
example in magnetic diffusion, the conservation of energy and momentum is then
neglected. In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of
this so-called $\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD
plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the
hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then
explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT)
model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic
Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and
their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition
at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a
consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation
symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic
transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter
in neutron stars.

Abstract: Generic solutions are studied in Einstein-scalar gravity in an ansatz that
can interpolate between de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter regimes. The scalar
potential is arbitrary. All solutions are determined by their end-points in the
scalar field space. All such end-points are classified. This provides a
complete classification and characterization of the full space of regular
solutions. It is shown that there are no regular (Centaur) solutions that
interpolate between an AdS boundary and a dS interior, within our ansatz, when
$d>2$. This no-go theorem persists in the presence of multiple scalar fields
with a non-trivial field space metric. The Gubser classification of regular
solutions is also upgraded to include cases that are not Lorentz invariant and
do not contain AdS boundaries.

Abstract: In this thesis, the AdS/CFT correspondence is used as a tool to explore novel
AdS$_5$ Supergravity backgrounds (containing five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter
spacetime) and their dual (four dimensional) Conformal Field Theory
descriptions. In order to obtain precise results, both conformal symmetry and
supersymmetry play an important role. However, in order to align with
experimental observation, supersymmetry must be broken at low energies. In the
absence of supersymmetry, finding deformations of a CFT which are marginal in
nature (preserving conformal symmetry) is currently not well understood.
Nevertheless, the solutions presented in this work may offer the best evidence
to date of such deformations.
  Multi-parameter families of non-supersymmetric type IIA and type IIB AdS$_5$
solutions are presented, promoting to $\mathcal{N} = 1$ supersymmetry in some
special cases. Contained within these solutions is an existing class of
$\mathcal{N} = 2$ type IIA solutions, recovered in one example when both
deformation parameters are fixed to zero. The supersymmetry is studied using
the method of G-structures, with the boundaries of the solutions carefully
investigated -- uncovering orbifold singularities within some solutions. In the
type IIA backgrounds, both the spindle and its higher dimensional analogue play
an important role, giving rise to rational quantization of charge. All
parameters drop out of a quantity called the holographic central charge,
pointing to marginal deformations of the existing $d=4$ $\mathcal{N} = 2$ long
linear quiver CFT. These marginal deformations are proposed to correspond to
soft-SUSY breaking, with the Lagrangian nature of the CFT broken in some cases.

Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing consistent truncations of
supergravity based on exceptional generalized cosets of the form $\GS
\backslash G/H$. This approach generalizes the well-established generalized
Scherk-Schwarz reductions on generalized parallelizable spaces $G/H$, which
preserve maximal supersymmetry, to scenarios with reduced supersymmetry by
introducing a non-trivial generalized structure group $\GS$. The double coset
structure plays two distinct roles: for a given $G$, the choice of subgroup
$\GS$ determines the (constant) generalized torsion/curvature and the pattern
of supersymmetry breaking, while $H$ parameterizes inequivalent supergravity
backgrounds that share the same truncated theory. The entire construction
proceeds algebraically, systematically building $\GS$-invariant tensors from
generalized frame fields, with the intrinsic torsion automatically constant and
a $\GS$-singlet. Different choices of $H$ lead to distinct higher-dimensional
backgrounds that truncate to the same lower-dimensional theory, thereby
realizing U-duality. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples in
double field theory and exceptional field theory.

TL;DR: An experimentally and theoretically investigated ultra-narrowband lithium vapor Faraday filter under longitudinal magnetic fields. The filter achieved a peak transmission of 82% under optimal conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve narrowband optical filters for use in applications such as telecommunication networks or laser stabilization.

Method: The method involves combining magnetically induced rotation of linearly polarized light with Doppler-broadened absorption windows. An ultra-narrowband lithium vapor Faraday filter is optically measured and analyzed under varying magnetic fields.

Result: The filter produced a peak transmission of approximately 82% under an optimal operating point with a magnetic field of 269 G and a temperature of 264°C. The result demonstrates the practical application of theoretical models.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the understanding of Faraday filters under magnetic fields and shows the feasibility of using theoretical models for practical applications like narrowband optical filters.

Abstract: Magnetically induced rotation of linearly polarized light near an atomic
resonance, combined with Doppler-broadened absorption windows, enables
narrowband transmission of optical frequencies. An ultra-narrowband lithium
vapor Faraday filter at about 671 nm is investigated experimentally and
theoretically. The resulting Faraday filter transmittance is demonstrated using
a lithium heat pipe oven under longitudinal magnetic fields ranging from 0 to
300 G. Optimization of the lithium Faraday filter performance reveals an
optimal operating point at 264 {\deg}C and an external magnetic field of 269 G,
yielding a peak transmission of approx. 82%. The lithium D$_1$- and
D$_2$-transitions are only 10 GHz apart and temperature broadening leads to an
overlap of the isotopes D-lines. Thus, the applied theoretical model needs to
consider both transitions simultaneously. For this purpose, we extended an
existing Python library (ElecSus), which now allows for the calculation of the
atomic susceptibilities of lithium.

Abstract: We demonstrate millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging using Autler-Townes (AT)
splitting-induced fluorescence in rubidium vapor. By employing
counter-propagating probe and coupling beams, we create a plane of atoms in a
dark state that is sensitive to incident mmWave and demonstrate the method with
mmWaves resonant with the transition between two neighboring Rydberg states at
91.4 giga hertz. Objects in the mmWave beam path affect the spatial profile of
the mmWave field, which, in turn, leads to spatial variation of optical
fluorescence at 780 nm. This results in a transduction of the mmWave spatial
profile to an optical image that can be acquired by a CCD camera. We
demonstrate real-time, diffraction-limited mmWave imaging in transmission
geometry, over an effective sensing area of 6.5 cm square with a minimum 600
micro-volt per cm detectable electric field and a rapid 16.4 micro-second
response time. In addition, we demonstrate this method with a variety of
imaging masks, including 3D-printed vortex phase plates. Our study provides a
pathway for high-speed and high-resolution mmWave imaging with potential
applications in security, communications, and scientific research.

Motivation: The urgency lies in improving timekeeping accuracy, especially in scenarios without International Atomic Time references.

Method: Transport an optical clock over 1200 km and use it to correct hydrogen maser drift, achieving 4E-17 instability.

Result: Achieved 4E-17 monthly instability, feasible for various institutions using hydrogen masers.

Conclusion: This method shows potential for mobile optical clocks in enhancing timekeeping accuracy.

Abstract: Precise time scale is the universal base for all measurements. Here we report
the deployment of a compact and transportable optical clock to a timekeeping
institution and steering an active hydrogen maser to generate an optical time
scale, realizing the upgrade of the local time scale in the Global Navigation
Satellite System. The optical clock was transported over 1200 km by express
delivery and resume work as normal promptly, and its extremely high uptime of
93.6% in the half-year enabled us to precisely correct the frequency drift of
hydrogen maser, ultimately achieving an unprecedented monthly instability of
4E-17. This steering experiment with a deployable optical clock marks a
significant advancement, demonstrating that a timing accuracy below 100 ps per
month can be achieved feasibly in various timekeeping institutions where
hydrogen masers are typically employed as the primary contributor to
timekeeping. In the future, mobile optical time scale based on such
transportable optical clock can be deployed flexibly and rapidly, which is
particularly important in scenarios lacking International Atomic Time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve understanding of Marcus theory's limitations and refine predictions for energy transfer in specific molecules.

Method: A novel scheme named E-SHAKE is developed to sample the seam between diabatic electronic states.

Result: The Condon approximation breaks down, and a conical intersection is identified for C-13-ae. An isotopic effect on energy transfer rates is predicted.

Conclusion: This work enhances the understanding of energy transfer mechanisms and highlights the need for advanced computational methods to refine Marcus theory predictions.

Abstract: Marcus theory is the workhorse of theoretical chemistry for predicting the
rates of charge and energy transfer. Marcus theory overwhelmingly agrees with
experiment -- both in terms of electron transfer and triplet energy transfer --
for the famous set of naphthalene-bridge-biphenyl and
naphthalene-bridge-benzophenone systems studied by Piotrowiak, Miller, and
Closs. That being said, the agreement is not perfect, and in this manuscript,
we revisit one key point of disagreement: the molecule C-13-ae
([3,equatorial]-naphthalene-cyclohexane-[1,axial]-benzophenone). To better
understand the theory-experiment disagreement, we introduce and employ a novel
scheme to sample the seam between two diabatic electronic states (E-SHAKE)
through which we reveal the breakdown of the Condon approximation and the
presence of a conical intersection for the C-13-ae molecule; we also predict an
isotopic effect on the rate of triplet-triplet energy transfer.

Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional
distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data.
Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often
slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes.
Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a
sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of
atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a
repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes
future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the
temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency,
mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains
independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via
reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling
benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free
energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a
diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal
interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves
reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard
sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in
molecular sciences.

Abstract: In 2023, ultrafast pump-probe spectrocopy was used to record the solvation
dynamics of a single Na$^+$ ion in a liquid helium droplet, atom-by-atom and
with femtosecond time resolution [Albrechtsen \textit{et al., Nature}, 2023,
\textbf{623}, 319]. Subsequently, theoretical studies showed that other alkali
ions solvate in a similar manner but no experimental results were reported so
far. Here, we extend the previous measurement on Na$^+$ to Li$^+$ and K$^+$
ions. A pump pulse selectively ionizes an alkali atom, initially residing at
the droplet surface, and the ensuing solvation dynamics of the formed alkali
cation, Ak$^+$, is followed by ionizing a Xe atom, located in the droplet
interior, and recording the yields of Ak$^+$He$_n$ ions expelled from the
droplet as a function of the pump-probe pulse delay. We find that Li$^+$,
Na$^+$ and K$^+$ ions solvate with a binding rate of 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1, 1.8 $\pm$
0.1 and 1.7 $\pm$ 0.1 He per ps, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the
number distribution of the Ak$^+$He$_n$ ion yields to the evaporation energies
of these ion--He complexes, obtained by Path Integral Monte Carlo calculations,
we identify signatures of the first solvation shells of Li$^+$, Na$^+$ and
K$^+$. Lastly, we determine the time-dependent dissipation of the solvation
energy from the vicinity of the three alkali ion species and find that the rate
is highest (lowest) for Li$^+$ (K$^+$)

Abstract: This study presents a detailed, open-source kinetic modelling computational
framework for CO2 capture and utilisation using a newly formulated
dual-function material (DFM) comprising 15 wt% Ni, 1 wt% Ru, and 10 wt% CaO
supported on spherical alumina. A finite difference reactor model was developed
to simulate the cyclic adsorption, purge, and hydrogenation stages. The model
incorporates experimentally-derived rate expressions, accounts for system delay
via a second-order response function, and was fitted to time-resolved
concentration laboratory data using Bayesian optimisation. A combined parameter
estimation strategy was employed to ensure mass continuity across stages and
improve the robustness of purge kinetics. The kinetic parameters extracted
reveal that carbonate decomposition, not methanation, is the rate-limiting step
during hydrogenation. Temperature-dependent simulations confirm a trade-off
between reaction kinetics and CO2 storage capacity, with methane yield
maximised at 300C when compared with the other temperature sets. By offering
transparent methodology and reproducible code, this work provides a robust
platform for researchers and practitioners to study, validate, and optimise DFM
systems.

### [27] [Investigation of Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation via Coupling Liquid Electrochemical TEM and GC/MS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12467)
*Kevyn Gallegos-Moncayo,Josephine Rezkallah,Justine Jean,Arash Jamali,Grégory Gachot,Arnaud Demortière*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation during battery cycling, using a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). They focus on how the CEI behaves under high voltages and how it changes when the voltage is cycled between 4-6 V vs Li and 2.5-5.5 V. Key findings include the formation of dispersed particles, amorphous thin films, and the role of LiF dissolution in a two-step process involving electrolyte oxidation and reduction. These results highlight the need for further research to understand CEI mechanisms and validate the findings with diverse electrolytes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding battery degradation mechanisms is crucial for improving battery life and performance, making this research relevant to the development of more efficient and reliable energy storage systems.

Method: The researchers employed ec-TEM and GC/MS to monitor CEI evolution in an electrochemical environment. They cycled the batteries at high voltages and analyzed the resulting deposits and chemical changes.

Result: The study reveals that cycling between 4-6 V vs Li leads to dispersed particles and LiF amorphous phases that inhibit dissolution, while cycling between 2.5-5.5 V results in an anodic current peak due to the formation of a 36 nm amorphous thin film. LiF dissolution involves a two-step process: oxidative intermediates formation followed by reduction.

Conclusion: These findings deepen our understanding of CEI formation and dissolution mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of further studies across different potential ranges and electrolyte types.

Abstract: A deeper understanding of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation
mechanism is essential to elucidate battery degradation. Here, we combine
Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy (ec-TEM) with Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to monitor CEI evolution in a
realistic electrochemical environment, focusing on electrolyte behavior under
high voltages. The correlation between the electrochemical response, gas and
liquid analysis after cycling, and the observation of deposited species on the
working electrode (WE) reveals the processes governing CEI formation,
stability, and composition. Cycling between 4 and 6 V vs Li leads to dispersed
particles instead of a continuous film. These are partly composed of LiF and an
amorphous phase that prevents dissolution at high potential. When cycled
between 2.5 and 5.5 V, an anodic current peak indicates the formation of a 36
nm amorphous thin film without crystalline LiF, attributed to EC oxidation
producing HF and subsequent LiF at a higher potential. LiF dissolution appears
to follow a two-step pathway: electrolyte oxidation forms soluble
intermediates, which are later reduced at lower potential to yield species
capable of dissolving LiF. These results provide new insights into CEI
formation and dissolution mechanisms, underscoring the need for further studies
across different potential windows and with non carbonate electrolytes to
validate these findings.

Motivation: 探索量子临界铁磁材料的微观磁性机制，深入了解CeRh6Ge4中4f轨道磁矩的行为

Method: 通过NQR和NMR测量不同Ge原子位置的电场梯度张量，并通过1/T1实验研究磁弛豫行为，利用超fine场分析方法和Zeeman扰动分析来模拟不同物理量的空间变化

Result: 研究发现CeRh6Ge4在0 K时表现出完整的铁磁有序，有序磁矩沿ab平面，约0.26 μ_B/Praseodymium。磁性强度在ab平面内表现出较大的磁性刚性，尤其是在平面外的磁扰动下。核磁矩在量子临界点附近表现出明显的超前行为和抗磁性，暗示铁磁状态与少数磁性原子的有序状态共同存在，并且局部磁矩与普适普特点!

Abstract: We report $^{73}$Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy in the heavy-fermion quantum-critical ferromagnet
CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$. NQR and NMR spectral measurements at the two non-equivalent Ge
sites reveal electric field gradient tensors and the directions of their
principal axes relative to the hexagonal basal plane. The spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ experiments reveal a clear critical slowing down
approaching the ferromagnetic transition. $1/T_1$ in the paramagnetic state is
found to be predominantly caused by fluctuating 4$f$-local moments. The Knight
shift shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperature and a deviation from this
below $T^\ast$ $\approx$ 25 K possibly due to a mixture of crystalline electric
field effects and Kondo screening. Order-parameter-like behavior of hyperfine
fields at the Ge sites and ferromagnetic signal enhancement are observed in
Zeeman-perturbed NQR, with uniform ferromagnetic order and a small ordered
moment of $\approx$ 0.26 $\mu_B$/Ce confined within the $ab$-plane. The ordered
moment shows a notable in-plane magnetic stiffness against out-of-plane
radiofrequency fields and has an (XY-type) in-plane isotropic nature. Our
results reveal a strong easy-plane anisotropy of 4$f$-electron moment and
suggest an involved interplay of hybridization and local moment physics in this
quantum critical heavy-fermion ferromagnet.

Abstract: Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding
the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions,
a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic
has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements
as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory
comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation
of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density
($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$
devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range
($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC
simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus
allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify
two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the
magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior
is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid
phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel
oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are
suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher
$n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our
work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a
combined experimental-theoretical approach.

Abstract: Within the framework of a model, that takes into account two-particle
hybridization of conduction and localized electrons, the effective interaction
between conduction electrons is calculated. It is shown that this interaction
is attractive when the energy of the localized electron corresponding to the
two-particle state lies in the conduction band above the Fermi energy. The
magnitude of the attractive interaction is minimal for $\eta$-paired states of
conduction electrons. We generalize the original $\eta$-pairing construction
for the proposed model and show that the superconducting state can indeed be
realized.

Abstract: Spin current generated electrically is among the core phenomena of
spintronics for driving high-performance spin device applications. Here, on the
basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer
Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the
compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity
where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our
results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$
gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with
$T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to
$z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition,
though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted
by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring
negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity,
indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin
Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our
work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the
compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall
conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems.

Motivation: Understanding van der Waals materials that exhibit both quantum spin chains and classical Neel order is important for exploring novel magnetic properties and potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

Method: Monte Carlo simulations, DMRG, and DFT calculations were used to model and understand the experimental observations in MoX3 crystal growth and magnetic behavior.

Result: Single crystals of MoX3 have classical antiferromagnetic ground states with Tc~40 K, and exhibit quantum spin-singlet gap of 21-25 meV above this temperature, consistent with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: MoX3 offers a rare platform for studying the interplay between quantum and classical magnetic orders in a van der Waals material, providing insights into low-dimensional magnetic systems and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We report that MoX3 (X = I, Br) are rare van der Waals materials that exhibit
signatures of both quantum spin chains with a spin singlet ground state and
classical Neel order. Bulk single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport
exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ground states with a transition temperature
of ~40 K as revealed by susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Above 40
K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum
spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV.
Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for
finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the
experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional
intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a
unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Stimulated by recent experiments on materials representing the realization of
the anisotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ model on the triangular lattice, we
explore further properties of such a model in the easy-axis regime $\alpha =
J_\perp/J_z < 1$, as well as effective models that also capture such physics.
We show that anisotropic Heisenberg models on the honeycomb lattice and even on
the square lattice reveal similarities to the full triangular lattice in the
magnetization curve as well as in the transverse magnetization (superfluid)
order parameter $m_\perp$ at finite fields. Still, at $\alpha \ll 1$, results
reveal gapless excitations and small but finite $m_\perp >0 $ at effective
fields corresponding to the triangular case without the field. In contrast,
several additional numerical studies of the full model on the triangular
lattice confirm the existence of the gap at $\alpha \ll 1$. In particular, the
magnetization curve $m(h)$ as well as the spin stiffness $\rho_s$ indicate (at
zero field) a transition/crossover from gapped to gapless regime at $\alpha
\sim \alpha^*$ with $\alpha^* \lesssim 0.5$. We also show that deviations from
the linear spin-wave theory and the emergence of the gap can be traced back to
the strong effective repulsion between magnon excitations, having similarity to
strongly correlated systems.

Conclusion: Expands the applicability of BEC-driven quantum criticality to high-spin, low-dimensional antiferromagnets with negligible anisotropy, providing new insights into Quantum phase transitions and high-spin magnon physics.

Abstract: Quantum magnets offer a unique platform for exploring exotic quantum phases
and quantum phase transitions through external magnetic fields. A prominent
example is the field-induced Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons near
the saturation field. While this behavior has been observed in low-spin
systems, its realization in high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional magnets -- where
multiple on-site excitations are possible -- remains exceptionally rare. Here,
we report thermodynamic and density functional theory results on single
crystals of the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet K$_{4}$MnMo$_{4}$O$_{15}$
with $S = 5/2$. The system undergoes a field-induced transition to a fully
polarized state at the critical field $\mu_{0}H_{\rm s} = 6.4$~T. Our results
reveal possible thermodynamic signatures of magnon BEC, $T_{\mathrm{N}} \sim

Abstract: In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought
to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by
the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a
new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding
calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for
entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic
signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity
($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \propto \log T$.
Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the
high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass
renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we
analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature
evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a
strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian
$T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains
Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a
collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes
across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the
cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum
critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer
nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that
strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop practical, room-temperature magnetic field sensors for applications like medical devices and environmental monitoring.

Method: Microwave-based probing of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond is used to simultaneously measure DC magnetic fields with sensitivities below 1 nT/$	ext{Hz}^{1/2}$.

Result: The method achieves sensitivities of 1-4 nT/$	ext{Hz}^{1/2}$ by comparing maximum likelihood estimation and neural network models.

Conclusion: This technology enables real-time, low-power, high-sensitivity magnetic sensing without bias fields, opening new possibilities for future improvements.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable and
versatile light-matter interfaces with practical application in magnetic field
sensing, offering the ability to operate at room temperature and reach
sensitivities below pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We propose an approach to
simultaneously probe all of the magnetically sensitive states using a broadband
microwave field and demonstrate that it can be used to measure the external DC
magnetic field strength with sensitivities below 1~nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We
develop tools for analyzing the temporal signatures in the transmitted
broadband microwaves to estimate the magnetic field, comparing maximum
likelihood estimation based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to
various neural network models, and both methods independently reach practical
sensitivities. These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as
the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with
further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be
envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic
sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz
update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic
field.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin
defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application
of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among
metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and
electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies.
However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their
quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered
diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with
different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum
properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial
reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the
NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a
result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be
efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we
observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum
thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near
platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films
with near-surface NV centers.

TL;DR: The study examines the topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid describing edge states in the ν=1/3 quantum Hall state by measuring the tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes using a quantum point contact. The results show that the scaling exponent g is pinned to 1/3 robustly, even in the presence of weak disorder, supporting the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge states and the topological nature of the ν=1/3 state.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the robustness of topological states in quantum Hall systems is key to their potential use in quantum computing and fundamental physics.

Method: The researchers measure the tunneling conductance as a function of transmission for a quantum point contact, fitting the data to the first two terms of a perturbative expansion to extract the scaling exponent g.

Result: The scaling exponent g is found to be robustly pinned to 1/3 across a plateau in the ν=1/3 state, even when the bulk becomes compressible. The conductance is well described by the first two terms of the expansion, indicating agreement with the chiral Luttinger liquid theory.

Conclusion: This work provides strong evidence for the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at ν=1/3 and validates the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge state.

Abstract: The scaling exponent $g$ of the quasiparticle propagator for incompressible
fractional quantum Hall states in the Laughlin sequence is expected to be
robust against perturbations that do not close the gap. Here we probe the
topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the
$\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between
counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact
transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\geq 0.7$ the tunneling
conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series
expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured
scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only
deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact
of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These
measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at
$\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge
mode.

Abstract: Understanding energy transport at the nanoscale is an open and fundamental
challenge in the molecular sciences with direct implications for the design of
new electronics, computing devices, and materials. While nanoscale energy
transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is
much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces,
particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to
investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular
junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary
observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis,
a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the
instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the
temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular
junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis,
that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work

Abstract: We show that the initialization of an ensemble of electrons in the same spin
state in strained n-InGaAs subject to a perpendicular magnetic field triggers
an AC electric current at GHz frequencies. The AC current emerges in the
absence of any driving force and survives until the coherent precession of the
electron spins is lost. The current amplitude increases linearly with both the
spin-orbit coupling strength and the external magnetic field. The generation
mechanism of the observed oscillatory charge motion can be fruitfully described
in terms of the periodic trembling motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is
a solid-state analog to the Zitterbewegung of free Dirac electrons. Our results
demonstrate that the hidden consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics is
realized and can be studied in a rather simple solid-state system at moderate
temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high
magnetic fields enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids.

Abstract: Weyl semimetals, with their unique electronic band structure, have drawn
significant interest for their potential to explore quantum anomalies in
condensed matter systems. In this study, we investigate the large positive
magneto-thermal conductance associated with the gravitational anomaly -- one of
the predicted anomalies -- for a Weyl semimetal based on a compressively
strained HgTe layer. We clearly identify the Weyl regime in our device and
accurately extract the thermal conductance by performing thermometry
measurements at liquid helium temperatures using fully electronic methods. We
observe the anticipated increase in thermal conductance, and it perfectly
matches the electrical conductance according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. This
finding indicates that, despite the unique electronic spectrum of Weyl
semimetals, the mechanism governing heat transport in this system is the same
as that for electrical transport, with no additional violations of conservation
laws.

Abstract: The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the
theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or
even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient
framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a
multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary
shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is
based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the
Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within
a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without
requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the
full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located
in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is
easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.

Abstract: Phonon transport near nanoscale hotspots (NHs) critically determines heat
dissipation in advanced electronic devices. The prevailing understanding is
that the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long
mean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,
thereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat
effectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann
transport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture
mode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon
populations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near
NHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of
long-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons
heat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient
near the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions
to the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the
critical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport. These
results provide new physical insights into nanoscale thermal management and
highlight the importance of spectral mode resolution in modeling heat
dissipation in electronic devices.

Motivation: It is recognized that magnetic impurities in MTIs cause dissipation, hindering their use as high-speed, low-power spintronic devices. The motivation is to find a way to reduce this dissipation.

Method: The study focuses on electronic backscattering in MTI thin films. It explores how external magnetic fields and electronic stimuli can suppress this backscattering, aiming to achieve dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport.

Result: The researchers successfully demonstrate that applying external magnetic or electronic stimuli can suppress electronic backscattering in MTI thin films, leading to an entirely dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport.

Conclusion: This work provides a pathway to enhance the functionality and efficiency of MTIs in spintronic applications by reducing energy dissipation through control of electronic backscattering mechanisms.

Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are among the prominent platforms for
the next generation of high-speed and low-power spintronic devices. However,
unlike their non-magnetic counterparts, where the surface spin-momentum locking
prevents electrons from being scattered by non-magnetic impurities and results
in a dissipationless electronic flow, magnetic impurities in MTIs cause
dissipation by exerting magnetic torque on the electron spin. Decreasing this
resistance is desired to reduce energy consumption and optimize performance of
MTIs in envisaged applications. Here we reveal how electronic backscattering
can be suppressed in a MTI thin film by external magnetic and/or electronic
stimuli, to yield an entirely dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport.
Our findings thus present an effective route to preserve spin coherence and
enhance spin-current functionality in magnetic topological materials,
suggesting design strategies for magneto-electronic and spintronic devices with
strongly reduced energy consumption.

$N$-solitons of the CNLS equations, and $N_{1}+\lfloor (N_{2}+1)/2 \rfloor$ for
$(N_{1},N_{2})$-solitons of the CmKdV equations, which is obtained by
exploiting integrable properties. The stability of solitons for the classical

*Louis González,Andrew Mugler*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: Exosomes help cells communicate, but their effectiveness depends on size and how far they travel. Smaller exosomes are common but weak, while larger ones are stronger but less frequent. The best size balances these factors for efficient signaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research addresses a fascinating question about how cells use exosomes for communication over long distances. It's critical for understanding cell signaling in development, disease, and other cellular processes.

Method: The study combines theoretical models and computational simulations to explore how exosome size affects chemotaxis. They model exosome release and cell migration, analyzing different cargo sizes and their impact on movement speed.

Result: The findings reveal that exosome size significantly influences signaling effectiveness. Smaller exosomes, though common, result in more frequent but weaker signals, while larger ones, less common, produce stronger but less frequent signals. This trade-off determines the optimal exosome size for efficient signaling.

Conclusion: This work uncovers the optimal conditions for exosome-mediated chemotaxis, highlighting the importance of cargo size and memory integration. The results provide valuable insights for optimizing communication strategies among migrating cells.

Abstract: Cells frequently employ extracellular vesicles, or exosomes, to signal across
long distances and coordinate collective actions. Exosomes diffuse slowly, can
be actively degraded, and contain stochastic amounts of molecular cargo. These
features raise the question of the efficacy of exosomes as a directional
signal, but this question has not be systematically investigated. We develop a
theoretical and computational approach to quantify the limits of
exosome-mediated chemotaxis at the individual cell level. In our model, a
leader cell secretes exosomes, which diffuse in the extracellular space, and a
follower cell guides its migration by integrating discrete exosome detections
over a finite memory window. We combine analytical calculations and stochastic
simulations and show that the chemotactic velocity exhibits a non-monotonic
dependence on the exosome cargo size. Small exosomes produce frequent but weak
signals, whereas large exosomes produce strong but infrequent encounters. In
the presence of nonlinear signal transduction, this tradeoff leads to an
optimal cargo size that maximizes information throughput, as quantified by the
average speed of the follower cell. Using a reduced one-dimensional model, we
derive closed-form expressions coupling the optimal cargo size to follower
speed as a function of secretion rate, memory time, and detection sensitivity.
These results identify molecular packaging and memory integration as key
determinants of exosome-mediated information transmission and highlight general
design principles for optimization of migration under guidance by discrete and
diffusible signaling particles.

Abstract: Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is a significant
public health concern in North America, with approximately 500,000 cases
reported annually in the United States. The dissemination of B. burgdorferi
from the initial tick bite site to various tissues is facilitated by surface
adhesins that bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin
(Fn). This study investigates the binding dynamics of B. burgdorferi surface
proteins RevA, BBK32, BmpA, OspA, and OspC to Fn using atomic force
microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS). Our results
demonstrate that RevA and BBK32 form strong, stable bonds with Fn, highlighting

TL;DR: 该研究建立了一个简化的解析模型以研究大单层乳胶泡（GUVs）同时受电场变形和电孔化的影响机制。在小形变极限下，通过求解电穿孔、电流体动力学和膜力学，发现电孔化产生的额外膜面积表现为P2(cos{θ})、P4(cos{θ})和P6(cos{θ}) Legendre模式的振幅，分别作为形状函数。该模型表明，在强脉冲DC场下，GUVs的显著变形主要由于电孔化引入的膜面积增加。因此，GUVs的变形结果平衡了电应力和膜、流体动力学的应力后，呈现出圆柱形或方形的形变，而弱电场下的圆椭球形形变。较高阶模式的起源主要是由于电孔引起的膜导体电导随角度近似于2/3(1/2+P2(cos{θ}))，从而使得电势除了P1(cos{θ})外还存在P3(cos{θ})。膜泡相应地出现了P4(cos{θ})和P6(cos{θ})形状的变形模式，除了P2(cos{θ})模式被视为未电孔的泡膜的变形。此外，Maxwell应力对电场的二次依赖关系是导致这一现象的原因。该模型在较大程度上正确地捕捉到了方块形模式、椭圆柱形（当η>1时）和扁平圆柱形（当η<1时）的形状特征，其中η=σi/σe是内液与外液的电导率之比。

Result: 模型揭示了在强DC场下，GUVs的显着变形主要由于电孔化导致的膜面积增加，呈现圆柱形或方形形变，而非弱电场下的圆椭球形变。通过二次依赖关系的Maxwell应力动力学，模型被解析化简，成功地捕捉了不同η值下的不同形变特征。

Conclusion: 电孔化是GUVs在强脉冲DC场强形变的主要因素，电孔导致的额外膜面积和Maxwell应力二次依赖关系使得GUVs呈现出不同的形变模式。该研究为理解电场作用下生物膜的形变机制提供了理论模型和解析框架。

Abstract: This work attempts to understand the mechanism of simultaneous
electrodeformation and electroporation in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs)
using a minimal analytical model. In the small deformation limit, the coupled
electroporation, electrohydrodynamics and membrane mechanics are solved. The
excess membrane area generated by electroporation manifests as amplitudes of
the second, fourth, and sixth Legendre modes, P2(cos{\theta}), P4(cos{\theta}),
and P6(cos{\theta}), respectively, which serves as the shape function. The
proposed model reveals that accentuated deformation in GUVs under strong pulsed
DC fields arises from the additional surface area introduced by membrane
poration. Thus, the resulting GUV deformation, obtained as a result of a
balance of electric stresses and the membrane and hydrodynamic stresses, is
prolate or oblate cylindrical or square shaped instead of prolate or oblate
ellipsoids, as otherwise seen under weak AC/DC fields. The origin of higher
modes is essentially due to electropore-generated membrane conductance, which
is approximated to angularly vary as 2/3(1/2+P2(cos{\theta})), to keep the
calculations analytically tractable, whereby the electric potential varies as
P3(cos{\theta}) in addition to P1(cos{\theta}) seen for unporated vesicles. The
vesicle correspondingly admits P4(cos{\theta}) and P6(cos{\theta}) shape
deformation modes, besides P2(cos{\theta}) observed for unporated vesicles, on
account of the quadratic dependence of Maxwell stresses on the electric field.
The model qualitatively and semiquantitatively, with a correction factor
(fitting parameter), captures the square shape modes for \b{eta} = 1, prolate
ellipsoids (cylinders) for \b{eta} >1, and oblate cylinders for \b{eta} < 1,
where \b{eta} ={\sigma}i/{\sigma}e is the ratio of the electrical conductivity
of the inner fluid ({\sigma}i) to the outer fluid ({\sigma}e).

Abstract: A shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate released from its confinement expands
radially both outwards and inwards, displaying a self-interference pattern
characterized by a density peak surrounded by a halo. Here we analyze how an
external imprinting or the thermal fluctuations of the condensate phase
influence this expansion. In both cases, we find that the curved geometry
filters the imploding finite angular-momentum modes via a radial centrifugal
potential, so that only the condensate state can reach the origin and form the
central peak. As a consequence, we observe a pronounced dependence of the
central density on the imprinting strength and on temperature. This geometric
filtering effect characterizes the free expansion of curved atomic gases in
contrast with flat counterparts, it is easily observable in the available
experimental platforms, and enables two-dimensional shells thermometry via
simple absorption-imaging techniques.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The research uses density functional theory to examine the formation and stability of vortices in quantum liquid droplets made of potassium hyperfine states. By compressing the droplets towards a quasi-two-dimensional shape, they found that the minimum number of atoms needed for stable vortices is significantly lower than previous predictions for spherical droplets. Additionally, their results suggest that fully empty vortices are more stable in homogeneous mixtures compared to partially filled vortices in heteronuclear mixtures. The transition between empty and partially filled vortices depends on the number of particles and rotation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This study is motivated by the experimental successes in creating quantum droplets and the desire to understand the conditions under which vortices form and remain stable. It also aims to provide insights for future experimental observations of vortices in such droplets, which are currently underexplored.

Method: They employed density functional theory to model and simulate the behavior of quantum droplets under different conditions, such as varying the degree of compression and the speed of rotation.

Result: The key findings are: (1) the critical atom number for stable vortices in quasi-two-dimensional droplets is much lower than previously predicted for spherical droplets; (2) in homogeneous potassium mixtures, fully empty vortices are more stable than partially filled ones; and (3) the transition from empty to partially filled vortices occurs when the number of particles and rotation speed reach certain thresholds.

Conclusion: These results contribute to the theoretical understanding of vortex formation in quantum droplets and pave the way for experimental verification, particularly in quasi-two-dimensional systems. The findings also highlight potential differences in vortex behavior between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures.

Abstract: Using density functional theory, we have theoretically studied the formation
and the stability of vortices in quantum liquid droplets composed of a mixture
of hyperfine states of potassium. Following the experimental setup that
produced quantum droplets for the first time, we work with squeezed drops that
are compressed in one direction. By squeezing the drops even more, towards a
quasi-two dimensional geometry, we study the minimum atom number able to show a
stable vortex and obtain that this number is significantly smaller than
previous predictions for spherical droplets. The reduction of the critical atom
number for forming a stable vortex could make their experimental observation in
these droplets, which is still lacking, more feasible. Contrary to results
obtained in heteronuclear mixtures, where the energetically preferred vortices
are partially filled with the species not participating in the rotation, our
results show a relevant stability island of fully empty vortices. Increasing
the number of particles in the drop and the speed of rotation, we estimate the
transition line between empty and filled vortices.

Abstract: We study how gradually changing the chemical potential causes a
two-dimensional binary Bose gas to condense from vacuum to finite density,
resulting in either a mixed (miscible) or separated (immiscible) state
depending on interaction strengths. In the immiscible case, random domains
form, and their number, boundary length, and average size at the point of
equilibration follow universal Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling with the cooling rate.
These patterns continue to evolve in a self-similar way while maintaining KZ
scaling. In the miscible regime, instead of domains, vortices appear, following
the KZ scaling. The spatial distribution of domains and vortices is described
by a Poisson point process with the KZ density. These findings highlight
robust, universal features of how binary superfluids behave far from
equilibrium, extending beyond the KZ theory.

Abstract: Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical
insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural
integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires
consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial
distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing
non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution,
and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise
observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ
neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of
view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and
distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature
accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission
attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the
two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating
non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss
and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying.
Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron
transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of
hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying
does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively
decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal
that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while
low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study
unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs,
offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and

Abstract: Low temperature water electrolyzers (LTWEs) and low temperature hydrogen fuel
cells (LTFCs) present a promising technological strategy for the productions
and usages of green hydrogen energy towards a net-zero world. However, the
interactions of gas/liquid (fluid) transport and the intrinsic reaction
kinetics in LTWEs/LTFCs present one of the key hurdles hindering high
production rate and high energy conversion efficiency. Addressing these
limitations requires analytical tools that are capable of resolving fluid
transport across the heterogeneous, multiscale structures of operating LTWE and
LTFC systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent
advancements in measurement technologies for investigating fluid transport. We
first outline the technical requirements of such analytical systems, and assess
the capabilities and limitations of established optical, X-rays and neutrons
based imaging systems. We emphasis on emerging strategies that utilize
integrated miniaturized sensors, ultrasound, and other alternative physical
principles to achieve operando, high-resolution, and scalable measurements
towards applications at device and system levels. Finally, we outline future
directions in this highly interdisciplinary field, emphasizing the importance
of next-generation sensing concepts to overcome the fluid transport hurdle,
towards accelerating the deployment of green hydrogen technologies.

Abstract: The LCLS began operations in 2009, utilizing SLAC's normal-conducting (NC)
LINAC, which features control equipment dating back to the 1960s and 1980s. The
Linac Electronics Modernization Plan (LEMP) aims to replace the legacy control

Adaptation of the LLRF system developed for the continuous-wave (CW)
superconducting RF (SRF) LCLS-II to the short-RF pulse NC LCLS includes
leveraging the knowledge and experience gained from recent LLRF projects at
SLAC and efficiently reusing the core functionality of the hardware and code

Abstract: High-power multi-color terahertz (THz) radiation exhibits extraordinary
scientific application prospects at various scientific frontiers, for its
capacity to deliver THz excitation at multiple frequencies simultaneously.
However, the generation of high-power multi-color THz radiation with tunable
frequencies remains a challenge for existing techniques. Here, a technique by
combining the multi-laser pulses frequency beating and coherent undulator
amplification is proposed for generating high-power multi-color THz radiation
with tunable frequency. Numerical simulations indicate that the proposed
technique can produce multi-color THz radiation with three to six distinguished
colors and a peak power up to hundreds of MW, and the temporally separated
two-color pulses can also be produced by employing undulators with different
resonance. Due to the intrinsic properties of the proposed technique, the THz
frequencies, the color number and the frequency interval can be effectively
controlled by simply adjusting the beating laser. This method paves the way for
advanced application of THz pump-THz probe experiments for selective excitation
of atomic multi-level systems and molecular fingerprint recognition.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study acceleration radiation from a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector that
undergoes small-amplitude radial oscillations at fixed mean radius $R_0$
outside a Schwarzschild black hole. The massless scalar field is quantized in
the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without
a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using
first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged
transition rate (or the "Floquet" transition rate). The resulting particle
emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic
trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\Omega > \omega_0$ and a
closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\overline{P}_n$ which
reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\to\infty$. Near the
horizon, $f(R_0)<1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by
$1/\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of
curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the
spectrum weighted by Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole
horizon as $R_{0}\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known
pathological behavior of Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of
validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the
extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody
factors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically
tractable link between flat-space "vibrating atom" proposals and black-hole
spacetimes.

*J. K. Singh,Sonal Aggarwal,Shaily,Hamid Shabani*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines late-time cosmic acceleration in Quintessence models within the Hoyle Narlikar Gravity framework, incorporating a creation field. Using Hubble tension and density parameters, they derive gravitational field equations in spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime, exploring the dynamical mechanism behind cosmic acceleration. Observational constraints from datasets like H0ST, Pantheon+, and joint compilation suggest consistency with recent data. Compared to other modified gravity theories, Hoyle Narlikar Gravity with non-minimal matter interaction yields more stringent constraints on the Hubble tension and density parameters, aligning well with accelerating expansion. Phase analysis (w–dot) reveals alternating thawing and freezing behavior, with all trajectories converging towards the ΛCDM point, enhancing confidence in the model's stability and observational consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding late-time cosmic acceleration is crucial for reconciling general relativity with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Exploring alternative gravity models offers a way to explain dark energy effects without introducing a cosmological constant.

Method: Mathematical analysis and observational data fitting: Used Hubble tension data, Pantheon+ SN Ia data, and joint compilation datasets to constrain model parameters. Derived gravitational field equations under the Hoyle Narlikar Gravity framework with a creation field.

Result: Late-time cosmic acceleration is consistent with observations in Hoyle Narlikar Gravity with non-minimal matter interaction. The creation field contributes to enhanced constraints on the Hubble tension and density parameters compared to other modified gravity theories, supporting the model's viability.

Conclusion: Hoyle Narlikar Gravity with non-minimal matter interaction provides a viable alternative to ΛCDM for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration. The model's alternating thawing and freezing behavior, along with convergence to ΛCDM-like behavior, further supports its consistency and plausibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the late time cosmic acceleration of the Quintessence
model within the framework of Hoyle Narlikar Gravity, consisting of a creation
field. Using the Hubble tension as a function of the density parameter for
matter, the density parameter for radiation, and the density parameter for dark
energy in the covariant formulation, we find the gravitational field equations
in the spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime to examine the
dynamical mechanism that leads to cosmic acceleration in the late-time
universe. We analyze the observational constraints on the late-time density
parameters using various recent observational datasets, including the Hubble
datasets, Pantheon+, and joint compilation, Pantheon++BAO. Consequently, it is
explicitly demonstrated that late-time cosmic acceleration can be consistent
with recent observational data in Hoyle Narlikar Gravity with non-minimal
matter interaction. In contrast with other modified theories of gravity, it is
observed that the creation field theory with non-minimal matter interaction
renders more compact constraints on the Hubble tension together with density
parameters, and extensively explains the accelerating expansion of the
universe, which makes it a more plausible option compared to the {\Lambda}CDM
model. Furthermore, the w dw phase analysis confirms alternating thawing and
freezing behaviour of the model, with all trajectories ultimately converging
toward the {\Lambda}CDM point, thereby confirming the model stability and the
observational consistency.

Abstract: Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically
exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard
black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra
fundamental fields --such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom--
that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued,
in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling
them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work,
we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often
neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of
gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on
dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories,
well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and
a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature
invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the
bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for
equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts.
Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced
modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or
enhance constraints on GR deviations.

Abstract: Numerical relativity (NR) enables the study of physics in strong and
dynamical gravitational fields and provides predictions for the
gravitational-wave signals produced by merging black holes. Despite the
impressive accuracy of modern codes, the resulting waveforms inevitably contain
numerical uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties is important,
especially for studies probing subdominant or nonlinear effects around the
merger and ringdown. This paper describes a flexible Gaussian-process model for
the numerical uncertainties in all the spherical-harmonic waveform modes across
a state-of-the-art catalog of NR waveforms and a highly efficient procedure for
sampling the posteriors of quasinormal mode models without the need for
expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo. The Gaussian-process model is used to
define a likelihood function which allows many Bayesian data analysis
techniques - already widely used in the analysis of experimental gravitational
wave data - to be applied to NR waveforms as well. The efficacy of this
approach is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of quasinormal modes in
Cauchy-characteristic evolved waveforms.

Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive
astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable
consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW
events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection
of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources
of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties.
Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise
contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the
astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of
unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR)
depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed
astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have
performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated
population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of
the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold
signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs
of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter
space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over
which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW
pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique
will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW
detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers provide a glimpse of
gravitational dynamics in its most extreme observable regime, potentially
enabling precision tests of general relativity (GR) and of the Kerr description
of black holes. However, until recently, numerical simulations of black hole
mergers have not been possible in theories beyond GR. While recent
breakthroughs have overcome that obstacle, simulations covering the full,
interesting range of binary parameters remain unfeasible. Here we present a new
first-principles approach to this problem. We show how self-force theory can be
used to model the merger and ringdown of black holes in a broad class of
gravitational theories, assuming one object is much smaller than the other. We
calculate self-force effects on the merger waveform for the first time, and we
demonstrate how our formulation allows us to modularly compute beyond-GR
effects and readily incorporate them into a fast merger-ringdown waveform
model.

Abstract: In this article, we study the complexity growth rate for Banados Teitlboim
Zanelli, Schwarzschild, Reissner Nordstrom, and Kerr black holes using
complexity-volume (CV) and complexity-action (CA) dualities and verify that it
is proportional to the product of the horizon temperature and entropy of the
black holes as conjectured by Susskind. Furthermore, we explore the variation
in the complexity growth rate $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ under various physical
processes, including the Penrose process, superradiance, particle accretion,
and Hawking radiation, and demonstrate that $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ exhibits
non-trivial behavior. Under the Penrose process and superradiance, $\delta
\dot{\mathcal{C}}$ always increases, and under particle accretion, $\delta
\dot{\mathcal{C}}$ can increase, remain zero, or decrease depending upon the
direction of angular momentum of an infalling particle. For the cases of
particle accretion, where we find $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ to be negative, we
argue that for a reliable estimate, one has to take into account the
contribution of the horizon dynamics of the perturbed black hole to the growth
of its complexity.

Abstract: While the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer proposals for
next-generation, ground-based detectors promise vastly improved sensitivities
to gravitational-wave signals, only joint observations are expected to enable
the full scientific potential of these facilities, making timing and
coordination between the efforts crucial to avoid missed opportunities. This
study investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific
capabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher
information formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks
for large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars,
and primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we
map the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations
fulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics
across various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to
stochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as
the signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between
facilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very
sensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to
delayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one
detector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics
for networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the
impact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India
operating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an
addition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization
metrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic
searches.

physically consistent description of viscosity-driven accelerated expansion. We
adopt the standard parametrization for the bulk viscosity, $\xi = \xi_{0}
\rho_{m}^{s}$, treating $s$ as a free parameter, and study the model in a
spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. By reformulating the
cosmological equations as an autonomous dynamical system, we obtain both
asymptotic analytical solutions and a numerical characterization of the phase
space. At early times, the viscous component can mimic a stiff fluid, while at
intermediate epochs it behaves like dark matter. With a suitable choice of
dynamical variables, the system admits three distinct classes of late-time
attractors. Two of them are separated by a basin-boundary saddle point: (i) a
generic quintessence solution for $s = 1/2$, which encompasses a de Sitter-like
behavior when $\xi_{0}$ satisfies a specific relation involving the nonlinear
parameters; (ii) a global exact de Sitter attractor for $s < 1/2$; and (iii) a
phantom-like solution that emerges for $s \ge 1/2$. In contrast to the generic
$s \ne 1/2$ case, the $s = 1/2$ scenario exhibits a qualitatively different
stability structure, allowing de Sitter and phantom attractors to coexist. All
solutions respect entropy production, and cosmic acceleration emerges
independently of $\xi_{0}$, relaxing the strong bounds $\xi_{0} \sim
\mathcal{O}(1)$ required in Eckart-based viscous models.

Abstract: We study information paradox of four dimensional covariant black holes
inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG) with two well motivated solutions. We
first prepare the spacetime in the Hartle-Hawking state, compute the radiation
entropy and recover a linear growth at late time. When considering the mass
loss and incorporating greybody factors, we show that for Solution~1 the LQG
parameter $\zeta$ leaves temperature and Planckian factor of the spectrum
unchanged but enhances the near-horizon barrier, leading to a faster
evaporation rate as $M$ decreases. This behavior contrasts sharply with
Solution~2, which has slow evaporation rate at small $M$ and admits a
non-singular continuation suggestive of a remnant or a black-to-white-hole
transition. We then apply the island prescription on the eternal background and
find that quantum extremal surfaces exist in solution 1 geometries; $\zeta$
primarily shifts the island boundary and suppresses the late time entropy
growth, preserving unitarity. Our results highlight that covariance-respecting
LQG black hole do not exhibit a universal late time behavior.

Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model,
within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by
B\"ohmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified
Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system.
Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in
transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points.
We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of
the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark
energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with
their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs
in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter
attractor.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a secondary potential barrier, forming a
potential well outside the event horizon, can destabilize the Quasinormal Mode
(QNM) spectrum of black holes. We find that spectral instability may persist
even after the potential well vanishes, giving rise to a distinct family of
spectrally unstable QNMs that differ from the spectrally stable modes localized
near the potential peak and associated with the photon sphere. Nevertheless,
time-domain simulations reveal that early-time ringdown waveforms remain
dominated by stable modes, while unstable modes have only a subdominant
contribution. These results highlight the robustness of black hole
spectroscopy, as the observable ringdown signal is primarily governed by the
most stable QNMs.

Conclusion: 非极小耦合作用对正则黑洞 Hawking 辐射具有不可忽视的影响，需要在未来的研究中进一步考虑其影响。

Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple
to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of
Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often
introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is
generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We
revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four
representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and
D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case
$\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation.
We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter
can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A
crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in
Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal
coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the
D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission
spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR<0$
throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the
transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the
case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the
non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.

*Nakul Aggarwal,Ali Pourmand,Fatimah Shojai,Harish Parthasarathy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the cosmological implications of $f(Q)$ gravity with non-minimal coupling to matter by utilizing a background fluid consisting of baryonic matter, radiation, and various Chaplygin gas variants. They employ four different Chaplygin gas models: Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG), alongside the standard $	extit{Λ}$CDM model. The analysis incorporates three observational datasets: OHD, BAO, and QSO, with OHD errors analytically modeled to streamline the process. The study assesses the models' transitions from decelerated to accelerated expansion through kinematic parameters and the Om diagnostic, concluding that each model has a distinct transition redshift compared to $	extit{Λ}$CDM and exhibits varying levels of departure from it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cosmological studies aim to understand the expansion dynamics of the universe. The application of non-minimally coupled $f(Q)$ gravity models with diverse background fluids offers a novel approach to explore deviations from the standard $	extit{Λ}$CDM model. This research enhances our capability to analyze alternative gravitational theories and their alignment with observational data.

Method: The methodologies employed include the use of four distinct Chaplygin gas models and three observational datasets: OHD, BAO, and QSO. The research incorporates both theoretical framework construction and statistical analysis. A distinctive method is the analytical modeling of OHD errors to substitute for computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The joint analysis reveals that the transition redshift for acceleration in the GCG, MCG, and VCG models are 0.620±0.018, 0.537±0.017, and 0.470±0.012, respectively, compared to ΛCDM. Each variant shows a unique departure from the standard model, indicating their potential for explaining the universe's expansion history with varying degrees of deviation.

Conclusion: The research concludes that $f(Q)$ gravity coupled with non-minimal matter interactions, when combined with Chaplygin gas variants, provides a viable alternative to ΛCDM. The distinct transition redshifts for each model suggest that they could serve as competitive models in cosmological studies, depending on observational constraints and future data refinement.

Abstract: In the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where gravity emerges from non-metricity
$Q$, we explore the cosmological implications of its non-minimal coupling to
matter. Inspired by the recent success of Chaplygin gas models in explaining
dark energy, we consider a background fluid composed of baryonic matter,
radiation, and a family of Chaplygin gas variants namely Generalized Chaplygin
Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG). We
constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational
Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and
Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical
expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte
Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and
jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models
from $\Lambda$CDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the
transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the
universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$,
$0.537^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ and $0.470^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ respectively,
indicating a departure from $\Lambda$CDM.

Abstract: This paper presents OCTOPUS, a relativistic ray-tracing algorithm developed
within a Fortran-based, OpenMP-accelerated framework, designed for
asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric curved spacetimes. The code
efficiently and accurately computes key relativistic features -- including the
black hole event horizon, photon rings, critical curves, and innermost stable
circular orbits -- and simulates black hole shadows, redshift factor
distributions, accretion disk images, toroidal images, as well as gravitational
lensing, light curves, and gravitational radiation from hot-spots. OCTOPUS
provides an automated, modular solution for qualitative studies of black hole
observables and multi-messenger correlations between electromagnetic and
gravitational signals in curved spacetime. Its implementation requires only the
metric potential and its first-, second-, and third-order radial derivatives as
input, ensuring low user barriers while remaining highly extensible and
adaptable. Using a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark
matter halo, we thoroughly validate the algorithm's precision, efficiency, and
functionality, and investigate how dark matter halo parameters affect
observational signatures. Our results demonstrate that increasing the scale and
density of the dark matter halo strengthens the spacetime's gravitational
field, an effect clearly reflected in black hole images and supported by
hot-spot light curve signatures. A future version of OCTOPUS, with expanded
capabilities for axisymmetric spacetimes, is planned for release.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general method to prove the non-degeneracy of
the Hessian in the spinfoam vertex amplitude for quantum gravity and apply it
to the spinfoam models with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-SF models). By
reformulating the problem in terms of the transverse intersection of some
submanifolds in the phase space of flat ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections,
we demonstrate that the Hessian is non-degenerate for critical points
corresponding to non-degenerate, geometric 4-simplices in de Sitter or anti-de
Sitter space. Non-degeneracy of the Hessian is an important necessary condition
for the stationary phase method to be applicable. With a non-degenerate
Hessian, this method not only confirms the connection of the $\Lambda$-SF model
to semiclassical gravity, but also shows that there are no dominant
contributions from exceptional configurations as in the Barrett-Crane model.
Given its general nature, we expect our criterion to be applicable to other
spinfoam models under mild adjustments.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Motivated by the century-old problem of modeling the electron as a pointlike
particle with finite self energy, we develop a new class of nonlinear
perturbations of Maxwell's electrodynamics inspired by, but distinct from, the
Born--Infeld theory. A hallmark of our construction is that the effective
radius of an electric point charge can be reduced arbitrarily by tuning a
coupling parameter, thereby achieving scales far below the Born--Infeld bound
and consistent with the experimentally undetected size of the electron. The
models preserve finite self energy for point charges while energetically
excluding monopoles and dyons, a robustness that appears intrinsic to this
class of nonlinear theories. Two complementary behaviors are uncovered: In the
non-polynomial perturbations, the Maxwell limit is not recovered as the
coupling vanishes, whereas in polynomial models the self energy diverges
correctly, meaning that the Maxwellian ultraviolet structure is reinstated. A
further subtlety emerges in the distinction between the prescribed source
charge, imposed through the displacement field, and the measurable free charge
arising from the induced electric field. In particular, the free charge and the
self energy contained within any ball around the point charge tend to zero in
the strong-nonlinearity or zero effective-radius limit, rendering a pointlike
structure locally undetectable, both electrically and energetically. These
findings highlight how nonlinear field equations reconcile theoretical
prescription with experimental measurement and suggest a classical rationale
for the effective invisibility of the electron substructure.

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a variable-order springpot model for predicting the long-term deformation of polymers under constant stress, addressing the limitations of fixed-order models by dynamically adapting to material phase changes during creep.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to improve the accuracy of predicting the time-dependent deformation of polymers, which is crucial for their use in structural applications.

Method: The paper introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model based on fractional calculus. The model parameters are calibrated using the cross-entropy (CE) method, allowing it to dynamically adapt to changes in material viscoelastic properties during creep.

Result: The VO springpot model outperforms fixed-order models by accurately capturing the power-law behavior of creep deformation across different material phases.

Conclusion: This advancement provides a reliable tool for predicting the long-term performance of polymers in structural settings and opens new possibilities for modeling other viscoelastic materials.

Abstract: Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant
stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common
misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected
over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental
creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like
springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the
power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional
calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship;
however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the
deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order
(VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic
properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between
glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a
robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE)
method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This
advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the
fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics
to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting
long-term material performance in structural applications.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separators and spectrometers (MR-ToF MSs) used in radioactive ion beam facilities. It highlights their potential for resolving rare isomeric states with high precision, but notes current limitations. A new high-voltage MR-ToF MS is proposed for the FRIB facility, which could significantly increase ion throughput and improve performance, even surpassing certain mass resolving powers. Mitigation strategies for non-ideal conditions are discussed, showing potential for achieving exceptionally high mass resolving powers in the future.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exploration of new techniques for mass spectrometry in radioactive ion beams is essential for advancing nuclear physics and isotope research.

Method: The paper employs simulations and theoretical analysis of MR-ToF MS performance under non-ideal conditions, comparing different configurations and strategies.

Result: The research suggests that with effective mitigation of non-ideal conditions, the new high-voltage MR-ToF MS could achieve mass resolving powers exceeding previous records by up to an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: This study advocates for advanced mitigation techniques to enhance the capabilities of MR-ToF MS, particularly for applications requiring high mass resolving powers in FRIB's setup.

Abstract: Multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separators and spectrometers (MR-ToF
MSs) are indispensable tools at radioactive ion beam (RIB) facilities. These
electrostatic ion beam traps act as highly selective mass separators and
high-precision mass spectrometers for rare and exotic nuclei. When well-tuned
and designed to minimize higher-order flight-time aberrations, state-of-the-art
MR-ToF MSs approach, and slightly exceed, mass resolving powers of \( m /
\Delta m = 10^6 \). Achieving \( m / \Delta m > 3 \cdot 10^6 \) would provide
the ability to resolve \( >90\% \) of all known isomeric states with half-lives
above 10~\text{ms}. However, the ability to mass separate in all practical
setups is limited by non-ideal conditions which place such resolving powers out
of reach. To this end, we present a simulated analysis of these conditions in
the newly proposed high-voltage MR-ToF MS for the Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams (FRIB). It is expected to store ions at 30~\text{keV} beam energy and
increase ion throughput by two orders of magnitude compared to current devices.
Existing efforts to mitigate the effects of non-ideal conditions employed for
current MR-ToF devices storing ions at \( <3~\text{keV} \) beam energy will
already enable mass resolving powers approaching \( 10^6 \) for FRIB's
high-voltage MR-ToF device. Simulations of newly proposed mitigation strategies
show that even mass resolving powers approaching \( 10^7 \) might become
feasible.

TL;DR: The paper derives analytical solutions for diagonal and off-diagonal functions in the ETH for a quantum billiard, demonstrating how Berry's conjecture relates to band structure and bandwidth scaling, and suggesting that thermalization occurs through loss of initial condition information in single-particle and few-body systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the relationship between the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and Berry's conjecture, particularly in a quantum billiard system.

Method: The authors use a semiclassical approach to derive analytical expressions for the diagonal and off-diagonal functions in the ETH, then compare these with numerical results to validate the analytical solutions.

Result: The analytical solutions predict the bandwidth and scaling behavior of the observable matrix, and the paper shows that these results are consistent with Berry's conjecture.

Conclusion: The study establishes a connection between the ETH and Berry's conjecture in a quantum billiard system, highlighting the role of classical dynamics in determining quantum thermalization processes.

Abstract: We derive semiclassical analytical solutions for both the diagonal and
off-diagonal functions in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in a

explicit expression and an asymptotic closed-form solution that naturally
separate into a local contribution and a phase-space correlation term. These
analytical results predict the band structure of the observable matrix,
including its bandwidth and scaling behavior. We further demonstrate that our
analytical formula is equivalent to the prediction of Berry's conjecture.
Supported by numerical evidence, we show that Berry's conjecture captures the
energetic long-wavelength behavior in the space of eigenstates, while our
analytical solution describes the asymptotic behavior of the f function in the
semiclassical limit. Finally, by revealing the connection between the bandwidth
scaling and the underlying classical dynamics, our results suggest that the ETH
carries important physical implications in single-particle and few-body
systems, where "thermalization" manifests as the loss of information about
initial conditions.

*Laura Sáez-Ortuño,Santiago Forgas-Coll,Massimiliano Ferrara*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores applying quantum kernel methods to a real-world consumer classification task in the NISQ regime, introducing a hybrid Q-SVM pipeline that outperforms classical and quantum baselines, suggesting potential for NISQ-era applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors motivate the study of quantum kernel methods in practical machine learning tasks, recognizing the potential of quantum computing in NISQ-era hardware despite its limitations.

Method: A hybrid pipeline combining quantum-kernel Support Vector Machine (Q-SVM) and quantum feature extraction (QFE) modules was developed and benchmarked against classical and quantum baselines.

Result: The proposed Q-SVM achieved high accuracy metrics (0.7790 accuracy, 0.7647 precision, 0.8609 recall, etc.), indicating strong performance even with NISQ hardware constraints.

Conclusion: The results suggest that quantum kernel methods can be effective for practical classification tasks, providing a foundation for integrating quantum computing into real-world applications, albeit with room for improvement and further research.

Abstract: This work studies the feasibility of applying quantum kernel methods to a
real consumer classification task in the NISQ regime. We present a hybrid
pipeline that combines a quantum-kernel Support Vector Machine (Q-SVM) with a
quantum feature extraction module (QFE), and benchmark it against classical and
quantum baselines in simulation and with limited shallow-depth hardware runs.
With fixed hyperparameters, the proposed Q-SVM attains 0.7790 accuracy, 0.7647
precision, 0.8609 recall, 0.8100 F1, and 0.83 ROC AUC, exhibiting higher
sensitivity while maintaining competitive precision relative to classical SVM.
We interpret these results as an initial indicator and a concrete starting
point for NISQ-era workflows and hardware integration, rather than a definitive
benchmark. Methodologically, our design aligns with recent work that formalizes
quantum-classical separations and verifies resources via XEB-style approaches,
motivating shallow yet expressive quantum embeddings to achieve robust
separability despite hardware noise constraints.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum reflection is a fascinating signature of the quantum vacuum that
emerges from inhomogeneities in the electromagnetic fields. In pursuit of the
prospective real-world implementation of quantum reflection in the
back-reflection channel, we provide the first numerical estimates for the
light-by-light scattering with dipole pulses, which are known to provide the
tightest focusing of light possible. For an all-optical setup with a dipole
pump and Gaussian probe of the same frequency, we find that the dominant signal
signature is related mainly to the back-reflection channel from 4-wave mixing.
Focusing on this, we study the particular case of a multiple focusing pulses
configuration (belt configuration) as an approximation to the idealized dipole
pulse. Using Bayesian optimization methods, we determine optimal parameters
that maximize the detectability of a discernible back-reflection signal. Our
study indicates that the optimization favors a three-beam collision setup,
which we further investigate both numerically and analytically.

*Klaudia Dilcher,Piotr Bania,Diana Mendez-Avalos,Aleksandra Sierant,Morgan W. Mitchell,Jan Kolodynski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses Bayesian methods for estimating magnetic fields using spin-precession magnetometers in free-induction decay mode. The methods studied include Bayesian Cramér-Rao bounds, prediction error method, extended Kalman filter, and cubature Kalman filter. The study indicates that while PEM provides the best precision, EKF and CKF are computationally efficient and nearly optimal. EKF is particularly effective for tracking fluctuating and unknown transient signals. The methods are applicable to other sensors with nonlinear dynamics and Gaussian noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetic field monitoring is essential for applications like magnetic navigation and physics beyond the standard model. Accurate and efficient methods for estimating magnetic fields can enhance these applications.

Method: The paper employs Bayesian signal-recovery methods, specifically the Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound, prediction error method (PEM), extended Kalman filter (EKF), and cubature Kalman filter (CKF), to analyze the precision and performance of spin-precession magnetometers in free-induction decay mode.

Result: The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound determines the ultimate precision in estimating the Larmor frequency. PEM achieves this precision but is computationally expensive. EKF and CKF offer near-optimal tracking with computational efficiency, outperforming only CKF for large spin numbers. EKF is effective for tracking fluctuating and unknown transient signals. The methods are applicable to other sensors with nonlinear dynamics and Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: This paper provides valuable insights into Bayesian methods for magnetic field monitoring, demonstrating the applicability and efficiency of EKF and related filters for tracking magnetic fields beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Precise, real-time monitoring of magnetic field evolution is important in
applications including magnetic navigation and searches for physics beyond the
standard model. One main field-monitoring technique, the spin-precession
magnetometer (SPM), observes electron, nucleus, color center, or muon spins as
they precess in response to their local magnetic field. Here, we study Bayesian
signal-recovery methods for SPMs in the free-induction decay (FID) mode. In
particular, we study tracking of field changes well within the coherence time
of the spin system, and thus well beyond the response bandwidth, as in [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 120, 040503 (2018)]. We derive the Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound
that dictates the ultimate precision in estimating the Larmor frequency, which
we show to be attained by the computationally-expensive prediction error method
(PEM). Relative to this benchmark, we show that the extended Kalman filter
(EKF) and cubature Kalman filter (CKF) offer near-optimal tracking that is also
computationally efficient, with the use of the latter giving better results
only for large spin number. Focusing thus on the EKF, we show that it is
sufficient to accurately track fluctuating and unknown transient signals. Our
methods can be easily adapted to other types of sensors undergoing non-linear
dissipative dynamics and experiencing intrinsic Gaussian-like stochastic
noises.

Method: 作者运用了复分析和 resurgence 理论，结合连接公式和路径积分方法，系统地研究了不同势如谐振子和 Coulomb 势的能谱。

Result: 作者计算了一个闭合路径，该路径从 $+ty$ 出发，经过 $r<0$ 区域包裹原点后回到 $+ty$，展示了这是能谱计算的关键路径。此外，作者提出该闭合路径上的一部分在 $r=0$ 处具有物理意义，可用作通过从 $0$ 到 $+ty$ 的开放路径的基底。

Conclusion: 本文通过径向 Schrödinger 问题的重新分析，展示了复分析与 resurgence 理论结合下的量子化条件，探讨了数学和物理边界条件的协调，为量子力学的路径选择提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We revisit exact WKB quantization for radial Schr\"odinger problems from the
modern resurgence perspective, with emphasis on how ``physically meaningful''
quantization paths should be chosen and interpreted. Using connection formulae
at simple turning points and at regular singular points, we show that the
nontrivial-cycle data give the spectrum. In particular, for the $3$-dimensional
harmonic oscillator and the $3$-dimensional Coulomb potential, we explicitly
compute a closed contour which starts at $+\infty$, bulges into the $r<0$
sector to encircle the origin, and returns to $+\infty$. Also we propose that
the appropriate slice of the closed path provides a physical local basis at
$r=0$, which is used by an origin-to-$\infty$ open path. Our analysis
clarifies, in radial settings, how mathematical monodromy data and physical
boundary conditions dovetail, thereby addressing recent debates on path choices
in resurgence-based quantization.

Abstract: We introduce time-dependent variational principles to study the non-unitary
dynamics of open quantum many-body systems, including dynamics described by the
full Lindblad master equation, the non-Hermitian dynamics corresponding to the
no-click limit of the fully post-selected quantum trajectories, and the
dynamics described by a hybrid Lindbladian with a control parameter $\alpha$
which interpolates between the full post-selection and averaging over all
quantum trajectories. As an application we study the non-unitary dynamics of a
lossy or driven-dissipative BCS superconductors, evolving in presence of
two-body losses and two-body pumps. We show that the non-Hermitian limit acts
as a singular limit of the hybrid dissipative dynamics, leading to a sharp
modification of the universal approach to the driven-dissipative steady-states.
By considering the dissipative dynamics with pair losses, we show that, as the
non-Hermitian limit is approached, the density dynamics sharply evolves from a
universal power-law to exponential decay that converges towards a quasi-steady
plateau characterized by the freezing of the particle depletion due to pair
losses. The reached quasi-stationary density increases as a function of the
dissipation rate highlighting the emergence of a non-Hermitian Zeno effect in
the lossy dynamics. For the driven-dissipative case, we show that, in the
non-Hermitian limit, the system gets trapped into an effective negative
temperature state, thus skipping the infinite temperature steady-state reached
in the presence of finite contribution of the quantum jumps. We rationalize
these findings in terms of the conservation of the length of the pseudospins
which, in the non-Hermitian limit, suppresses the effective single-particle
losses and pumps acting on the non-condensed particles.

Abstract: Universal aspects of thermalization in interacting many-body systems are
typically challenging to derive microscopically, yet provide a powerful
framework for understanding emergent phenomena. Here, we numerically study the
mean-field dynamics of a $(2+1)$D spin system with thousands of spins and show
that experimentally-feasible two-body Ising interactions can stabilize a
prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge structure with dynamical matter,
manifested by a gauge-invariant plateau with exponentially long lifetime.
Eventually, the metastable prethermal $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure breaks
down via a proliferation of Gauss' law defects, similar to bubble formation in
false vacuum decay. In this regime, we discover spatio-temporal correlations
described by a non-linear surface growth consistent with the $(1+1)$D
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. We benchmark our results in small
systems against semi-classical discrete time Wigner approximation (DTWA) and
exact diagonalization (ED), where the breakdown of DTWA signals the emergence
of an extensive number of local symmetries that strongly influence the
thermalization pathway. Our model provides a testbed for quantum simulators and
is directly implementable in large-scale arrays of Rydberg atoms.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of Coulomb potential systems in thermal

absorption spectrum of an atomic system under isotropic thermal environment,
with systematic variation of system-bath coupling strength and temperature.

TL;DR: Neural quantum states (NQS) have a maximum entanglement entropy of $S emain c k	extlog n$ for any subset, constraining their capacity to area law entangled states, but they surpass matrix product states' limitations with $O(1)$ nonlinearities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the expressive limits of quantum states, especially NQS, is vital for advancing quantum computing and many-body physics.

Method: Used mathematical analysis with assumptions of analyticity to derive an entropy bound, then verified with numerical simulations.

Result: Proven an area law bound for NQS with specific nonlinearities, aligning with matrix product states but surpassing their limitations.

Conclusion: NQS exhibit a constrained yet powerful entanglement capacity, providing deeper insights into quantum state expressiveness.

Abstract: Variational wavefunctions offer a practical route around the exponential
complexity of many-body Hilbert spaces, but their expressive power is often
sharply constrained. Matrix product states, for instance, are efficient but
limited to area law entangled states. Neural quantum states (NQS) are widely
believed to overcome such limitations, yet little is known about their
fundamental constraints. Here we prove that feed-forward neural quantum states
acting on $n$ spins with $k$ scalar nonlinearities, under certain analyticity
assumptions, obey a bound on entanglement entropy for any subregion: $S \leq c
k\log n$, for a constant $c$. This establishes an NQS analog of the area law
constraint for matrix product states and rules out volume law entanglement for
NQS with $O(1)$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate analytically and numerically
that the scaling with $n$ is tight for a wide variety of NQS. Our work
establishes a fundamental constraint on NQS that applies broadly across
different network designs, while reinforcing their substantial expressive
power.

Result: 确定了只有R-para粒子能在三维中噪声鲁棒地赢得挑战，并通过这种方法区分了不同统计行为。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和分类新的拓扑量子状态提供了新的工具。

Abstract: We show that a family of secret communication challenge games naturally
define a hierarchy of emergent quasiparticle statistics in three-dimensional
(3D) topological phases. The winning strategies exploit a special class of the
recently proposed $R$-paraparticles to allow nonlocal secret communication
between the two participating players. We first give a high-level, axiomatic
description of emergent $R$-paraparticles, and show that any physical system
hosting such particles admits a winning strategy. We then analyze the games
using the categorical description of topological phases (where point-like
excitations in 3D are described by symmetric fusion categories), and show that
only $R$-paraparticles can win the 3D challenge in a noise-robust way, and the
winning strategy is essentially unique. This analysis associates emergent
$R$-paraparticles to deconfined gauge theories based on an exotic class of
finite groups. Thus, even though this special class of $R$-paraparticles are
fermions or bosons under the categorical classification, their exchange
statistics can still have nontrivial physical consequences in the presence of
appropriate defects, and the $R$-paraparticle language offers a more convenient
description of the winning strategies. Finally, while a subclass of non-Abelian
anyons can win the game in 2D, we introduce twisted variants that exclude
anyons, thereby singling out $R$-paraparticles in 2D as well. Our results
establish the secret communication challenge as a versatile diagnostic for both
identifying and classifying exotic exchange statistics in topological quantum
matter.

Result: 通过构建 2D 随机 Ashkin-Teller 模型，得到tCNOT门将bit-flip错误阈值降低至8%，相比toric code减少了26%。同时，error syndrome 的传播效应降低了阈值至2.8%，相比toric code减少了7%。

Conclusion: 我们构建了一种统计力学映射，成功将正交位门操作的错误传播效应转化为可计算的物理量，从而推导出在transversal Clifford 电路下错误传播对容错门槛的影响，结果表明这种错误传播会导致容错门限显著降低。

Abstract: The threshold theorem promises a path to fault-tolerant quantum computation
by suppressing logical errors, provided the physical error rate is below a
critical threshold. While transversal gates offer an efficient method for
implementing logical operations, they risk spreading errors and potentially
lowering this threshold compared to a static quantum memory. Available
threshold estimates for transversal circuits are empirically obtained and
limited to specific, sub-optimal decoders. To establish rigorous bounds on the
negative impact of error spreading by the transversal gates, we generalize the
statistical mechanical (stat-mech) mapping from quantum memories to logical
circuits. We establish a mapping for two toric code blocks that undergo a
transversal CNOT (tCNOT) gate. Using this mapping, we quantify the impact of
two independent error-spreading mechanisms: the spread of physical bit-flip
errors and the spread of syndrome errors. In the former case, the stat-mech
model is a 2D random Ashkin-Teller model. We use numerical simulation to show
that the tCNOT gate reduces the optimal bit-flip error threshold to $p=0.080$,
a $26\%$ decrease from the toric code memory threshold $p=0.109$. The case of
syndrome error coexisting with bit-flip errors is mapped to a 3D random 4-body
Ising model with a plane defect. There, we obtain a conservative estimate error
threshold of $p=0.028$, implying an even more modest reduction due to the
spread of the syndrome error compared to the memory threshold $p=0.033$. Our
work establishes that an arbitrary transversal Clifford logical circuit can be
mapped to a stat-mech model, and a rigorous threshold can be obtained
correspondingly.

results unify non-Hermitian Floquet physics with spectral geometry and provide

The use of lead (Pb) as the superconducting component is chosen due to its bulk superconducting gap and critical temperature, which offer unique advantages in proximity effects and the generation of large gate-tunable superconducting gaps.

Method: The researchers developed three-terminal Pb-hybrid nanowire devices and employed nonlocal differential-conductance spectroscopy to investigate the electronic properties. This experimental setup allowed them to probe the proximity-induced superconducting gaps and the Andreev bound states (ABSs) within the system. They also utilized a gate-tuning technique to manipulate the system's parameters and observe how these changes affect the physical properties. The theoretical part of the study focused on understanding the behavior of ABSs and their interaction with quantum dots (QDs).

Result: The key findings include the observation of a dual-gap structure: the parent Pb gap and a large, tunable induced superconducting gap. The researchers successfully identified Andreev bound states within the induced gap and observed their singlet-doublet transitions. By applying gate voltages, they achieved control over the resonating sign of the nonlocal conductance, identifying distinct quantum-dot resonance regimes (single-resonance, double-resonance, and series-resonance). Additionally, they demonstrated that the coupling between ABSs and QDs could be adjusted from weak to strong coupling limits. Importantly, the nonlocal signatures were observed to persist up to temperatures as high as ~1K, significantly higher than the operating temperatures of Al-based devices. This result opens up the possibility of implementing high-temperature topological quantum devices and artificial Kitaev chains using Pb-based hybrids.

Conclusion: This study establishes lead-hybrid nanowires as a robust platform for exploring topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The large gate-tunable superconducting gap in Pb devices, combined with their high operating temperature, makes them a promising candidate for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing, especially considering the potential for implementing warm-temperature artificial Kitaev chains.

Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor(SC-SM) nanowires remain one of the
foremost platforms for engineering topological superconductivity and Majorana
zero modes(MZMs) towards fault-tolerant topological qubits, especially with the
rapid development of artificial Kitaev chains. In contrast to the widely used
aluminum(Al)-based hybrids, lead(Pb) offers a bulk superconducting gap of
~1.4meV and a critical temperature of ~7.2K, giving rise to a proximity-induced
gap that is roughly five times larger than that obtained with Al. Here we
present the first three-terminal Pb-hybrid devices and perform nonlocal
differential-conductance spectroscopy on this platform. The nonlocal
measurement simultaneously resolves a dual-gap feature of the parent Pb gap and
the large, hard, gate-tunable induced superconducting gap, distinguished by a
switch between electron- and hole-like dissipation processes. Within the
induced gap we observe several types of Andreev bound states(ABSs) that undergo
singlet-doublet transitions. Moreover, by tuning gate voltages we achieve
gate-controlled resonating sign reversals of the nonlocal conductance,
identifying three distinct regimes that correspond to different configurations
of quantum-dot(QD) resonances(single-resonance, double-resonance, and
series-resonance). Finally, the coupling between ABSs and QDs also present and
can be modulated from the weak- to strong-coupling limit, indicating the
feasibility of realizing the artificial Kitaev chains. Crucially, the robust
nonlocal signatures persist up to temperatures(~1K) far above the operating
temperature of Al-based devices thanks to the unusually large induced gap,
thereby widening the accessible parameter space greatly and underscoring the
suitability of Pb-based hybrids for implementing warm temperature artificial
Kitaev chains and the topological quantum devices protected by a substantially
larger topological gap.

Conclusion: This is a significant step toward scalable, highly efficient quantum heat engines based on collective effects.

Abstract: We present a thermal engine that exploits the \emph{cooperative
superradiance} and \emph{superabsorption} of a sample of \(N\) two-level atoms.
This engine operates using a single cold reservoir via cycles of collective
pumping followed by decay. Using an effective mean-field Hamiltonian to
describe the many-body dynamics, we design optimized drive pulses that preserve
adiabaticity and achieve an average power output scaling quadratically with the
system size, \(P \propto N^2\). An experimentally measurable figure of merit
demonstrates that the efficiency of this superengine can approach unity. The
resulting analytical model, which yields a representative Hamiltonian for the
sample within the mean-field formalism, is validated by numerical simulations.
Our results pave the way for scalable and highly efficient quantum heat engines
based on collective effects.

Abstract: We propose a framework to characterize the correlations in qubit systems for
Bell and prepare-and-measure scenarios with independent devices -- a typically
non-convex problem. Based on this result, we introduce protocols for referring
devices and detecting entanglement with correlation that are not necessarily
extreme or nonlocal, as required by common linear approach. } Specifically, our
correlation criterion, derived from uncertainty relation specific to qubit
systems, can capture the non-convex nature of the set of correlations arising
from Bell and prepare-and-measure scenarios, as demonstrated through concrete
examples. Conversely, when given an observed correlation, our framework can
refer potential measurements and quantum states -- which are sometimes uniquely
determined -- even with correlations that are not extreme. This extends common
protocols that merely verify devices using extreme correlations. We then
enhance entanglement detection for qubit system by incorporating the inferred
information in Navascu\'{e}s-Pironio-Ac\'{i}n (NPA) hierarchy, showing that
some local correlations can also verify entanglement. Since the scenarios
considered here are standard platforms for most quantum information protocols
and device inference is a central issue in quantum information science, our
methodology, which is well-suited to these tasks, may provide a foundation for
a broad range of applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce hierarchical random walks at first. In this

global walker chooses a local walker at every step, then the chosen local
walker moves a single step. After that we construct the corresponding
continuous-time quantum walks and discuss its spectral structures. Then we
define multi-dimensional continuous-time quantum walk by taking a marginal
distribution respect to the global walker.

Abstract: The coherent emission of multiple atoms gives rise to superradiance, a
cornerstone phenomenon in quantum optics with wide-ranging applications in
quantum information processing and precision metrology. Despite its importance,
how the superradiant scaling with respect to the number of participating atoms

investigate a cavity-QED system and demonstrate that atom-photon coupling can
significantly alter the emission behavior--suppressing the collective
superradiant scaling while enhancing the scaling associated with individual
atomic emissions. Our study provides a pathway toward controllable collective
emission in state-of-the-art experimental platforms.

*Yangyu Lu,Yifei Huang,Dong An,Qi Zhao,Dingshun Lv,Xiao Yuan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Adiabatic evolution is a central paradigm in quantum physics, but digital simulation is costly due to algorithmic errors accumulating over time. This work demonstrates that digital adiabatic evolution is intrinsically accurate and robust to simulation errors. Two methods, Trotterization and generalized quantum signal processing, are analyzed, showing that simulation error does not increase with time. Numerical simulations confirm the theory, highlighting the substantial efficiency improvement of digital adiabatic evolution compared to previously assumed methods. The estimation for the first-order Trotterization error is significantly tighter than previous analyses, even with a small number of qubits. The findings confirm the fundamental robustness of digital adiabatic evolution and provide a basis for accurate, efficient implementations on fault-tolerant and potentially near-term quantum platforms.

Motivation: This paper is motivated by the challenge of performing accurate quantum simulations, which is critical for advancing quantum computing and quantum technologies. The potential for practical applications in simulating molecular systems and solving linear equations suggests that this work could have significant implications for various fields that rely on quantum algorithms.

Method: The authors analyze two Hamiltonian simulation methods: Trotterization and generalized quantum signal processing. They prove that the simulation error does not increase with time and perform numerical simulations to confirm their theoretical findings. The improved error estimation for the first-order Trotterization error is specifically highlighted.

Result: The key results of this paper are: (1) Digital adiabatic evolution is intrinsically accurate and robust to simulation errors, contrary to previous beliefs that it requires deep circuits to maintain accuracy. (2) Both the Trotterization and generalized quantum signal processing methods are shown to have bounded errors that do not increase with time. (3) Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis for both molecular systems and linear equations. (4) The estimation for the first-order Trotterization error is significantly tighter than previous analyses, even with a small number of qubits.

Conclusion: This work provides a solid theoretical foundation for the accuracy and robustness of digital adiabatic evolution, demonstrating that it is more efficient and less error-prone than previously assumed. The practical implications of these findings are significant for the development of quantum algorithms and quantum technologies, particularly for near-term quantum platforms and applications in simulating complex quantum systems.

Abstract: Adiabatic evolution is a central paradigm in quantum physics. Digital
simulations of adiabatic processes are generally viewed as costly, since
algorithmic errors typically accumulate over the long evolution time, requiring
exceptionally deep circuits to maintain accuracy. This work demonstrates that
digital adiabatic evolution is intrinsically accurate and robust to simulation
errors. We analyze two Hamiltonian simulation methods -- Trotterization and
generalized quantum signal processing -- and prove that the simulation error
does not increase with time. Numerical simulations of molecular systems and
linear equations confirm the theory, revealing that digital adiabatic evolution
is substantially more efficient than previously assumed. Remarkably, our
estimation for the first-order Trotterization error can be 10^6 times tighter
than previous analyses for the transverse field Ising model even with less than
6 qubits. The findings establish fundamental robustness of digital adiabatic
evolution and provide a basis for accurate, efficient implementations on
fault-tolerant -- and potentially near-term -- quantum platforms.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum state preparation remains a dominant cost in many quantum algorithms.
We introduce a randomized protocol that fundamentally improves the
accuracy-cost trade-off for states with hierarchical amplitude structures,
where amplitudes decay exponentially or by a power law with exponent greater
than one. Rather than commonly employed deterministically truncating small
amplitudes, we prepare an ensemble of simple circuits: each retains all large
amplitudes while amplifying a single small one. We rigorously prove that the
randomized ensemble achieves a quadratic improvement in trace-distance error
over the deterministic truncation method. This quadratic scaling halves the
number of encoded amplitudes for exponential decay and yields polynomial
reductions for power-law decay, which directly translates to a reduction in
circuit depth. Demonstrations on molecular wavefunctions (LiH), many-body
ground states (transverse-field Ising), and machine-learning parameters
(ResNet) validate the approach across diverse applications. The method broadens
the class of states preparable on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.

Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) plays a critical role in building the
distributed quantum networks. Device-independent (DI) QSS provides the highest
security level for QSS. However, the photon transmission loss and extremely low
multipartite entanglement generation rate largely limit DI QSS's secure photon
transmission distance and practical key generation efficiency. To address the
above drawbacks, we propose the quantum memory-assisted (QMA) DI QSS protocol
based on single photon sources (SPSs). The single photons from the SPSs are
used to construct long-distance multipartite entanglement channels with the
help of the heralded architecture. The heralded architecture enables our
protocol to have an infinite secure photon transmission distance in theory. The
QMA technology can not only increase the multi-photon synchronization
efficiency, but also optimize the photon transmittance to maximize the
construction efficiency of the multipartite entanglement channels. Our protocol
achieves the practical key generation efficiency seven orders of magnitude
higher than that of the existing DI QSS protocols based on cascaded spontaneous
parametric down-conversion sources and six orders of magnitude higher than that
of the DI QSS based on SPSs without QMA. Our protocol has modular
characteristics and is feasible under the current experimental technical
conditions. Combining with the advanced random key generation basis strategy,
the requirement on experimental devices can be effectively reduced. Our
protocol is expected to promote the development of long-distance and
high-efficiency DI quantum network in the future.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds promise for computational advantage, yet
progress on real-world tasks is hindered by classical preprocessing and noisy
devices. We introduce ViT-QCNN-FT, a hybrid framework that integrates a
fine-tuned Vision Transformer with a quantum convolutional neural network
(QCNN) to compress high-dimensional images into features suited for noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. By systematically probing
entanglement, we show that ansatzes with uniformly distributed entanglement
entropy consistently deliver superior non-local feature fusion and
state-of-the-art accuracy (99.77% on CIFAR-10). Surprisingly, quantum noise
emerges as a double-edged factor: in some cases, it enhances accuracy (+2.71%
under amplitude damping). Strikingly, substituting the QCNN with classical
counterparts of equal parameter count leads to a dramatic 29.36% drop,
providing unambiguous evidence of quantum advantage. Our study establishes a
principled pathway for co-designing classical and quantum architectures,
pointing toward practical QML capable of tackling complex, high-dimensional
learning tasks.

TL;DR: This paper characterizes the onset of classicality by combining quantum Darwinism with quantum metrology, showing that quantum Fisher information measures the rate of classical objectivity emergence.

Motivation: Understanding the emergence of classicality from quantum systems is a fundamental question in quantum theory. This paper addresses it by integrating concepts from quantum metrology and quantum Darwinism.

Method: The authors employ quantum Fisher information to measure the rate of classicality emergence. They analyze a spin-star model using optimal and suboptimal measurements to demonstrate their findings.

Result: Optimal measurements cause classicality to emerge exponentially, while suboptimal measurements still reach the Cramér-Rao bound. The framework bridges quantum Darwinism with information acquisition.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach to understanding classicality emergence through information theory, offering practical insights for quantum metrology applications.

Abstract: We present a precise characterization of the onset of classicality that
combines the formalism of quantum Darwinism with the tools from quantum
metrology. We show that the quantum Fisher information provides a useful metric
for assessing the rate at which classical objectivity emerges. Furthermore, our
formalism allows us to explore how the choice of measurement impacts the
precision with which an observer can determine the state of the system. For a
paradigmatic example of the spin-star model, we demonstrate that optimal
measurements lead to the emergence of classicality at an exponential rate.
Although other measurements necessarily lead to slower emergence, we
importantly show that suboptimal measurements can still saturate the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. By recasting emergent classicality as an information
acquisition protocol, our framework provides a precise operational description
of quantum Darwinism.

Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to offer significant advantages in solving
complex optimization problems that are challenging for classical computers.
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems represent an
important class of problems with relevance in finance and logistics. The
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a prominent candidate for
solving QUBO problems on near-term quantum devices. In this paper, we
investigate the performance of both the standard QAOA and the adaptive
derivative assembled problem tailored QAOA (ADAPT-QAOA) to solve QUBO problems
of varying sizes and hardnesses with a focus on its practical applications in
financial feature selection problems. Our main observation is that ADAPT-QAOA
significantly outperforms QAOA with hard problems (trade-off parameter {\alpha}
= 0.6) when comparing approximation ratio and time-to-solution. However, the
standard QAOA remains efficient for simpler problems. Additionally, we
investigate the practical feasibility and limitations of QAOA by scaling
analysis based on the real-device calibration data for various hardware
platforms. Our estimates indicate that standard QAOA implemented on
superconducting quantum computers provides a shorter time-to-solution compared
to trapped-ion devices. However, trapped-ion devices are expected to yield more
favorable error rates. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the
challenges, trade-offs, and strategies for deploying QAOA-based methods on
near-term quantum hardware.

Motivation: Understanding and analyzing quantum many-body states is crucial for advancing quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. This paper aims to bridge the gap by introducing SnapshotRG as a versatile tool for such analysis.

Method: The authors propose SnapshotRG, an exact renormalization group transformation that can be applied to datasets from quantum simulator experiments. The method is real-space based but can also be generalized to abstract data spaces. It provides a framework for characterizing quantum many-body systems more broadly.

Result: SnapshotRG reveals self-similarity in datasets during continuous phase transitions. This finding helps explain the scale-freeness observed in wavefunction networks, indicating that scale invariance applies not just to conventional correlation functions but also to the full statistical structure of quantum states.

Conclusion: SnapshotRG offers a powerful new tool for studying quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena. Its implementation with numerical methods like neural quantum states opens up new possibilities for characterizing quantum matter across various platforms.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulator experiments enable unprecedented access
to quantum many-body states through snapshot measurements of individual
many-body configurations. Here, we introduce an exact renormalization group
(RG) transformation that can be directly applied to any such snapshot dataset.
Our SnapshotRG operates in real space, but can also be directly translated to
an RG in the abstract dataspace of measurement configurations, providing a
framework for the characterization of quantum many-body systems on a more
general level. We demonstrate that snapshot datasets in dataspace exhibit
self-similarity at continuous phase transitions, providing an explanation for
the recently observed scale-freeness of so-called wavefunction networks. As a
consequence, scale invariance extends beyond traditional low-order correlation
functions to encompass the full statistical structure of quantum states as
contained in their snapshot datasets. Our SnapshotRG can be readily implemented
with snapshot data generated by numerical method such as neural quantum states
or any quantum simulation platform, offering a versatile tool for
characterizing quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena in quantum

TL;DR: An improved transpilation method for quantum circuits using 2D neural guided sampling outperforms existing tools like Qiskit and BQSKit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies on efficient circuit optimization to mitigate errors, and transpilation is a critical step in this process. Existing methods often struggle with scalability and optimization efficiency.

Method: This work introduces a novel transpilation technique that employs 2D neural networks to guide sampling during the optimization process. The neural networks analyze a 2D representation of the quantum circuit to predict gate groups that can be reduced.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better results in circuit reduction compared to existing tools such as Qiskit and BQSKit.

Conclusion: The use of 2D neural networks in transpilation shows promise for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of quantum circuit optimization.

Abstract: Translating a general quantum circuit on a specific hardware topology with a
reduced set of available gates, also known as transpilation, comes with a
substantial increase in the length of the equivalent circuit. Due to
decoherence, the quality of the computational outcome can degrade seriously
with increasing circuit length. Thus, there is major interest to reduce a
quantum circuit to an equivalent circuit which is in its gate count as short as
possible. One method to address efficient transpilation is based on approaches
known from stochastic optimization, e.g. by using random sampling and token
replacement strategies. Here, a core challenge is that these methods can suffer
from sampling efficiency, causing long and energy consuming optimization time.
As a remedy, we propose in this work 2D neural guided sampling. Thus, given a
2D representation of a quantum circuit, a neural network predicts groups of
gates in the quantum circuit, which are likely reducible. Thus, it leads to a
sampling prior which can heavily reduce the compute time for quantum circuit
reduction. In several experiments, we demonstrate that our method is superior
to results obtained from different qiskit or BQSKit optimization levels.

Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by
axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum
relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in
equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support
through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and
thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum
processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden
units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having
fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot
distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and
max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These
rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a
multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its
operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the
athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of
athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity
distillation and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work
connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and
maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing

Abstract: A central concept in quantum information processing is genuine multipartite
entanglement (GME), a type of correlation beyond biseparability, that is,
correlations that cannot be explained by statistical mixtures of partially
separable states. GME is relevant for characterizing and benchmarking complex
quantum systems, and it is an important resource for applications such as
quantum communication. Remarkably, it has been found that GME can be activated
from multiple copies of biseparable quantum states, which do not possess GME
individually. Here, we experimentally demonstrate unambiguous evidence of such
GME activation from two copies of a biseparable three-qubit state in a
trapped-ion quantum processor. These results not only challenge notions of
quantum resources but also highlight the potential of using multiple copies of
quantum states to achieve tasks beyond the capabilities of the individual
copies.

*Eric Buffenoir*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common dismissal of the 1936 quantum logic program by Birkhoff and von Neumann, arguing that it can be used to establish quantum theory's foundational principles like contextuality, no-broadcasting, and Bell non-locality despite the restrictions imposed by no-go theorems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to revisit and reinterpret the quantum logic program, which was previously dismissed due to theoretical limitations, by relaxing these constraints and demonstrating its potential to rebuild quantum theory's essential principles.

Method: The authors start from scratch, assuming only the existence of a tensor product and a star involution to define quantum logics, rather than building upon the traditional framework established by von Neumann.

Result: By constructing quantum logics under these relaxed assumptions, the authors show that these structures are inherently linked to irreducible Hilbert geometries and demonstrate key quantum properties such as contextuality, the no-broadcasting theorem, and Bell non-locality.

Conclusion: This work suggests that the quantum logic program, when reinterpreted, has the capability to establish the foundational aspects of quantum theory that were originally envisioned by Birkhoff and von Neumann.

Abstract: The quantum logic program originated in a 1936 article by G. Birkhoff and J.
von Neumann. This program is generally disregarded due to no-go theorems
restricting the existence of the tensor product of elementary quantum logics
and, above all, the impossibility of considering entangled states and Bell
non-local states within the framework of these composite quantum logics. We
revisit this study from the beginning and reverse the perspective. Here, the
existence of a tensor product and a star involution are the only prerequisites
for the definition of the state spaces. Surprisingly, the quantum logics
constructed in this way turn out to have a close connection with irreducible
Hilbert geometries, even though we did not impose this sort of structure ab
initio. Endly, the existence of some basic quantum-like properties is
explicitly proven in our framework : contextuality, no-broadcasting theorem,

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has been widely applied in the field of quantum
information, notably in tasks such as entanglement detection, steering
characterization, and nonlocality verification. However, few studies have
focused on utilizing machine learning to detect quantum information masking. In
this work, we investigate supervised machine learning for detecting quantum
information masking in both pure and mixed qubit states. For pure qubit states,
we randomly generate the corresponding density matrices and train an XGBoost
model to detect quantum information masking. For mixed qubit states, we improve
the XGBoost method by optimizing the selection of training samples. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the area under the curve (AUC)
of the receiver operating characteristic curve for this method, which further
confirms its classification performance.

Abstract: Light-matter interactions within the strong-field regime, where intense laser
fields can ionise a target via tunnelling, give rise to fascinating phenomena
such as the generation of high-order harmonic radiation (HHG). On the atomic
scale, these strong-field processes are described in terms of
highly-oscillatory time integrals which are often approximated using
saddle-point methods. These methods simultaneously simplify the calculations
and let us understand the physical processes in terms of semi-classical
electron trajectories, or quantum orbits. However, applying saddle-point
methods for HHG driven by polychromatic laser fields without clear dynamical
symmetries has remained challenging. Here we introduce Picard-Lefschetz theory
as a universal and robust link between the time integrals and the
semi-classical trajectories. The continuous deformation of the integration
contour towards so-called Lefschetz thimbles allows an exact evaluation of the
integral, as well as the identification of relevant quantum orbits, for
arbitrary driving fields. The latter is realised via the ``necklace
algorithm'', a novel solution to the open problem of determining the relevance
of saddle points for a two-dimensional integral, which we introduce here. We
demonstrate the versatility and rigour of Picard-Lefschetz methods by studying
Stokes transitions and spectral caustics arising in HHG driven by two-colour
laser fields. For example, we showcase a quantum-orbit analysis of the colour
switchover, which links the regime of perturbative two-colour fields with that
of fully bichromatic driving fields. With this work, we set the foundation for
a rigorous application of quantum-orbit based approaches in attosecond science
that enables the interpretation of state-of-the-art experimental setups, and
guides the design of future ones.

Motivation: Improving single photon sources in quantum technology is crucial for secure quantum communication and quantum computing.

Method: The paper presents a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a time-multiplexed heralded single photon source based on SPDC, calculating source characteristics like purity and heralding efficiency.

Result: The demonstration includes accurate modeling and analysis of the source effectiveness, and the paper provides an approximation of the single photon probability after time multiplexing.

Conclusion: The work represents a step forward in achieving reliable single photon sources for quantum applications, with explicit calculations of important metrics and an approximate probability quantification after multiplexing.

Abstract: In the field of quantum technology, single photons have emerged as a pivotal
resource, prompting the development of heralded single photon sources (HSPS)
with enhanced generation probability. The majority of such sources are based on
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), but they exhibit a low single
photon generation probability. The multiplexing principle
(arXiv:quant-ph/0205103) has been proposed as a solution to this problem. This
paper presents a demonstration of a time-multiplexed HSPS based on the SPDC
process, including accurate calculations and modeling of key source
characteristics, specifically purity and heralding efficiency. Furthermore, the
paper provides an analysis and approximation of the probability of a single
photon post-application of time multiplexing.

Abstract: Unclonable cryptography leverages the quantum no-cloning principle to
copy-protect cryptographic functionalities. While most existing works address
the basic single-copy security, the stronger notion of multi-copy security
remains largely unexplored.
  We introduce a generic compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant unclonable
primitives to achieve multi-copy security, assuming only one-way functions.
Using this framework, we obtain the first multi-copy secure constructions of
public-key quantum money (termed quantum coins), single-decryptor encryption,
unclonable encryption, and more. We also introduce an extended notion of
quantum coins, called upgradable quantum coins, which allow weak
(almost-public) verification under weaker assumptions and can be upgraded to
full public verification under stronger assumptions by the bank simply
publishing additional classical information.
  Along the way, we give a generic compiler that upgrades single-copy secure
single-decryptor encryption to a collusion-resistant one, assuming the
existence of functional encryption, and construct the first multi-challenge
secure unclonable encryption scheme, which we believe are of independent
interest.

Abstract: Identification of cancer driver genes is fundamental for the development of
targeted therapeutic interventions. The integration of mutational profiles with
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks offers a promising avenue for their
detection [ 1, 2], but scaling to large network datasets is computationally
demanding. Quantum computing offers compact representations and potential
complexity reductions. Motivated by the classical method of Gumpinger et al.
[3], in this work we introduce a supervised quantum framework that combines
mutation scores with network topology via a novel state preparation scheme,
Quantum Multi-order Moment Embedding (QMME). QMME encodes low-order statistical
moments over the mutation scores of a node's immediate and second-order
neighbors, and encodes this information into quantum states. These are used as
inputs to a kernel-based quantum binary classifier that discriminates known
driver genes from others. Simulations on an empirical PPI network demonstrate
competitive performance, with a 12.6% recall gain over a classical baseline.
The pipeline performs explicit quantum state preparation and requires no
classical training, enabling an efficient, nearly end-to-end quantum workflow.
A brief complexity analysis suggests the approach could achieve a quantum
speedup in network-based cancer gene prediction. This work underscores the
potential of supervised quantum graph learning frameworks to advance biological
discovery.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Molecular quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) may provide low-power,
high-speed computational hardware for processing classical information.
Simulation and modeling play an important role in the design of QCA circuits
because fully-coherent models of QCA scale exponentially with the number of
devices, and such models are severely limited in size. For larger circuits,
approximations become necessary. In the era of fault-tolerant quantum
computation, however, it may become possible to model large QCA circuits
without such limitations. Presently, this work explores the use of the
noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)
method for estimating the ground state of QCA circuits. This is relevant
because the computational result of a QCA calculation is encoded in the
circuit's ground state. In this study, VQE is used to model logic circuits,
including binary wires,
  inverters, and majority gates. VQE models are performed ideal simulators,
noisy simulators, and actual quantum hardware. This study demonstrates that VQE
may indeed be used to model molecular QCA circuits. It is observed that using
modern NISQ hardware, results are still quite sensitive to noise, so measures
should be taken to minimize noise. These include simplifying the ansatz circuit
whenever possible, and using low-noise hardware.

Conclusion: 提出了基于错误相关性的解码器，可显著提高多模式 GKP 码在量子计算中的应用效果。

Abstract: In order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing, we make use of quantum
error correction schemes designed to protect the logical information of the
system from decoherence. A promising way to preserve such information is to use
the multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding, which encodes logical
qubits into several harmonic oscillators. In this work, we focus on decoding
the measurements obtained from Steane-type quantum error correction protocols
for multimode GKP codes. We propose a decoder that considers the noise present
on the auxiliary states, more specifically by tracking the correlations between
errors on different modes spreading throughout the error-correction circuit. We
show that leveraging the correlations between measurement results and the
actual error affecting the multimode GKP state can decrease the logical error
probability by at least an order of magnitude, yielding more robust quantum
computation.

Conclusion: 该研究通过确定精确的Hamming距离区间，为量子分类提供了一种可靠的新评估工具，适用于任何量子分类算法。

Abstract: This article investigates the probabilistic relationship between quantum
classification of Boolean functions and their Hamming distance. By integrating
concepts from quantum computing, information theory, and combinatorics, we
explore how Hamming distance serves as a metric for analyzing deviations in
function classification. Our extensive experimental results confirm that the
Hamming distance is a pivotal metric for validating nearest neighbors in the
process of classifying random functions. One of the significant conclusions we
arrived is that the successful classification probability decreases
monotonically with the Hamming distance. However, key exceptions were found in
specific classes, revealing intra-class heterogeneity. We have established that
these deviations are not random but are systemic and predictable. Furthermore,
we were able to quantify these irregularities, turning potential errors into
manageable phenomena. The most important novelty of this work is the
demarcation, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, of precise
Hamming distance intervals for the classification probability. These intervals
bound the possible values the probability can assume, and provide a new
foundational tool for probabilistic assessment in quantum classification.
Practitioners can now endorse classification results with high certainty or
dismiss them with confidence. This framework can significantly enhance any
quantum classification algorithm's reliability and decision-making capability.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of noise on measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits, demonstrating that constant local noise disrupts volume-law scaling, implying potential for efficient tensor-network algorithms under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the impact of noise on quantum circuit entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum computing and error correction.

Method: The research examines operator entanglement through 2D circuit simulations with varying noise levels and circuit depths, using numerical methods to analyze scaling behaviors.

Result: Results show that noise leads to an area-law scaling of entanglement, suggesting efficient algorithms for shallow or noise-resilient circuit depths.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into noise-induced limitations of quantum circuits and opens avenues for developing efficient algorithms for processing such circuits.

Abstract: We study measurement-induced entanglement generated by column-by-column
sampling of noisy 2D random Clifford circuits of size $N$ and depth $T$.
Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced
boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth
transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace
noise at any constant rate $p>0$, the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ attained along the
sampling trajectory obeys an area law in the boundary length and scales
approximately linearly with $T/p$. By analyzing the spatial distribution of
stabilizer generators, we observe exponential localization of stabilizer
generators; this both accounts for the scaling of the maximal $S_{\rm op}$ and
implies an exponential decay of conditional mutual information across buffered
tripartitions, which we also confirm numerically. Together, these results
indicate that constant local noise destroys long-range, volume-law
measurement-induced entanglement in 2D random Clifford circuits. Finally, based
on the observed scaling, we conjecture that a tensor-network-based algorithm
can efficiently sample from noisy 2D random Clifford circuits (i) at
sub-logarithmic depths $T = o(\log N)$ for any constant noise rate $p =
\Omega(1)$, and (ii) at constant depths $T = O(1)$ for noise rates $p =
\Omega(\log^{-1}N)$.

Abstract: Photons are central to quantum technologies, with photonic qubits offering a

out for their ability to generate single photons on demand, a key capability
for enabling long-distance quantum networks. In this work, we utilize
high-purity single-photon sources based on self-assembled InAs(Ga)As quantum
dots as quantum information carriers. We demonstrate that such on-demand single
photons can generate quantum contextuality. This capability enables a novel
protocol for semi-device-independent quantum key distribution over free-space
channels. Crucially, our method does not require ideal or perfectly projective
measurements, opening a new pathway for robust and practical quantum

Abstract: We introduce a novel method that simultaneously isolates a quantum computer
from decoherence and enables the controlled implementation of computational
gates. We demonstrate a quantum computing model that utilizes a qubit's motion
to protect it from decoherence. We model a qubit interacting with a quantum
field via the standard light-matter interaction model: an Unruh-DeWitt
detector, i.e., the qubit, follows a prescribed classical trajectory while
interacting with a scalar quantum field. We switch off the rotating-wave terms,
i.e., the resonant transitions, using the technique of acceleration-induced
transparency which eliminates the dominant decoherence channels by controlling
the qubit's trajectory. We are able to perform one-qubit gates by stimulating
the counter-rotating wave terms (i.e., the non-resonant transitions) and
two-qubit gates by extracting the entanglement from the quantum field prepared
in a squeezed state. Finally, we discuss the fundamental limits on quantum
error protection: on the trade-off between isolating a quantum computer from
decoherence, and the speed with which entangling gates may be applied,
comparable to the Eastin-Knill theorem for quantum error correction.

*Yu-Zhen Janice Chen,Laurent Massoulié,Don Towsley*

TL;DR: Gaussian Boson Sampling's (GBS) capability to detect planted bicliques in graphs presents significant computational challenges within the presumed classical hard regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the computational advantages of quantum devices like GBS is crucial for advancing quantum computing applications, particularly in scenarios where classical methods fall short.

Method: The study focuses on analyzing a specific GBS output statistic—the node weight, which measures how often a node appears in GBS samples. By rigorously analyzing the distribution of node weights and the bias introduced by the planted biclique structure, the researchers assess the effectiveness of simple ranking strategies in distinguishing the planted nodes from background nodes.

Result: The analysis reveals that when the planted biclique size is within the conjectured hard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal, making it unreliable to use simple ranking strategies for detection. This finding provides the first rigorous evidence that detecting planted bicliques may remain computationally hard even with GBS-based quantum computing.

Conclusion: These findings suggest that further investigation into more sophisticated GBS-based algorithms or alternative quantum approaches is needed to overcome the computational challenges associated with detecting planted bicliques within the classical hard regime.

Abstract: We investigate whether Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) can provide a
computational advantage for solving the planted biclique problem, which is a
graph problem widely believed to be classically hard when the planted structure
is small. Although GBS has been heuristically and experimentally observed to
favor sampling dense subgraphs, its theoretical performance on this classically
hard problem remains largely unexplored. We focus on a natural statistic
derived from GBS output: the frequency with which a node appears in GBS
samples, referred to as the node weight. We rigorously analyze whether this
signal is strong enough to distinguish planted biclique nodes from background
nodes. Our analysis characterizes the distribution of node weights under GBS
and quantifies the bias introduced by the planted structure. The results reveal
a sharp limitation: when the planted biclique size falls within the conjectured
hard regime, the natural fluctuations in node weights dominate the bias signal,
making detection unreliable using simple ranking strategies. These findings
provide the first rigorous evidence that planted biclique detection may remain
computationally hard even under GBS-based quantum computing, and they motivate
further investigation into more advanced GBS-based algorithms or other quantum
approaches for this problem.

Abstract: The original concept of left-handed material has inspired the possibility of
optical antimatter, where the effect of light propagation through a medium can
be completely cancelled by its complementary medium. Despite recent progress in
the development of negative-index metamaterials, losses continue to be a
significant barrier to realizing optical antimatter. In this work, we show that
passive, lossy materials can be used to realize optical antimatter when
illuminated by light at a complex frequency. We further establish that one can
engineer arbitrary complex-valued permittivity and permeability in such
materials. Strikingly, we show that materials with a positive index at real
frequencies can act as negative-index materials under complex frequency
excitation. Using our approach, we numerically demonstrate the optical
antimatter functionality, as well as double focusing by an ideal perfect lens
and superscattering. Our work demonstrates the power of temporally structured
light in unlocking the promising opportunities of complementary media, which
have until now been inhibited by material loss.

Abstract: Polaritons are usually described within single-mode cavity QED models.
However, nanophotonic environments typically involve several modes that
spectrally overlap and interfere, giving rise to sharp dip features such as
Fano profiles in the electromagnetic spectral density. Here, we identify these
features as interference-induced resonances, effective electromagnetic modes
with complex, non-Hermitian couplings to quantum emitters. We show that these
modes hybridize with emitters to form polaritons even when the system
parameters do not satisfy the single-mode strong-coupling criterion. Moreover,
the resulting polaritons differ in their decay rates, a phenomenon we term
imaginary Rabi splitting. Extending the analysis to ensembles, we find that
coupling to interference-induced resonances produces long-lived polaritons that
can outlast excitonic dark states. Numerical simulations of a realistic hybrid
metallodielectric platform confirm these predictions and demonstrate their
robustness against disorder and loss. Our results reveal a new polaritonic
regime beyond the single-mode description, offering new opportunities for
controlling light-matter interactions in complex electromagnetic environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a
dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via
subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant
near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description
remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for
the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission
spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are
generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid
nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is
necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to
showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal
position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the
sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism
can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference,
including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and
quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the
method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g.,
conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the
coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective
resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study,
understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.

Abstract: In recent decades, there has been an increasing demand for faster modulation
schemes. Electro-optic modulators are essential components in modern photonic
systems, enabling high-speed control of light for applications ranging from
telecommunications to quantum communication. Conventional inline and
Mach-Zehnder modulators, while widely adopted, are limited by bias drift, high
operating voltages, and polarization-mode dispersion. Sagnac loop-based
modulators have recently emerged as a promising alternative, offering inherent
stability against environmental fluctuations and eliminating the need for
active bias control. In this work, we present a comprehensive model of the
Sagnac modulator that captures both intensity and polarization modulation. We
analyze the role of asymmetry in the loop, highlighting its impact on the
achievable repetition rate, and propose modulation strategies to overcome these
constraints. Finally, we investigate the symmetric Sagnac configuration and
demonstrate practical techniques for achieving robust modulation while
mitigating experimental challenges. Our results establish the Sagnac modulator
as a versatile and stable platform for next-generation photonic and quantum
communication systems.

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development of metasurfaces using Sb₂S₃ for all-optical light modulation, highlighting their high efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high demand for efficient data transmission and the potential of metasurfaces in telecommunication systems drive this research.

Method: The study focuses on monolithic and hybrid metasurfaces using Sb₂S₃, a phase change material. They employ a magnetic dipole as a low-Q resonance. The method includes both experimental and simulation approaches.

Result: The Sb₂S₃ metasurfaces achieve high modulation depths (~91-99%) with low optical loss (k < 10⁴). Hybrid structures reduce power usage by ~2-fold while maintaining high modulation depth.

Conclusion: This work provides an effective and scalable solution for all-optical light modulation, with strong potential for integration into CMOS-compatible photonic circuits and future telecommunications systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for more efficient data transmission has made nanoscale
high-throughput all-optical switching a critical requirement in modern
telecommunication systems. Metasurface-based platforms offer unique advantages
because of their compact design, energy efficiency, and the ability to
precisely manipulate light at the subwavelength scale, in a contact-less
fashion. However, achieving both high transmission modulation and low optical
loss in the telecom band remains a challenge. This study develops monolithic
and hybrid metasurfaces based on the phase change material antimony trisulfide
(Sb$_2$S$_3$) to address this limitation. First, we demonstrate the capability
of Sb$_2$S$_3$ to offer up to ~91 percent modulation, even with a magnetic
dipole - a low-Q resonance. It lifts the requirement for complex precisely
fabricated metasurfaces, a long-standing limitation in the community for all
optical switching. Furthermore, with the most straightforward hybridisation
approach, i.e. depositing a thin film of silicon, we improved the simulated
modulation depth to 99 percent. Experimentally, over 80 percent modulation was
achieved for both hybrid and monolithic structures, with nearly 2-fold less
power required for switching in the hybrid design whilst maintaining high
modulation depth. This performance results from the significant refractive
index tunability of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and its intrinsically low optical loss (k <
10^{-4}) in the telecom band, further enhanced by silicon integration. The
demonstrated metasurfaces offer an effective and scalable approach for
all-optical light modulation with strong potential for integration into
CMOS-compatible photonic circuits and next-generation telecommunications
systems.

*Ouri Karni,Chirag Vaswani,Thibault Chervy*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: An ultrafast intra-cavity optical gating scheme using a femtosecond pulse in a high-finesse, nonlinear microcavity enhances light-matter interaction, enables real-time control, and supports advanced quantum operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for advanced quantum state storage and real-time light-matter interaction control has driven the development of ultrafast optical gating techniques in high-finesse optical cavities.

Method: A femtosecond optical gate pulse tuned to the cavity's transparency region used sum-frequency generation to up-convert the intra-cavity field. The upconverted signal exited as a short pulse, providing on-demand access to the cavity's state.

Result: The gating scheme successfully demonstrated intra-cavity mode excitation and up-conversion, with validation through analytical models and efficient instantiation of cavity modes on femtosecond timescales.

Conclusion: This innovative approach provides a foundation for advanced quantum state manipulation, enabling future developments in quantum storage, retrieval, and real-time control of light-matter interactions in low-temperature micro cavities.

Abstract: Recent advances in optical simulation and computational techniques have
renewed interest in high-finesse optical cavities for applications such as
enhancing light-matter interactions, engineering complex photonic band
structures, and storing quantum information. However, the extended interaction
times enabled by these cavities often come at the cost of slow optical read-out
protocols and limited control over system transients. To address this
challenge, we demonstrate an ultrafast intra-cavity optical gating scheme in a
high-finesse, second-order nonlinear microcavity incorporating a thin-film of
lithium niobate. A femtosecond optical gate pulse -- tuned to the transparency
region of the cavity's dielectric mirrors -- achieves instantaneous
up-conversion of the intra-cavity field via sum-frequency generation. The
resulting upconverted signal exits the cavity as a short pulse, providing
space- and time-resolved, on-demand access to the intra-cavity state. We
validate this approach by tracking the dynamics of multiple resonant modes
excited in a plano-concave distributed Bragg reflector microcavity, showing
close agreement with analytical models. Additionally, we demonstrate that
stimulated intra-cavity difference-frequency generation can efficiently
instantiate cavity modes on femtosecond timescales. This gating scheme is fully
compatible with low-temperature microcavity experiments, paving the way for
advanced quantum state storage, retrieval, and real-time control of
light-matter interactions.

*Abbas Shiri,Kenneth L. Schepler,Ayman F. Abouraddy*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Planar Fabry-P{é}rot cavities cannot efficiently enhance ultrashort pulse fields due to their resonance filtering limitations, but introducing angular dispersion can lead to omni-resonance for broader bandwidth enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a limitation in nonlinear optical interaction enhancement using ultrafast pulses, aiming to bridge ultrafast optics with resonant photonics.

Method: The authors introduced angular dispersion into ultrafast pulses to achieve omni-resonance, where pulses can couple to a single long cavity resonance even beyond typical linewidth constraints.

Result: By utilizing omni-resonance, the cavity achieved intra-cavity peak intensity enhancements comparable to focused pulses across their entire bandwidth, facilitating efficient amplification and broad bandwidth applications.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities for resonant enhancement of nonlinear optical effects over broad bandwidths, potentially advancing all-optical signal processing technologies.

Abstract: High-finesse planar Fabry-P{\'e}rot (FP) cavities spectrally filter the
incident field at discrete resonances, and thus cannot be utilized to
resonantly enhance the field of ultrashort pulses. Introducing judicious
angular dispersion into a pulse can give rise to `omni-resonance', whereby the
entire bandwidth of a spatiotemporally structured ultrafast pulse couples to a
single longitudinal cavity resonance, even when the pulse bandwidth far exceeds
the resonant linewidth. Here we show that omni-resonance increases the
intra-cavity peak intensity above that of a pulse having equal energy and
bandwidth when tightly focused in free space -- maintained across its entire
bandwidth and along a cavity longer than the Rayleigh length of the focused
pulse. This paves the way towards broadband resonant enhancement of nonlinear
optical effects, thereby bridging the gap between ultrafast optics and resonant
photonics.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Bilayer meta-gratings with asymmetric structural parameters can guide light in one direction via unidirectional guide resonances. The Goos-H"{a}nchen shifts show two unusual behaviors: resonant peaks with constant transmittance and reflectance, and shifts not always proportional to resonance quality. These are explained by interference effects and group velocity proportional shifts, with numerical simulations illustrating the phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the unique optical properties of bilayer meta-gratings is crucial for applications in optical manipulation and sensing, making this research highly relevant.

Method: The study employs a combination of temporal coupled mode theory analysis and numerical simulations using Gaussian beams with finite widths to explore the behavior of Goos-H"{a}nchen shifts.

Result: The research reveals two anomalous behaviors of Goos-H"{a}nchen shifts: resonant peaks with constant transmission and reflection properties, and shifts not always linked to resonance quality. Theoretical analysis using group velocity supports these findings.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive understanding of Goos-H"{a}nchen shifts in bilayer meta-gratings, offering insights that are essential for advancing optical devices and applications.

Abstract: Bilayer meta-gratings with asymmetric structural parameters could host
unidirectional guide resonances. The distribution of unidirectional guide
resonances in the space of structural parameters and synthetic parameters is
identified. As the incident optical beam being resonant with the unidirectional
guide resonance, the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts of the scattered beams
exhibit two anomalous behaviors: the resonant peak of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen
shift is accompanied by constant transmittance and reflectance; the magnitude
of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift is not always proportional to the quality
factor of the unidirectional guide resonance. The temporal coupled mode theory
analysis reveals that the first anomalous behavior is due to interference
between direct scattering and radiation from the unidirectional guide
resonance; the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shifts are proportional to the group
velocity as well as the quality factor of the unidirectional guide resonance.
Numerical simulations of incidence of Gaussian beam with finite beam width
provide intuitive visualization of the Goos-H$\ddot{a}$nchen shift.

TL;DR: This paper presents a transformative approach in photonic systems by introducing hyper-spectral photonic integrated circuits (HS-PICs), which exponentially increase spectral complexity as the number of components increases. This is achieved through recursive inverse design, allowing even a single waveguide to achieve sub-picometer resolution, surpassing current spectrometers and enabling simultaneous optical and radio signal monitoring within a single device.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is the demand for highly complex spectral responses in advanced computing and sensing applications, which often require high throughput. Current methods using cascading components only scale linearly, thus limiting complexity. The paper aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The authors introduce HS-PICs, which utilize recursive inverse design to exploit intricate inter-component interactions as design freedoms. This approach significantly expands the design space for spectral engineering. The method demonstrates that even a single waveguide can achieve sub-picometer resolution, surpassing state-of-the-art spectrometers.

Result: The key results include the exponential scaling of spectral complexity with the number of components, enabling sub-picometer resolution in a single waveguide. This surpasses the performance of current spectrometers and bridges optical and microwave frequencies, allowing simultaneous monitoring of optical and radio signals within a single device.

Conclusion: This work revolutionizes next-generation computing and sensing technologies by providing a framework that significantly enhances spectral analysis capabilities, opening new possibilities in optical and radio signal processing.

Abstract: Spectrum manipulation is central to photonic systems, where advanced
computing and sensing applications often demand highly complex spectral
responses to achieve high throughput. Conventional methods for enhancing
spectral complexity typically rely on cascading discrete photonic components,
resulting in a complexity that scales only linearly with the number of
components. Here, we introduce hyper-spectral photonic integrated circuits
(HS-PICs), in which spectral complexity scales exponentially with the number of
components. This is achieved through recursive inverse design - a system-level
inverse design strategy that exploits intricate inter-component interactions as
design freedoms, thereby substantially expanding the design space for spectral
engineering. Using this approach, we demonstrate that even a single waveguide
structure can resolve spectra with sub-picometer resolution, surpassing the
performance of current state-of-the-art spectrometers. This performance bridges
optical and microwave frequencies in spectral analysis, enabling simultaneous
monitoring of optical and radio signals within a single device. Our work
establishes a transformative framework for next-generation computing and

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the successful combination of Brillouin active cooling and precooling using liquid nitrogen to achieve a 69% reduction in the phonon population of a 7.608 GHz acoustic mode, resulting in a final temperature of 24.3 K, which is 50 K lower than previously reported.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work was to achieve high-quality cooling of high-frequency acoustic modes, specifically in the 7-8 GHz range, demonstrating practicality and efficiency in cold atom physics and precision cooling applications.

Method: The cooling was achieved by combining Brillouin active cooling with precooling using liquid nitrogen. The setup involved a waveguide where thermal phonons were actively reduced, and liquid nitrogen was used to precool the system to 77 K before applying the active cooling mechanism.

Result: The experiment successfully achieved a 69% reduction in the thermal phonon population of a 7.608 GHz acoustic mode, leading to a final temperature of 24.3 K, surpassing previous records by 50 K.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in the field of active phonon cooling, showcasing the feasibility and effectiveness ofBrillouin cooling combined with precooling techniques for achieving ultra-low temperatures in precision cooling applications.

Abstract: Thermal phonons are a major source of decoherence in quantum mechanical
systems. Operating in the quantum ground state is therefore often an
experimental prerequisite. Additionally to passive cooling in a cryogenic
environment, active laser cooling enables the reduction of phonons at specific
acoustic frequencies. Brillouin cooling has been used to show efficient
reduction of the thermal phonon population in waveguides at GHz frequencies
down to 74 K. In this letter, we demonstrate cooling of a 7.608 GHz acoustic

Abstract: Quasinormal modes characterise the transient response of static optical
cavities. Here, we introduce the notion of a Floquet quasinormal mode to
describe transient responses in photonic time crystals. Contrasting their
static counterparts, exceptional points associated with symmetry transitions
are an inherent feature, as modes spontaneously and non-perturbatively lock
their phase to the oscillations of the material. We further investigate the
limiting behaviour of the Floquet quasinormal modes in large cavities. Distinct
non-perturbative behaviour arises in time-modulated systems as increasingly
large time-crystal cavities come closer to achieving the maximum gain predicted
from a bulk wavenumber bandgap.

TL;DR: The paper compares the use of solids and liquids for ultrafast nonlinear optics, concluding that liquids like 1-decanol offer a stable, non-volatile alternative with similar nonlinearity to solids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in overcoming the limitations of solids in ultrafast nonlinear optics, such as sensitivity to damage, and exploring alternative media with better stability.

Method: The authors generated a supercontinuum in 1-decanol spanning an octave from the visible to near-infrared. They measured the nonlinear index of refraction, specifically noting a significant $n_4$ contribution, which they found to be comparable in high-intensity regimes to CS$_2$ but with less volatility.

Result: The study found that 1-decanol's supercontinuum spectrum maintained stability for at least 30 minutes, demonstrating its potential as a stable medium for ultrafast applications.

Conclusion: 1-decanol emerges as a promising liquid alternative to solid materials for nonlinear optical processes, balancing nonlinearity with enhanced stability.

Abstract: Although solids have been recently used in ultrafast experiments for spectral
broadening due to their relatively high nonlinearity, their sensitivity to
damage limits their long-term stability. Liquids are a possible alternative to
solids as a nonlinear medium because of their comparable nonlinearity and
resistance to permanent damage. We generate a supercontinuum in 1-decanol that
spans more than an octave from the visible to the near-infrared regime. We
measure the nonlinear index of refraction of 1-decanol and find a significant
$n_4$ contribution. This contribution leads to a nonlinearity comparable to
CS$_2$ (a frequent reference for nonlinear optics) in high-intensity regimes
while being significantly less volatile and toxic. We find this supercontinuum
spectrum to be stable for at least 30 minutes.

Abstract: We present a new computational near-eye display method that addresses the

accommodation-invariance. Our system integrates a refractive lens eyepiece with
a novel wavefront coding diffractive optical element, operating in tandem with
a pre-processing convolutional neural network. We employ end-to-end learning to
jointly optimize the wavefront-coding optics and the image pre-processing
module. To implement this approach, we develop a differentiable retinal image
formation model that accounts for limiting aperture and chromatic aberrations
introduced by the eye optics. We further integrate the neural transfer function
and the contrast sensitivity function into the loss model to account for
related perceptual effects. To tackle off-axis distortions, we incorporate
position dependency into the pre-processing module. In addition to conducting
rigorous analysis based on simulations, we also fabricate the designed
diffractive optical element and build a benchtop setup, demonstrating
accommodation-invariance for depth ranges of up to four diopters.
