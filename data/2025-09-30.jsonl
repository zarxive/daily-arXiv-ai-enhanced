Such\nfs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light\nthat are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while\nsimultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high\npeak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique\ntools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time\nrequired to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling,\nfrom the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse\nenergy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via\ndiffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence,\nthe fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or\nablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred\nnanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable\nnonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation\nand relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the\nreasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials\nprocessing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids.\nWe identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision\nor the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or\nprocessing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and\nquestions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered."}

Starting from the fundamental principles of conservation of mass,\nmomentum, and energy, a continuum mechanical framework is introduced that\ncaptures the main multiphysical effects. A numerical solution using the Finite\nVolume Method is presented and validated against benchmark problems where\ndetailed experimental data are available.

Extending ultracold\nmolecular complexity to polyatomic molecules, such as triatomic and tetratomic\nmolecules, has attracted considerable interest. However, the realization of\nultracold polyatomic molecules remains technically challenging due to their\ncomplex energy-level structures. While only a few experiments have successfully\ndemonstrated the formation of polyatomic molecules by magnetoassociation or\nelectroassociation, here we present the first step toward producing tetratomic\nmolecules through the development of a microwave association technique combined\nwith microwave dressing. When the two lowest rotational states of the molecules\nare dressed by a microwave field, weakly bound tetramer states emerge in the\nentrance channel with free dark excited states $\\ket{0}$ and a dressed state\n$\\ket{+}$. The spectroscopy of these weakly bound tetramers is probed by\nanother microwave field that drives transitions from the populated dressed\nstates $\\ket{+}$. By precisely discriminating the complex hyperfine structure\nof the dark excited level $\\ket{0}$ from the dressed-state spectroscopy, the\nbinding energy of the tetratomic molecules is measured and characterized. Our\nwork contributes to the understanding of complex few-body physics within a\nsystem of microwave-dressed molecules and may open an avenue toward the\ncreation and control of ultracold polyatomic molecules."}

Five oxidizing\nenvironments at atmospheric pressure are investigated: air, pure oxygen, and\nmixtures containing 40% oxygen (by mole) diluted with nitrogen, helium, or\nargon. The burning droplet peak temperature, measured by three-colour\npyrometry, increases by 337 K from air to pure oxygen. The peak temperature of\nthe silicon droplet in the 40%O2-60%He mixture is lower than that in the\n40%O2-60%Ar mixture, in contradiction with thermodynamic predictions, due to a\nhigher Lewis number of the helium-diluted mixture. Although oxygen diffusivity\nis higher in the helium-diluted mixture, a lower burning rate is observed,\nattributed to the lower combustion temperature. High-speed colour camera\nobservations reveal that the square of the particle diameter decreases with\ntime in each combustion run, following a strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.99)\nacross all oxidizing environments. However, the combustion lifetime is\nproportional to the initial particle diameter to the power of n, with n ranging\nfrom 1.69 to 1.82. This deviation from the expected n = 2 appears to result\nfrom unavoidable measurement uncertainties and the limited particle size range,\nrather than differences in combustion physics. The decrease in silicon droplet\nsize during combustion is attributed to the formation of gaseous SiO as an\nintermediate combustion product.

Their high\npeak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique\ntools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time\nrequired to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling,\nfrom the electronic system of the solid to its lattice.

Within this framework, we develop Graph Builder, a deterministic\ngeneration algorithm that achieves substantial reductions (up to an order of\nmagnitude) in two-qubit gate usage for both random and structured graphs,\ncompared with alternative approaches. The algorithm uses the minimum number of\nemitters possible for a fixed emission sequence, while also supporting the use\nof extra emitters for controlled trade-offs between emitter count and other\ncost metrics. Moreover, by systematically identifying the degrees of freedom at\neach stage of the generation process, this framework fully characterizes the\noptimization landscape, enabling analytic, heuristic, or exhaustive strategies\nfor further cost reductions. Our approach provides a general and versatile tool\nfor designing and optimizing emitter-based photonic graph state generation\nprotocols, essential for scalable and resource-efficient photonic quantum\ninformation processing."}

It is observed that small metric perturbations initially have\na limited impact on the less damped black hole quasinormal modes, and\ndeviations typically around their unperturbed values, a phenomenon first\nderived by Skakala and Visser in a more restrictive context. In the higher\novertone region, the deformation propagates, amplifies, and eventually gives\nrise to spectral instability and, inclusively, bifurcation in the quasinormal\nmode spectrum. While deterministic metric perturbations give rise to a deformed\nbut well-defined quasinormal spectrum, random perturbations lead to\nuncertainties in the resulting spectrum. Nonetheless, the primary trend of the\nspectral instability remains consistent, being sensitive to both the strength\nand location of the perturbation. However, we demonstrate that the observed\nspectral instability might be suppressed for metric perturbations that are\nphysically appropriate."}

It may\ntherefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these\nother assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received\nsignificant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical\nindependence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of\nSI, which states that $\\rho(\\lambda) \\approx \\rho(\\lambda | Z)$, where\n$\\rho(\\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in\nthe state $\\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into\napparently randomly selected sub-ensembles.

We argue that physical theories that\nsystematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This\nperspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in\nthe superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and\nphilosophical consequences.

This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which\nselectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's\nbottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the\ntopological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the\ninterface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the\ntopological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our\nplatform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's\ntopologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent\nsimulations, self-consistent Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson calculations, and\nlarge-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness.\nOur work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological\nsuperconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems."}

Floquet codes are a class of\ndynamically generated, stabilizer-based codes in which low-weight parity\nmeasurements are applied in a time-periodic schedule. Furthermore, for several\nFloquet codes, the encoding rate becomes finite even for an infinitely large\nqubit number. However, despite these advantageous properties, existing Floquet\ncodes require handling more intricate, often hypergraph-structured syndromes\nfrom the decoding perspective, which makes decoding comparatively demanding. We\ngive a concrete method for solving this issue by proposing hyperbolic color\nFloquet (HCF) code. To this end, we simultaneously take advantage of hyperbolic\nFloquet and Floquet color codes. Parity measurements in our code consist of the\nrepetitions of six-step measurements on (semi-)hyperbolic three-colorable\ntilings. Since each step just measures $X \\otimes X$ or $Z \\otimes Z$, our code\non the regular $\\{8,3\\}$ lattice has the following three advantages: (i) parity\nmeasurements are weight-2, (ii) for the numbers $k$ and $n$ of logical and\nphysical qubits, respectively, the encoding rate is finite, i.e., $\\lim_{n \\to\n\\infty} k/n = 1/8$, and (iii) the code distance is proportional to $\\log n$.\nFrom the above property, each single-fault event generally affects at most two\ndetectors, which implies ``graph-edge'' syndromes, and hence decoding with a\nminimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is efficient and virtually\nscales near-linearly in the number of physical qubits $n$. This is a stark\ncontrast to several known Floquet codes because their parity measurements\nrepeat the measurements of $X\\!\\otimes\\!X$, $Y\\!\\otimes\\!Y$, and\n$Z\\!\\otimes\\!Z$, and thus the syndromes are represented as a hypergraph, which\nbasically requires decoders with longer decoding time."}

In this free-theory regime, no genuine\nthermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the\nevent horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an\napparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from\nthe horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true\nequilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal\nonly with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal\nbehaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole\ninterior."}

However, low-angular-momentum\n($\\ell$) laser-accessible Rydberg levels have been so far mostly used, because\ncircular Rydberg atoms have no optical transitions, hindering their individual\ndetection and manipulation. We remove this limitation with a hybrid platform,\ncombining an array of logical laser-trapped circular Rydberg atoms of rubidium\nwith an auxiliary array of Rb ancilla atoms transiently excited to a low-$\\ell$\nRydberg level. We perform a quantum non-demolition detection of the logical\nqubit with the ancilla, through the blockade of the ancilla optical excitation\ninduced by a F\\\"orster resonance. Conversely, we locally manipulate the logical\nqubit through the excitation of the ancilla. This dual-Rydberg platform is\nhighly promising for quantum computation and simulation. It adds to the\ncircular-atom toolbox the mid-circuit measurements, essential for error\ncorrection.
