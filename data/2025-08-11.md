### [1] [Universal sectors of two-dimensional Carrollian CFTs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05735)

Abstract: We revisit modular invariance in two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field
theories from a geometric perspective. Focusing on the characters of the
induced and highest-weight representations of the theory, we show that there
are regions of parameter space where the vacuum character dominates in the dual
channel. We use this property to zoom into different subsectors of the
Carrollian theory. One of them is reminiscent of the Schwarzian sector of a
relativistic CFT2 and has a flat space holographic interpretation as O-plane
orbifold. It exists only for the highest-weight representation. We prove that
for all sectors with vacuum dominance in the dual channel, the specific heat is
negative, concurrent with the holographic interpretation of the negative
specific heat of asymptotically flat spacetimes with horizons.

### [2] [Learning geometries beyond asymptotic AdS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05808)
*Cheng Ran,Shao-Feng Wu,Zhuo-Yu Xian*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Abstract discusses a holographic bulk reconstruction method using machine learning, specifically designed for non-conformal systems beyond asymptotically AdS spacetimes. The method employs radial flow equations and Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model bulk metrics, trained using boundary Green functions. The approach is tested on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, yielding insights into near-AdS₂ black hole geometries with finite cutoffs, providing a foundation for machine learning applications in holography and understanding real-world non-conformal systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Holographic bulk reconstruction is a key area in high-energy physics, aiming to understand the relationship between boundary field theories and their bulk duals. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning and neural networks, offer promising tools for modeling complex geometries and dynamics in theoretical physics. This paper bridges the gap by applying Neural ODEs to reconstruct bulk metrics from boundary data, addressing the challenge of non-asymptotically AdS spacetimes which are prevalent in real-world systems. This could lead to significant progress in understanding quantum gravity and the holographic principle.

Method: The paper introduces a data-driven approach utilizing radial flow equations derived from holographic Wilsonian renormalization group. A Neural ODE is constructed to model the continuous dynamics of the bulk metric adjustment. The method iteratively adjusts the bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff, using boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window as training data. This approach transforms the problem of bulk reconstruction into a machine learning problem, where the neural network learns the underlying bulk geometry from the boundary data.

Result: The study successfully trains a Neural ODE to reconstruct bulk metrics with various asymptotic behaviors, including AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated geometries. By applying this algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, the researchers identify a critical curve in the parameter space where the learned metric approaches an AdS₂ black hole with finite cutoff. This result provides a concrete example of how machine learning can model the bulk geometry of non-conformal systems, offering a valuable tool for studying real-world quantum field theories with holographic duals.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking method combining holography and machine learning to reconstruct bulk geometries from boundary data. The use of Neural ODEs offers a flexible and powerful tool for modeling complex bulk dynamics, particularly for systems that do not conform to the asymptotically AdS assumption. This approach not only advances our understanding of the holographic principle but also opens new avenues for applying machine learning in the study of real-world non-conformal systems and their bulk duals. The success in the SYK model suggests promising applications for this method in exploring a wide range of quantum field theories and their gravitational duals in the real world.

Abstract: We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that
works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of
boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively
adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green
functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian
renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve
space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE,
which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics.
Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we
demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS,
Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the
algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the
conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled
temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical
curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite
cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from
which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work
provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk
geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.

### [3] [Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05881)
*Partha Nandi Frederik G. Scholtz*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究了低频引力波如何在量子光学力学系统中引起了纯几何相位，提出了一种利用Ramsey干涉仪探测的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探测引力波是一样的探索未知，但传统方法依赖时空应变，这次是用量子相位，可能更直接或更精确。

Method: 用量子光学力学系统和Ramsey干涉仪，将光子数态与镜体运动纠缠，读出引力波相位。

Result: 观察到量子相位变化，说明可以用这种方法探测低频引力波。

Conclusion: 量子相位效应为探测低频引力波提供新方法，丰富量子引力波研究。

Abstract: We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating
from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum
geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent
subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical
or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak
waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive
phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical
description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric
protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become
entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of
the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly
quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering
an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.

### [4] [$AdS_3 \times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude with KK modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06039)
*Hongliang Jiang,De-liang Zhong*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores curvature corrections to a string amplitude involving four KK modes on a specific manifold, using a CFT dual approach, and finds results consistent with strong coupling computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying higher curvature corrections in string theory amplitudes provides insights into quantum gravity effects using holographic dualities.

Method: Utilizes AdS×S Mellin formalism, single-valued multiple polylogarithms, and CFT block expansions to compute the amplitude.

Result: Oresults include operator anomalous dimensions and OPE data matching strong coupling computations.

Conclusion: The work contributes to understanding string theory amplitudes and gravity in AdS via holographic methods.

Abstract: We study the first curvature correction to the string amplitude of four
Kaluza--Klein (KK) modes on $AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M_4$, with $M_4=K3$ or
$T^4$, in type IIB string theory, which is holographically dual to the
four--point correlator $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p_1} \mathcal{O}_{p_2}
\mathcal{O}_{p_3} \mathcal{O}_{p_4} \rangle$ of certain half--BPS operators in
the boundary D1--D5 CFT. The result takes the form of an integral over the
Riemann sphere, analogous to the flat-space Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude, but
with insertions of single-valued multiple polylogarithms of weight three. Our
results are obtained in two steps. First, we derive the $AdS_3 \times S^3$
Virasoro--Shapiro amplitude in the special case $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p}
\mathcal{O}_{p} \mathcal{O}_{1} \mathcal{O}_{1} \rangle$, by matching the CFT
block expansion with an ansatz based on single-valued multiple polylogarithms.
We then employ the $AdS \times S$ Mellin formalism to generalize the result to
the general case of four arbitrary KK modes $\langle \mathcal{O}_{p_1}
\mathcal{O}_{p_2} \mathcal{O}_{p_3} \mathcal{O}_{p_4} \rangle$. Our analysis
yields an infinite set of results for operator anomalous dimensions and OPE
data in D1--D5 CFT at strong coupling. In particular, the resulting scaling
dimensions of certain operators are shown to be consistent with classical
string theory computations.

TL;DR: 摘要中提出了用于描述AdS_6连续自旋场的so(2,5)代数表示，使用了Lie-Lorentz导数来实现有关AdS_6几何和自旋自由度，导出了Casimir算子的具体表达式，基于一个约束系统，这些约束可以推广到六维Minkowski空间。结果显示，这些约束完全确定了so(2,5)代数的所有Casimir算子，它们的特征值由一个维度实参数μ和一个正半整数s确定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维AdS空间中的自旋场一直是理论物理中的一个重要方向，连续自旋场在量子重力和高能理论中有着潜在的应用，因此深入理解其代数结构及其Casimir算子是关键。

Method: 文章构建了so(2,5)代数在AdS_6中的表示，并利用Lie-Lorentz导数结合自旋自由度，导出了Casimir算子的显式表达式。通过一个推广六维Minkowski空间约束系统的方法，推导了相关算子，展示了约束如何完全确定Casimir算子特性，最后给出了参数的影响。

Result: 主要结果是基于构建的表示，得出了Casimir算子的具体形式，并通过约束系统确定了由μ和s参数决定的特征值，充分研究了AdS_6空间中连续自旋场的代数结构。

Conclusion: 文章构建了so(2,5)代数在AdS_6中表示，结合了Lie-Lorentz导数和自旋自由度，得出了Casimir算子的具体表达式，并展示了如何用μ和s确定其特征值，为连续自旋场的理论研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: A representation of the $\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra corresponding to the
continuous spin field in $\mathbf{AdS_6}$ is considered. The algebra is
realized using the Lie-Lorentz derivative, which naturally incorporates
$\mathbf{AdS_6}$ geometry and spin degrees of freedom. Within this framework,
we derive explicit expressions for the Casimir operators in terms of both the
covariant derivative and the spin invariants. The continuous spin
representation under consideration is defined by a system of operator
constraints that generalize those known for six-dimensional Minkowski space. We
demonstrate that these constraints completely fix all Casimir operators of the
$\mathfrak{so}(2,5)$ algebra, with the eigenvalues determined by a dimensional
real parameter $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and a positive (half-)integer $s$.

*Yu. M. Zinoviev*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究论文继续探讨了高自旋引力相互作用，扩展了关于自旋5/2和自旋3的研究。使用了规范不变的框架式方法来构建相互作用，发现当m²=6Λ时，非极小相互作用成为唯一的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者可能希望探索更高自旋对象的引力相互作用并找到在这个特定质量和引力常数条件下唯一的相互作用形式。

Method: 采用了规范不变的框架式方法来构造相互作用，可能与之前在自旋5/2的研究中使用的方法类似。

Result: 当m²=6Λ时，非极小相互作用成为唯一的选择。

Conclusion: 在dS4中，当m²=6Λ时，非极小相互作用成为唯一的选择。

Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of gravitational interactions
for massive higher spins, extending our recent work on massive spin 5/2 to
massive spin 3, including its massless and partially massless limits. To
construct the minimal gravitational interactions (i.e. vertexes containing both
standard minimal interactions and non-minimal ones, which are necessary for any
$s \ge 5/2$), we use a gauge invariant frame-like formalism. Similarly to the
spin 5/2 case, there is a special point $m^2 = 6\Lambda$, which corresponds to
a boundary of the unitary allowed region in $dS_4$, where minimal interactions
disappear, leaving only the non-minimal ones.

*Syo Kamata*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过引入PT对称势和Hermitian势，结合T-系统和ODE/IM对应，提出了精确求和法则和ζ生成函数，揭示了谱ζ函数之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者试图通过数学工具和对称势理论解释量子力学中的谱特性，特别是在非厄米系统中的潜在代数结构。

Method: 运用T-系统和ODE/IM对应理论，通过分析 fusion relations和Chebyshev多项式，导出了精确求和法则和ζ生成函数。

Result: 成功导出了PT势和Hermitian势的精确求和法则和ζ生成函数，揭示了谱ζ函数之间固定n下的代数关系以及不同n之间的映射关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为PT对称和Hermitian量子力学提供新的谱解释，发现了潜在的代数结构，推动了相关领域的理论发展。

Abstract: We formulate exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for
quantum mechanics defined by the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{\cal
PT}(x) = x^{2K} (ix)^\varepsilon$ with $K,\varepsilon \in \mathbb{N}$, as well
as the Hermitian potential $V_{\cal H}(x) = x^{2 K}$ with $K \in {\mathbb N} +
1$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system in the framework
of the ODE/IM correspondence. In this setup, the fusion relations on the
integrable model (IM) side correspond to recurrence relations among
quantization conditions on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) side, which
we reformulate in terms of spectral zeta functions (SZFs), $\zeta_n(s) =
\sum_{\alpha \in {\mathbb N}_0} E_{n,\alpha}^{-s}$, where $n$ denotes the
fusion label. The ESRs yield algebraic relations among SZFs at fixed $n$, while
the ZGFs establish explicit functional mappings between SZFs at different
fusion labels. These structures are governed by a selection rule depending on
both $M$ and $n$, induced in general by the combination of the structure of the
Chebyshev polynomials appearing in the fusion relations and the
$\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik rotational symmetry. Our results provide a novel
spectral interpretation of the T-system in integrable models and point toward
hidden algebraic structures governing global spectral data in
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian quantum mechanics.

### [8] [Geometry of supergravity and the Batalin--Vilkovisky formulation of the $\mathcal N=1$ theory in ten dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06398)
*Julian Kupka,Charles Strickland-Constable,Fridrich Valach*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a detailed Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation for N=1 supergravity in ten dimensions, incorporating all fermionic orders without relying on standard metrics or local Lorentz symmetries. It emphasizes the fibred structure of the field space and uses this to explain variations of spinor quantities and the metric, including additional terms in commutators and a demonstration that the action satisfies the classical master equation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses fermionic formulations of supergravity without local frames, which is a niche but important area, especially for understanding higher-order fermionic fields and the BV formalism.

Method: The approach involves using generalised geometry, fibred structures, and BV formalism, avoiding traditional frames. The field space fibering is key, allowing for supersymmetry algebra calculations with additional terms.

Result: The authors successfully construct an BV action with all fermionic orders and demonstrate it satisfies the classical master equation, using a fibred structure without orthonormal frames.

Conclusion: This BV framework for N=1 supergravity in ten dimensions offers a novel approach without relying on frames, providing a clearer understanding of supersymmetry algebra modifications and higher-order fermionic effects, paving the way for future applications in quantizing supergravity.

Abstract: We provide full details of a BV formulation of $\mathcal N=1$ supergravity in
ten dimensions, to all orders in fermions, built from the generalised geometry
description of the theory. In contrast to standard treatments, we introduce
neither the degrees of freedom corresponding to orthonormal frames for the
metric nor the local Lorentz symmetries that remove them again. Instead, we
observe that the field space has a fibred structure, with the fermionic degrees
of freedom spanning the fibres. We explain in detail how this geometric picture
allows one to understand simultaneous variations of spinorial quantities and
the metric with respect to which the spinor bundles are defined. This leads to
additional terms in certain commutators on field space which account for the
Lorentz transformation terms appearing in the calculation of the supersymmetry
algebra. Unencumbered by the Lorentz degrees of freedom, we provide an
efficient and full demonstration that our action satisfies the classical master
equation.

Result: 结果提出了一种适用于计算协变非极小算符热核的系统化方法，该方法可以系统地展开并利用时空曲率等参数计算。这种方法的实现依赖于复杂的数学工具，特别是伪微分算子和世界函数的特性。

Conclusion: 要计算这类问题，可以使用文中提出的方法；这种方法相较于其他可用的热核计算方法，可能提升了计算效率和准确性，为理论物理研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant
nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null
with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a
pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear
operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal
one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime
curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with
the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its
derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time
integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important
part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples
of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate
principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of
nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their
operator symbols.

Conclusion: Bardeen 背景为空间量子标量场提供了研究渐近安全性和量子引力稳定性的新平台。需要更详细的实验数据验证结果。

Abstract: We compute the renormalized stress-energy tensor for a massless quantum
scalar field in the background of the horizonless Bardeen spacetime. Within the
weak-field approximation, we show that the vacuum fluctuations differ
significantly between conformally and non-conformally coupled fields, both in
magnitude and in their behavior at short and intermediate distances. At large
distances, we recover the universal asymptotic behavior previously observed in
black hole and Newtonian star backgrounds. Going beyond the weak-field regime,
we find that, for certain parameter ranges, the modes of the field can develop
imaginary frequencies, leading to instabilities and an exponential growth of
vacuum fluctuations. We also discuss critically the applicability of the
anomaly-induced effective action for computing the renormalized stress-energy
tensor in the conformally coupled case.

Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators offer a promising approach to the exploration
of strongly interacting many-body systems, with applications spanning condensed
matter, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. Through a combination
of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we
demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by
studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map
out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of
density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and
experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we
discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe
its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium
quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from
kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by
neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum
matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization
dynamics in many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: The Higgs mode is a key component in the spontaneous breaking of a continuous
symmetry along with the Nambu-Goldstone mode, and has been studied extensively
for homogeneous systems. We consider it for inhomogeneous systems, using the
superfluid of harmonically trapped ultracold Fermi atomic gas. The Fermionic
field operators are expanded in a complete set of wave functions corresponding
to inhomogeneous situation. Within the Hatree-Fock approximation, we derive
integral equations from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which lead to the
frequencies of the collective modes, including the Higgs and Nambu-Goldstone
modes. The results show that the frequency of the Higgs mode equals twice the
absolute value of the order parameter at the center of trap. This feature is
robust against variations in the interaction strength, trap potential, and
temperature. These results are consistent with previous theoretical and
experimental studies.

Abstract: We study interaction-induced bound states in a system of ultracold bosons
loaded into the states with orbital angular momentum in a one-dimensional
staggered lattice of rings. We consider the hard-core limit and strong
nearest-neighbour interactions such that two particles in next neighbouring
sites are bound. Focusing on the manifold of such bound states, we have derived
the corresponding effective model for doublons. With orbital angular momentum
$l=1$, the original physical system is described as a Creutz ladder by using
the circulations as a synthetic dimension, and the effective model obtained
consists of two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and two Bose-Hubbard chains.
Therefore, the system can exhibit topologically protected edge states. In a
structure that alternates $l=1$ and $l=0$ states, the original system can be
mapped to a diamond chain. In this case, the effective doublon model
corresponds to a Creutz ladder with extra vertical hoppings between legs and
can be mapped to two SSH chains if all the couplings in the original system are
equal. Tuning spatially the amplitude of the couplings destroys the inversion
symmetry of these SSH chains, but enables the appearance of multiple flat
bands.

Abstract: We spectroscopically study mobile impurities immersed in a homogeneous
bosonic bath (a box-trapped Bose gas), varying the bath temperature and the
strength of impurity-bath interactions. We compare our results to those for a
quasipure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and find that for strong
impurity-bath interactions, the spectra narrow with increasing temperature,
while the impurity energy shift is suppressed. Near the critical temperature
for condensation, many-body effects still play an important role, and only for
a nondegenerate bath, the system approaches the classical Boltzmann-gas
behavior. The key spectral features are reproduced within the theory of an
ideal Bose polaron.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of non-zero magnetization on the ground-state
phase diagram of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Employing a mean-field
theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that
positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization
dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott
insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to
the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid
in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings
highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization
here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability
and emergence of distinct quantum phases.

Abstract: Isomerization, i.e. the rearrangement between distinct molecular
configurations, is a fundamental process in chemistry. Here we demonstrate that
two-dimensional Coulomb crystals can emulate molecular isomerization and be
used to characterize its physical mechanisms. In our molecular analogue, the
confining potential acts as an electronic orbital, which can be tuned
continuously and dynamically. We use a planar crystal of six 138Ba+ ions, which
exhibits two stable configurations depending on the aspect ratio of the
harmonic trapping potential. By changing this aspect ratio, we directly modify
the potential energy surface (PES) of the ion crystal, and trigger
isomerization in a controlled way. We identify a region of bistability between
the two isomers, and use configuration-resolved imaging to detect isomerization
in real time. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate the double well
PES. By comparing simulated transition rates with experimental population
ratios, we estimate the crystal's temperature. Additionally, we prepare
metastable configurations by rapidly quenching the PES, and detect
isomerization dynamics with sub-millisecond resolution. Our work establishes a
new platform for emulating molecular processes, paving the way for studying
quantum superpositions of crystal configurations, and for controlling isomeric
excitations in two-dimensional Coulomb crystals.

Abstract: In the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, the spin
connection and coframe variables are incorporated into a single Lie
algebra-valued connection called the MacDowell-Mansouri connection, $\omega$.
From the curvature form $F$ of $\omega$ and an auxiliary field, $B$, one may
formulate general relativity as a deformed topological field theory by
constructing an action functional whose variation yields a set of field
equations that are equivalent to the Einstein equations on shell. In this
article, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the
MacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a
cosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of
the resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on
shell. Through the lens of Cartan geometry, we then discuss a notable
geometrical difference between general relativity and its conformally
transformed counterpart. Specifically, for the latter, we show that points in
spacetime are infinitesimally approximated by homogeneous spaces (restricted to
a point) whose radii are parameterised by the value of the cosmological scalar
field.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive
collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired,
five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification,
obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are
treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is
encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic
and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim
\Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 =
\frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied,
the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large
$R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative
approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to
determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically
supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as
gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the
study of stopping power and particle range.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了弱引力模型的应用，提供了新的分析框架，这对理解宇宙加速膨胀和暗物质与暗能量问题具有启示。

Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing
on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This
letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity
theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling
stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the
inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently
released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis
functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the
stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on
models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at
late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a
dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We
find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also
include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$,
and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force.
Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI
$w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for propagating gravitational waves to null infinity using numerical relativity data in timelike worldtubes. Their method involves using hyperboloidal coordinates in a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation, allowing for efficient and high-quality gravitational wave extraction. Various applications like neutron star and black hole mergers are showcased, and it's noted as a step towards more advanced hyperboloidal schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detection and astrophysics rely on accurate extraction methods, which is a key area of focus in modern physics. This paper aims to enhance the process by using numerical relativity data effectively.

Method: The approach combines numerical relativity data with a perturbative Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli method in hyperboloidal coordinates to create an efficient extraction process. Data from timelike worldtubes is used as input to this simulation, which then extends gravitational waves to null infinity.

Result: The method provides accurate waveforms compared to other extraction techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness for applications like binary black hole mergers and neutron star mergers.

Conclusion: This framework offers an efficient and effective method for gravitational wave extraction, paving the way for more precise simulations and better understanding of gravitational phenomena. It serves as a significant advancement in the field of gravitational wave physics and astrophysics research.

Abstract: We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves
computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical
relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as
the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null
infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational
collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering,
and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation
methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet
efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable
to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications.
Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but
the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal
schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.

Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our
current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly
assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much
larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the
superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems
whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very
promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this
work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant
formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account
for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings
with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the
(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when
attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in
terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When
this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even
with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We
then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of
quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)
charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our
clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix
$\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields
not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical
expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum
fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.

Motivation: The paper seems to be addressing a fundamental question in general relativity and gauge theories: under what conditions are these specific solutions unique, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of spacetime in such theories.

Method: Methods include conformal geometry and energy theorems, suggesting a blend of differential geometry and energy conditions in their analysis.

Result: The researchers have shown that the uniqueness of these solutions is determined by their asymptotic data, relying on the conformal positive energy theorem.

Conclusion: Therefore, this paper provides a foundational understanding of the uniqueness of these solutions, contributing to the broader theory of higher-dimensional gravity and gauge fields.

Abstract: In our paper we pay attention to the problem of uniqueness (classification)
of higher-dimensional electro-magnetic static, asymptotically flat,

gravity theory, which possess a photon sphere. The photon sphere is uniquely
described by its asymptotic data. Conformal positive energy theorem is the key

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: IR/UV mixing is a quantum-gravity effect appearing in several theories, and this paper explores its implications in cold-atom interferometry. They establish bounds on the characteristic length scale and solve a discrepancy between Cesium and Rubidium measurements. The results reach the Planck length, showing potential implications for quantum gravity experiments with cold atoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is of interest to researchers studying quantum gravity effects using cold atoms. The potential connection between low-energy quantum gravity and high-energy phenomena, as referenced by IR/UV mixing, makes the study relevant to understanding quantum gravity mechanisms in a lab setting.

Method: The authors use cold-atom interferometry measurements to infer constraints on the IR/UV mixing parameter. They analyze both positive and negative corrections to the dispersion relation, leading to bounds on the characteristic scale where these effects become significant. The observational data from Cesium and Rubidium atoms are used to pinpoint regions of parameter space where quantum gravity effects can be observed, addressing a known discrepancy between these two isotopes.

Result: The study reveals that IR/UV mixing could resolve the discrepancy between Cesium and Rubidium-based measurements of the fine structure constant. The derived bounds on the characteristic length scale reach the Planck length, suggesting that low-energy quantum gravity effects, if present, could manifest in cold atom experiments near this scale.

Conclusion: This work provides a bridge between cold-atom quantum metrology and quantum gravity phenomenology, demonstrating that IR/UV mixing could offer a solution to the observed discrepancy in precision measurements using different atomic isotopes, and opens new avenues for testing quantum gravity effects experimentally by setting clear observational signatures.

Abstract: IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to
manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature
found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the
implications for "soft" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation
that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry
measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish
bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length
milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half
the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling
discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric
measurements of the fine structure constant.

*Kratika Mazde,Lisa Mickel,Patrick Peter*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores a quantum cosmology approach where the background state remains non-classical and the perturbations yield varying power spectra compared to classical scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation centers on challenging traditional quantum cosmology methods, which often assume a single classical state. By allowing multiple quantum trajectories, the research seeks to assess the impact of non-classical backgrounds on early universe perturbations and potentially infer observable differences in the cosmic microwave background.

Method: The authors utilize the eikonal approximation to define quantum trajectories, enabling the study of varying background states while maintaining the Born-Oppenheimer factorization. This method allows for a comparison between non-classical and classical scenarios.

Result: Through this approach, the study reveals that non-classical backgrounds can lead to distinct power spectrum predictions for perturbations, with the power spectrum varying significantly depending on the quantum trajectory followed.

Conclusion: The research concludes that extending the quantum cosmology framework to non-classical trajectories has the potential to influence our understanding of the early universe's perturbations, offering new insights into the quantum origins of structure formation.

Abstract: Predictions from early universe cosmology typically concern primordial
perturbations generated during epochs where effects arising from the quantum
nature of gravity may be important; quantum vacuum fluctuations being stretched
to cosmological scales during a phase of inflation. Quantizing the background
is then done by assuming a single close-to-classical state over which
perturbations grow, as well as a Born-Oppenheimer factorization throughout the
relevant phase. We present a scenario in which although the latter
factorization remains valid at all times, we allow the background state to be
very non-classical by defining quantum trajectories through an eikonal
approximation. We find that these trajectories asymptotically reproduce an
almost classical behavior for the background, but the predictions for the power
spectrum of perturbations can significantly differ.

Abstract: Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure
Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the
underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work,
we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in
the ambit of perturbed Kepler problem, and explore their impact on eccentric
orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional
parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions,
our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more
natural to trace the physical origins of various model parameters. Starting
from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute
the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their
observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework
thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit to probe such subtle
effects in gravitational wave data.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically
symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity
augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term.
By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function
including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously
integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel
field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible
torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate
both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed
via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition
$b'(r_0)<1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null
and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only
controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel
massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for
asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an
explicit cosmological constant.

Result: 多原子阴离子（H2PO4⁻和PO4³⁻）通过协同作用（包括氢键和疏水作用）显著增强VLP的稳定性，而单原子阴离子（Cl⁻和F⁻）效果较差，需增加NaCl浓度以补偿。

Conclusion: 该研究帮助解释了离子在VLP组装中的关键作用，为设计稳定的病毒样结构提供了指导。

Abstract: Synthetic virus-like particles (VLP), designed from simplified building
blocks, can reduce the complexity of native viral proteins and be tailored for
specific applications. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the
role of counterions (H2PO4-, PO43-, Cl-, and F-) in stabilizing a pre-assembled
virus-like shell formed by cationic peptides exemplified by synthetic
cyclopeptide (sequence: cyc-Gln-DLeu-Arg-DLeu-Arg-DLeu-Arg-DLeu) VLP shells.
Our findings reveal that polyatomic anions (H2PO4- and PO43-) facilitate stable
assemblies by condensing on the VLP shell to higher degrees, thereby
neutralizing Coulombic repulsion among the peptide building blocks. Cohesion is
largely promoted through the multidentate hydrogen bonds with arginine:
Substituting arginine by lysine in the system with H2PO4- leads to
destabilization of the structure. H2PO4- additionally engages in hydrophobic
interactions with leucine side chains. By contrast, monoatomic anions (Cl- and
F-) show insufficient coordination to the peptides and fail to stabilize the
assembly, while supplementing F- with excess 1M NaCl can recover the structural
integrity by screening electrostatic interactions. This study provides
important insights into the role of counterions in molecular self-assembly and
the nature of their interactions with amino-acid side chains involved in the
cooperative formation and stabilization of synthetic virus-like shells.

Conclusion: 研究展示了机器学习势能面在计算H/D转移中的应用，验证了计算方法和势能面的质量，未来加倍计算获得更高精度。

Abstract: The infrared spectroscopy and proton transfer dynamics together with the
associated tunneling splittings for H/D-transfer in oxalate are investigated
using a machine learning-based potential energy surface (PES) of CCSD(T)
quality, calibrated against the results of new spectroscopic measurements.
Second order vibrational perturbation calculations (VPT2) very successfully
describe both the framework and H-transfer modes compared with the experiments.
In particular, a new low-intensity signature at 1666 cm$^{-1}$ was correctly
predicted from the VPT2 calculations. An unstructured band centered at 2940
cm$^{-1}$ superimposed on a broad background extending from 2600 to 3200
cm$^{-1}$ is assigned to the H-transfer motion. The broad background involves a
multitude of combination bands but a major role is played by the COH-bend. For
the deuterated species, VPT2 and molecular dynamics simulations provide equally
convincing assignments, in particular for the framework modes. Finally, based
on the new PES the tunneling splitting for H-transfer is predicted as
$\Delta_{\rm H} = 35.0$ cm$^{-1}$ from ring polymer instanton calculations
using higher-order corrections. This provides an experimentally accessible
benchmark to validate the computations, in particular the quality of the
machine-learned PES.

Conclusion: 纳米颗粒的光散射数据可以用均匀模型解释，说明系统的广延性质和ergodicity现象。

Abstract: Static Light Scattering (SLS) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) are very
important techniques to study the characteristics of nano-particles in
dispersion. The data of SLS is determined by the optical characteristic and the
measured values of DLS are determined by optical and hydrodynamic
characteristics of different size nano-particles in dispersion. In general, the
nano-particles investigated are considered to be cross-linked soft particles or
hyper-branched chains with a three dimensional network structure. Therefore the
density of these nano-particles is not homogeneous and the different parts have
different optical characteristics. However our experiments reveal that the long
time average data of scattered intensity can be perfectly described by
homogeneous spherical model. Based on the size distribution obtained using the
SLS or TEM technique and the relation between the static and hydrodynamic
radii, all the calculated and measured values of $g^{\left( 2\right) }\left(
\tau \right) $ investigated are also consistent perfectly. Since the long time
average scattered intensity of non-homogeneous spherical nano-particles can be
perfectly described by homogeneous spherical model, so the phenomenons of
ergodicity happen in our experiments.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how modifying the kick sequence in the atom-optics kicked rotor enhances quantum localization through a combination of controlled diffusion and standard kicks, with results that match simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum control strategies in kicked rotor systems are important for quantum computing and precision measurements, thus providing a method to achieve desired quantum states is motivations.

Method: Implementation of modified kick sequences by halving the Talbot time post every M kicks, followed by analysis of the resulting wavefunction profiles.

Result: Experiments show dependence on M, with enhanced diffusion followed by localization. Wavefunctions are localized but non-exponential.

Conclusion: This method provides a new route for quantum control, combining diffusion and localization mechanisms to achieve specific quantum states with tunable parameters.

Abstract: Atom-optics kicked rotor represents an experimentally realizable version of
the paradigmatic quantum kicked rotor system. After a short initial diffusive
phase the cloud settles down to a stationary state due to the onset of
dynamical localization. In this work we realise an enhancement of localization
by modification of the kick sequence. We experimentally implement the
modification to this system in which the sign of the kick sequence is flipped
by allowing for a free evolution of the wavepackets for half the Talbot time
after every $M$ kicks. Depending on the value of $M$, this modified system
displays a combination of enhanced diffusion followed by asymptotic
localization. This is explained as resulting from two competing processes --
localization induced by standard kicked rotor type kicks, and diffusion induced
by half Talbot time evolution. The evolving states display a localized but
non-exponential wave function profiles. This provides another route to quantum
control in kicked rotor class of systems. The numerical simulations agree well
with the experimental results.

Abstract: Quantum computers represent a radical technological breakthrough in
information processing by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to
solve highly complex problems beyond the reach of classical systems. However,
in the current NISQ era (noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices), the
available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number of
qubits, high error rates, and short coherence times. Efficient management of
quantum resources, both physical and logical, is especially relevant in the
design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the role
of resources in current uses of NISQ devices, identifying their relevance and
implications for quantum software engineering. With this contribution, we aim
to strengthen the field of Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move toward
scalable and reliable quantum software development

Abstract: In the usual quantum tunneling, a low-energy quantum particle penetrates
across a physical barrier of higher potential energy, by traversing a
classically forbidden region, and finally escapes into another region. In an
analogous scenario, a classical particle inside a closed regular region in the
phase space is dynamically bound from escaping to other regions of the phase
space. Here, the physical potential barrier is replaced by dynamical barriers
which separate different regions of the phase space. However, in the quantum
regime, the system can overcome such dynamical barriers and escape through
them, giving rise to dynamical tunneling. In chaotic Hamiltonian systems,
dynamical tunneling refers to quantum tunneling between states whose classical
limit correspond to symmetry-related regular regions separated by a chaotic
zone between which any classical transport is prohibited. Here, an experimental
realization of dynamical tunneling in spin systems is reported using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) architecture. In particular, dynamical tunneling in
quantum kicked tops of spin-1 and spin-3/2 systems using two- and three-qubit
NMR registers is investigated. By extracting time-dependent expectation values
of the angular momentum operator components, size-dependent tunneling behaviour
for various initial states is systematically investigated. Further, by
monitoring the adverse effects of dephasing noise on the tunneling
oscillations, we assert the importance of quantum coherence in enabling
dynamical tunneling.

providing a rigorous justification for the end-to-end efficiency of system-bath
interaction models in thermal and ground state preparation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the dynamics of a two-body linear kicked rotor, showing that interactions can induce chaos and chaos-induced localization in both classical and quantum regimes, with various phases observed including diffusive and localized states. The entanglement growth is analyzed using Hilbert space dimensions and random matrix theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore how interactions in integrable systems can lead to non-intuitive behaviors like chaos and localization, expanding our understanding of complex dynamics.

Method: The study uses an analytical approach for the classical system and quantum simulations for analyzing phases like localization and entanglement.

Result: Classical and quantum systems show chaos and localization through interactions, with measurable signatures through Lyapunov exponents and entanglement entropy.

Conclusion: This work bridges integrable systems with chaos and localization, offering insights into quantum-classical correspondence in interacting models.

Abstract: Despite the periodic kicks, a linear kicked rotor (LKR) is an integrable and
exactly solvable model in which the kinetic energy term is linear in momentum.
It was recently shown that spatially interacting LKRs are also integrable, and
results in dynamical localization in the corresponding quantum regime. Similar
localized phases exist in other non-integrable models such as the coupled
relativistic kicked rotors. This work, using a two-body LKR, demonstrates two
main results; firstly, it is shown that chaos can be induced in the integrable
linear kicked rotor through interactions between the momenta of rotors. An
analytical estimate of its Lyapunov exponent is obtained. Secondly, the quantum
dynamics of this chaotic model, upon variation of kicking and interaction
strengths, is shown to exhibit a variety of phases -- classically induced
localization, dynamical localization, subdiffusive and diffusive phases. We
point out the signatures of these phases from the perspective of entanglement
production in this system. By defining an effective Hilbert space dimension,
the entanglement growth rate can be understood using appropriate random matrix
averages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackle challenges in decision-making processes, aiming to enhance efficiency for real-world applications like robotics and ai game theory.

Method: The authors developed quantum Value Iteration (QVI) algorithms in two settings, exact dynamics and generative models, achieving speedups and improved complexities.

Result: The QVI algorithms in both settings provide quadratic speedups and better sample/query complexities than classical counterparts, with optimal complexities in quantum lower bounds.

Conclusion: The study positions quantum computing as a powerful tool for optimal decision-making in finite-horizon MDPs, with practical implications for various AI applications.

Abstract: In this work, we design quantum algorithms that are more efficient than
classical algorithms to solve time-dependent and finite-horizon Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) in two distinct settings: (1) In the exact dynamics setting,
where the agent has full knowledge of the environment's dynamics (i.e.,
transition probabilities), we prove that our $\textbf{Quantum Value Iteration
(QVI)}$ algorithm $\textbf{QVI-1}$ achieves a quadratic speedup in the size of
the action space $(A)$ compared with the classical value iteration algorithm
for computing the optimal policy ($\pi^{*}$) and the optimal V-value function
($V_{0}^{*}$). Furthermore, our algorithm $\textbf{QVI-2}$ provides an
additional speedup in the size of the state space $(S)$ when obtaining
near-optimal policies and V-value functions. Both $\textbf{QVI-1}$ and
$\textbf{QVI-2}$ achieve quantum query complexities that provably improve upon
classical lower bounds, particularly in their dependences on $S$ and $A$. (2)
In the generative model setting, where samples from the environment are
accessible in quantum superposition, we prove that our algorithms
$\textbf{QVI-3}$ and $\textbf{QVI-4}$ achieve improvements in sample complexity
over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical algorithm in terms of $A$,
estimation error $(\epsilon)$, and time horizon $(H)$. More importantly, we
prove quantum lower bounds to show that $\textbf{QVI-3}$ and $\textbf{QVI-4}$
are asymptotically optimal, up to logarithmic factors, assuming a constant time
horizon.

Conclusion: 这些结果为实验设计提供了指导，帮助避免重复动力学现象，适用于研究量子 chaos和相干性。

Abstract: A host of dynamical measures of quantum correlations -- out-of-time ordered
correlators (OTOC), Loschmidt echo, generalized entanglement and observational
entropy -- are useful to infer the underlying classical chaotic dynamics in
quantum regime. In this work, these measures are employed to analyse quantum
kicked top with kick strength $k$. It is shown that, despite the differences in
their definitions, these measures are periodic with $k$, and the periodicity
depends on the number of spins represented by the kicked top. The periodic
behaviour arises from the structure of the kicked top Floquet operator and
spans the regime in which the corresponding classical dynamics is predominantly
chaotic. We also point to the reflection symmetry in Loschmidt echo and a
special case of time periodicity in OTOC. This result can guide experiments
towards the right choice of kick strengths to avoid repetitive dynamics.

Result: The classical solver performed well, indicating that quantum advantage may be harder to achieve than initially hoped.

Conclusion: Without more research, quantum computers may not provide practical quantum advantage for NMR simulations soon.

Abstract: The simulation of the spectra measured in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy experiments is a computationally non-trivial problem, and as such,
it represents a problem for which a quantum computer may provide some practical
advantage over traditional computing methods. In order to understand the extent
to which such problems may provide examples of useful quantum advantage, it is
important to understand the limitations of existing classical simulation
methods. In this work, we benchmark our classical solver designed to solve such

Abstract: The quantum kicked rotor (QKR) is a fundamental model of time-dependent
quantum chaos and the physics of Anderson localization. It is one of the most
well-studied Floquet systems. In this work, it is shown that QKR can be used to
implement a quantum algorithm to perform unstructured search; namely Amplitude
Amplification, a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. Further, the QKR
is employed for amplitude estimation when the amplitude of the marked states is
unknown. It is also shown that the characteristic property of dynamical
localization of the QKR can be exploited to enhance the performance of the
amplitude amplification algorithm by reducing its average runtime. The
sensitivity of the success probability of unstructured search to detuning from
resonance and the effects of noisy kick strengths are analyzed and the
robustness of the QKR based algorithm is demonstrated. The experimental
feasibility of every component of the algorithm is discussed.

Motivation: The paper addresses the crucial challenge of distinguishing real quantum advantages from illusions, leveraging mathematical properties to advance quantum technology.

Result: The study reveals that some quantum advantages are unpredictable using classical methods alone, indicating a potential for future quantum advancements.

Conclusion: The paper emphasizes the importance of mathematical rigor and suggests that future quantum technologies may rely on advantageous capabilities yet to be fully understood or conceptualized.

Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum
technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from
exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision,
distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable
challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to
foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded
fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical
tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation,
learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties:
predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that
define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages
could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some
quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources
alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee.
While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of
quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.

Conclusion: 量子混沌用于辅助电池具有潜力提升工作提取效率。

Abstract: The maximum unitarily extractable work from a quantum system -- ergotropy --
is the basic principle behind quantum batteries, a rapidly emerging field. This
work studies ergotropy in two quantum chaotic systems, the quantum kicked top
and the kicked Ising spin chain, to illustrate the effects of chaotic dynamics.
In an ancilla-assisted scenario, chaos enhances ergotropy when the state is
known, a consequence of large entanglement production in the chaotic regime.
When the state is unknown, we need to at least partially characterize the state
using coarse-grained measurements for useful extraction of work. In this case,
chaos impedes ergotropy by suppressing information gained from coarse-grained
measurements, while entanglement with an ancilla still facilitates ergotropy.
In this scenario, we study the interplay between chaos and entanglement and
find a sweet spot in the chaos parameter for optimal work. Our results point to
the potential of quantum chaos-assisted batteries for better work extraction.

Motivation: Understanding the conditions for genuine 2+1D physics is crucial for validating quantum simulators and advancing quantum field theory studies.

Method: They use tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, focusing on the plaquette term and string dynamics in different scenarios.

Result: The plaquette term is essential for genuine 2+1D string dynamics, whereas without it, processes resemble 1+1D dynamics regardless of lattice structure.

Conclusion: The findings provide a clear criterion for genuine 2+1D behavior in 2+1D LGTs and guide future quantum simulation experiments.

Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories
(LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed
physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address
this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics
in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network
simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which
represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d>1$ spatial dimensions, plays
a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined
regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we
demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial
dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process
independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of
what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear
guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for performing DMFT calculations on near-term quantum computers. It addresses the challenge of calculating impurity Green's functions efficiently by combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed quantum circuit. The approach is validated in a noise-free setting and demonstrated on IBM quantum devices for a specific system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the challenge of materials science and quantum computing by improving the accuracy and efficiency of DMFT calculations, which are crucial for understanding complex electron systems in condensed matter physics and chemistry.

Method: The method involves using a low-rank Gaussian subspace to represent the ground state and a compressed quantum circuit optimized for calculating impurity Green's functions, incorporating techniques like Gaussian state preparation and time evolution. The combination allows for efficient computation on near-term quantum hardware.

Result: Numerical simulations show convergence of the DMFT algorithm with the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free environment. The IBM quantum processor implementation for a specific system with an impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 qubits and 1 ancilla) is successful, indicating the feasibility of the approach on existing quantum hardware.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising path towards implementing DMFT-based calculations on quantum computers, enhancing the potential of quantum devices in advancing materials science and correlated electron systems research.

Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated
electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter
physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for
quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach
that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated
behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for
the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on
quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the
structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace
representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum
circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to
compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the
DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show
the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity
Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to
three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential
paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials
science.

Abstract: Classical simulations of noisy quantum circuits is instrumental to our
understanding of the behavior of real world quantum systems and the
identification of regimes where one expects quantum advantage. In this work, we
present a highly parallelizable tensor-network-based classical algorithm --
equipped with rigorous accuracy guarantees -- for simulating $n$-qubit quantum
circuits with arbitrary single-qubit noise. Our algorithm represents the state
of a noisy quantum system by a particular ensemble of matrix product states
from which we stochastically sample. Each single qubit noise process acting on
a pure state is then represented by the ensemble of states that achieve the
minimal average entanglement (the entanglement of formation) between the noisy
qubit and the remainder. This approach lets us use a more compact
representation of the quantum state for a given accuracy requirement and noise
level. For a given maximum bond dimension $\chi$ and circuit, our algorithm
comes with an upper bound on the simulation error, runs in poly$(n,\chi)$-time
and improves upon related prior work (1) in scope: by extending from the three
commonly considered noise models to general single qubit noise (2) in
performance: by employing a state-dependent locally-entanglement-optimal
unraveling and (3) in conceptual contribution: by showing that the fixed
unraveling used in prior work becomes equivalent to our choice of unraveling in
the special case of depolarizing and dephasing noise acting on a maximally
entangled state.

Abstract: Quantum dots in micropillars are one of the most promising options for a
bright, deterministic single photon source. While highly efficient devices
(>95%) have been designed, there remains a significant bottleneck that impacts
the overall system efficiency: the large numerical aperture of the output mode.
This leads to inefficient coupling of emitted photons into single-mode fibre,
thus limiting practical integration into quantum computing and communication
architectures. We show that with the addition of a well designed aspheric SiO2
microlens we can decrease the mode-matching losses to a SMF from 83.1% to
<0.1(0.1)%. This can result in a single photon source design with 96.4(0.1)%

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have emerged as a promising tool to solve combinatorial
optimization problems. The quantum walk optimization algorithm (QWOA) is one
such variational approach that has recently gained attention. In the broader
context of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), understanding the
expressivity and trainability of the ansatz has proven critical for evaluating
their performance. A key method to study both these aspects involves analyzing
the dimension of the dynamic Lie algebra (DLA). In this work, we derive novel
upper bounds on the DLA dimension for QWOA applied to arbitrary optimization
problems. The consequence of our result is twofold: (a) it allows us to
identify complexity-theoretic conditions under which QWOA must be
overparameterized to obtain optimal or approximate solutions, and (b) it
implies the absence of barren plateaus in the loss landscape of QWOA for
$\mathsf{NP}$ optimization problems with polynomially bounded cost functions

TL;DR: This paper discusses the development of high-quality diamond optomechanical crystals with embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers, achieving excellent mechanical resonance with a quality factor exceeding 1 million at cryogenic temperatures. The devices maintain coherent spin states with long coherence times and demonstrate robust optomechanical coupling across a wide range of optical powers, making them suitable for quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications. The success is attributed to advanced manufacturing techniques combining diamond crystal growth and chemical vapor deposition with nitrogen-doped layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a platform integrating mechanical and optical modes for quantum technologies, addressing the challenge of preserving quantum coherence while maintaining a high-quality mechanical mode.

Method: The method involves growing single-crystal diamond membranes using robust diamond crystal growth techniques and then overgrowing them with CVD diamond incorporating nitrogen-doped (δ-doped) layers to create the optomechanical crystals with embedded NV centers.

Result: The results include a mechanical quality factor exceeding 1e6, long coherence times up to 270 μs, robust power handling, and high optomechanical cooperativity. These outcomes make the devices highly effective for quantum applications and identify a promising path forward for hybrid spin-mechanical quantum devices.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the developed diamond optomechanical crystals with embedded NV centers represent a significant breakthrough in quantum sensing and computing, offering a reliable interface between mechanical and optical modes, and opens new possibilities for advancing quantum technologies through tailored optomechanical interactions and coherent spin states.

Abstract: Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins
are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing,
networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a
GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A
crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a
device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the
bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved
diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic
temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded
nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across
five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust
power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic
temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring
strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are
enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond
membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond
overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this
platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.

Abstract: Artificial quantum systems with synthetic dimensions enable exploring novel
quantum phenomena difficult to create in conventional materials. These
synthetic degrees of freedom increase the system's dimensionality without
altering its physical structure, accessing higher-dimensional physics in
lower-dimensional setups. However, synthetic quantum systems often suffer from
intrinsic disorder, causing rapid decoherence that limits scalability, a major
obstacle in quantum information science. Here, we show that introducing just a
few long-range interactions can mitigate decoherence, creating persistent
collective coherence in highly symmetric collective excited states. We term
this universal phenomenon "supercoherence" and show its exceptional robustness
against disorder up to a dynamical phase transition at critical interaction
strength and disorder. Supercoherence stabilizes not only coherence but also
all other quantum properties of the states, challenging traditional views on
the inevitability of decoherence in disordered interacting quantum systems and
suggesting new opportunities for quantum memory and information processing.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generalized bosonic transformation for N spin-1/2 systems with weak symmetry, enabling a systematic 1/N expansion. They apply this to four models, showing the approach captures phase transitions and dynamics accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding collective spin dynamics in systems with many particles is challenging. This paper provides a new method to simplify such systems, particularly useful for complex interactions and phase transitions.

Method: The authors develop generalized Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff transformations. By introducing two bosonic variables, they handle fluctuations both parallel and perpendicular to the collective Bloch vector. They systematically expand using 1/N and apply the method to four different models to test effectiveness.

Result: The method accurately predicts phase transitions and captures dynamics in systems like superradiance and Dicke models, even when temperature or dissipation affects the transitions.

Conclusion: This approach offers a unified geometrical framework for studying a wide variety of all-to-all systems with single-particle dissipation or finite temperature effects, making complex many-body physics more accessible.

Abstract: We develop a generalization of the Schwinger boson and Holstein-Primakoff
transformations that is applicable to ensembles of $N$ spin $1/2$'s with weak
permutational symmetry. These generalized mappings are constructed by
introducing two independent bosonic variables that describe fluctuations
parallel and transverse to the collective Bloch vector built out of the
original spin $1/2$'s. Using this representation, we develop a systematic $1/N$
expansion and write down explicitly leading and next-to-leading order terms. We
then illustrate how to apply these techniques using four example systems: (i)
an ensemble of atoms undergoing spontaneous emission, incoherent pumping and
single particle dephasing; (ii) a superradiant laser above and in the vicinity
of the upper lasing transition; (iii) the all-to-all transverse field Ising
model subject to incoherent pumping in the vicinity of its ordering phase
transition; and (iv) the Dicke model at finite temperature both away and in the
vicinity of its thermal phase transition. Thus, these mappings provide a
common, Bloch-sphere based, geometrical description of all-to-all systems
subject to single particle dissipation or at finite temperature, including
their phase transitions.

Result: The optical switch achieves 22ns rise time, 2.4dB insertion loss, and 17.5dB extinction ratio, making it suitable for applications like active multiplexing, quantum memory, and feedforward in quantum error correction.

Conclusion: The cavity-based optical switch is a significant advancement, enabling scalability and practical implementation of photonic quantum computing by overcoming key limitations in speed, loss, and efficiency.

Abstract: Optical switching remains a key outstanding challenge for scalable
fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing due to the trade-off between speed,
bandwidth, and loss. Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable
high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems.
We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation,
demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction
ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field
detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium
vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and
efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum
memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.

Abstract: Application-based benchmarks are increasingly used to quantify and compare
quantum computers' performance. However, because contemporary quantum computers
cannot run utility-scale computations, these benchmarks currently test this
hardware's performance on ``small'' problem instances that are not necessarily
representative of utility-scale problems. Furthermore, these benchmarks often
employ methods that are unscalable, limiting their ability to track progress
towards utility-scale applications. In this work, we present a method for
creating scalable and efficient benchmarks from any quantum algorithm or
application. Our subcircuit volumetric benchmarking (SVB) method runs
subcircuits of varied shape that are ``snipped out'' from some target circuit,
which could implement a utility-scale algorithm. SVB is scalable and it enables
estimating a capability coefficient that concisely summarizes progress towards
implementing the target circuit. We demonstrate SVB with experiments on IBM Q
systems using a Hamiltonian block-encoding subroutine from quantum chemistry
algorithms.

Conclusion: AWQAE为NISQ时期的量子计算提供了更高效、更灵活的QAE实现方案。

Abstract: Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) is a key primitive in quantum computing,
but its standard implementation using Quantum Phase Estimation is
resource-intensive, requiring a large number of coherent qubits in a single
circuit block to achieve high precision. This presents a significant challenge
for near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this,
we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Amplitude Estimation (AWQAE)
framework, a modular, scalable and adaptive approach that decouples estimation
precision from the number of physical qubits required in a single circuit.
AWQAE operates by iteratively estimating the phase bits in small, fixed-size
chunks, using a number of smaller, independent quantum circuits, which are
amenable to parallel processing. A key technical contribution of this work is
introduction of a phase resolution circuit and an ancilla-guided mechanism that
enables accurate chunk assignment and eigenphase reconstruction in the presence
of multiple eigenstates. This design is inherently NISQ-friendly, by lowering
circuit depth and qubit count per block to reduce decoherence and noise
effects. A key component of our approach is a robust classical post-processing
algorithm that resolves measurement ambiguities that arise during the iterative
process. This post-processing routine uses a least-significant-bit
(LSB)-to-most-significant-bit (MSB) correction to reconstruct the full,
high-precision phase estimate, ensuring accuracy. By combining a modular
quantum-classical loop with an ambiguity-aware reconstruction method, AWQAE
offers a powerful and flexible solution for performing high-precision QAE on
resource-constrained quantum hardware. Our approach demonstrates enhanced
scalability, and adaptability, making it a promising candidate for practical
applications of QAE in the NISQ era.

Motivation: The paper is inspired by the potential of silicon-based quantum technologies, particularly T centers, which are promising for quantum computing due to their spin properties and compatibility with existing silicon processes.

Method: The researchers examine several gate protocols: two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. They specifically focus on a photon interference-based scheme with feedback and employ the photon-count decomposition method to analytically calculate its entanglement fidelity and efficiency, considering imperfections. They also assess the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes.

Result: The key finding is that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback shows high success probabilities (>50%) and good efficiency, enabling analytical calculations of its fidelity and efficiency. Other schemes are also evaluated, but the scheme with feedback stands out as a promising candidate for experimental exploration.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of using T center defects in quantum computing with specifically designed photon-based gates. The enhanced understanding of these protocols provides valuable insights for future experimental work and technological advancements in quantum information processing.

Abstract: T center defects in silicon provide an attractive platform for quantum
technologies due to their unique spin properties and compatibility with mature
silicon technologies. We investigate several gate protocols between single T
centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a
near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic
dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme
with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the
photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations
of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections.
We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we
compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future
experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify or provide a novel approach to calculating propagators, which are fundamental in quantum mechanics, by employing advanced regularization techniques. It demonstrates the utility of zeta-function regularization in path integrals.

Method: The authors use Fourier series expansion of the path variable to convert the path integral into an infinite product of Gaussian integrals, which is divergent. They then apply zeta-function regularization to handle the divergence.

Result: The regularization method successfully addresses the divergent integrals, showing the effectiveness of the zeta-function as a regularization tool in this context.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that zeta-function regularization is a promising method for evaluating divergent path integrals in quantum mechanical systems involving charged particles in electromagnetic fields and anisotropic potentials.

Abstract: The Feynman Propagator of a charged particle confined to an anisotropic
Harmonic Oscillator potential and moving in a crossed electromagnetic field is
calculated in a conceptually new way. The calculation is based on the expansion
of the path variable into a complex Fourier series. The path integral then
becomes an infinite product of Gaussian integrals. This product is divergent.
It turns out that we can regularize this product by using the zeta-function. It
is a remarkable fact that the zeta-function is so well suited as a
regularizator for divergent path integrals.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new SDP hierarchy, PST, for quantum entanglement detection. It offers computational advantages over existing methods while maintaining accuracy. Numerical experiments show improved scalability and effectiveness in detecting entanglement, particularly with FOMs and IPMs. The approach shows promise for high-dimensional and noisy quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of reliably detecting quantum entanglement in high-dimensional or noisy systems, which is crucial for quantum information science. The proposed PST hierarchy offers a computationally feasible method compared to existing SDP hierarchies like DPS and EXT. The significance lies in scaling up entanglement detection for practical applications.,

Method: The paper introduces a new SDP hierarchy, PST, sandwiched between EXT and DPS. It uses partition mappings and operators to develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions. The authors also design a suite of algorithms, including FOMs and IPMs, leveraging these formulations for numerical stability and accuracy.,

Result: The numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states show that PST with FOMs scales well and detects entanglement effectively in easier cases, while the IPM approach is robust and recovers witnesses in harder instances. This improves the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. The results highlight the potential of tailored algorithmic formulations for scalable entanglement detection in high-dimensional and noisy settings.,

Conclusion: The paper presents a promising new approach for scalable entanglement detection in quantum information science by introducing the PST hierarchy and associated algorithms, addressing a critical computational challenge in the field.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement lies at the heart of quantum information science, yet
its reliable detection in high-dimensional or noisy systems remains a
fundamental computational challenge. Semidefinite programming (SDP)
hierarchies, such as the Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri (DPS) and Extension (EXT)
hierarchies, offer complete methods for entanglement detection, but their
practical use is limited by exponential growth in problem size. In this paper,
we introduce a new SDP hierarchy, PST, that is sandwiched between EXT and
DPS--offering a tighter approximation to the set of separable states than EXT,
while incurring lower computational overhead than DPS.
  We develop compact, polynomially-scalable descriptions of EXT and PST using
partition mappings and operators. These descriptions in turn yield formulations
that satisfy desirable properties such as the Slater condition and are
well-suited to both first-order methods (FOMs) and interior-point methods
(IPMs). We design a suite of entanglement detection algorithms: three FOMs
(Frank-Wolfe, projected gradient, and fast projected gradient) based on a
least-squares formulation, and a custom primal-dual IPM based on a conic
programming formulation. These methods are numerically stable and capable of
producing entanglement witnesses or proximity measures, even in cases where
states lie near the boundary of separability.
  Numerical experiments on benchmark quantum states demonstrate that our
algorithms improve the ability to solve deeper levels of the SDP hierarchy. In
particular, the PST hierarchy combined with FOMs enables scalable and effective
entanglement detection in relatively easy instances, while our IPM approach
offers robustness and early witness recovery for the more difficult ones. Our
results highlight the benefits of tailoring algorithmic formulations to
hierarchy structure to advance entanglement detection at scale.

Abstract: Programmable quantum systems based on Rydberg atom arrays have recently
emerged as a promising testbed for combinatorial optimization. Indeed, the
Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem on unit-disk graphs can be efficiently
mapped to such systems due to their geometric constraints. However, extending
this capability to arbitrary graph instances typically necessitates the use of
reduction gadgets, which introduce additional experimental overhead and
complexity. Here, we analyze the complexity-theoretic limits of polynomial
reductions from arbitrary graphs to unit-disk instances. We prove any such
reduction incurs a quadratic blow-up in vertex count and degrades solution
approximation guarantees. As a practical alternative, we propose a
divide-and-conquer heuristic with only linear overhead which leverages
precalibrated atomic layouts. We benchmark it on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, and
demonstrate feasibility on the Orion Alpha processor.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores using classical surrogates to deploy quantum machine learning solutions without quantum hardware, presents a more efficient method than prior approaches, and demonstrates scalability and accuracy on an energy demand problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing potential of quantum machine learning (QML) for industrial applications is hampered by the lack of accessible quantum hardware, making it difficult to deploy QML solutions. This paper aims to address this bottleneck by developing classical surrogates to enable QML on classical devices, facilitating industrial adoption.

Method: The authors propose a method that minimizes redundancies in generating classical surrogates from quantum models. They achieve this by reducing resource requirements, allowing the method to scale linearly instead of exponentially. The approach involves optimizing the generation process by eliminating unnecessary computations and resources.

Result: The proposed method shows high accuracy on a real-world energy demand forecasting dataset while maintaining linear scaling of computational resources. Rigorous testing on both simulations and quantum hardware validates the effectiveness and practicality of the approach.

Conclusion: The paper presents a lightweight and efficient approach to transforming quantum machine learning models into classically deployable versions, significantly advancing the practicality of QML in industrial settings. This method not only addresses the hardware accessibility issue but also serves as a valuable tool for researchers seeking to demonstrate practical quantum advantage through empirical setups.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) presents potential for early industrial
adoption, yet limited access to quantum hardware remains a significant
bottleneck for deployment of QML solutions. This work explores the use of
classical surrogates to bypass this restriction, which is a technique that
allows to build a lightweight classical representation of a (trained) quantum
model, enabling to perform inference on entirely classical devices. We reveal
prohibiting high computational demand associated with previously proposed
methods for generating classical surrogates from quantum models, and propose an
alternative pipeline enabling generation of classical surrogates at a larger
scale than was previously possible. Previous methods required at least a
high-performance computing (HPC) system for quantum models of below industrial
scale (ca. 20 qubits), which raises questions about its practicality. We
greatly minimize the redundancies of the previous approach, utilizing only a
minute fraction of the resources previously needed. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a real-world energy demand forecasting problem,
conducting rigorous testing of performance and computation demand in both
simulations and on quantum hardware. Our results indicate that our method
achieves high accuracy on the testing dataset while its computational resource
requirements scale linearly rather than exponentially. This work presents a
lightweight approach to transform quantum solutions into classically deployable
versions, facilitating faster integration of quantum technology in industrial
settings. Furthermore, it can serve as a powerful research tool in search
practical quantum advantage in an empirical setup.

*Peng-Fei Zhou,Shuang Qiao,An-Chun Ji,Shi-Ju Ran*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new method called tensor network variational diagonalization (TNVD) that significantly reduces the computational complexity of exact diagonalization for quantum many-body systems. TNVD uses matrix product states and variational quantum circuits to efficiently diagonalize large systems with up to 100 spins and surpasses the limitations of ED. The authors support their findings with numerical benchmarks and explore the connection between TNVD efficiency and entanglement properties using specific plots. The work opens a promising avenue for quantum computation in handling systems with volume-law entanglement entropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum many-body systems are difficult to study due to exponentially scaling computational resources, making exact diagonalization impractical for large systems. This paper presents a new approach, TNVD, which aims to make exact diagonalization feasible for larger systems by leveraging tensor network methods and quantum circuits.

Method: The researchers propose a tensor network-based diagonalization method. They use matrix product states and variational quantum circuits to encode the eigenstates and eigenenergies, reducing computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in system size. They employ numerical benchmarks demonstrating TNVD's effectiveness up to N=100 spins. Additionally, they investigate the relationship between TNVD's efficiency and the entanglement properties of the eigenstates, using specific plots to analyze the distribution of entanglement entropy and the density of states near zero energy.

Result: Numerical results show that TNVD surpasses ED's computational limitations, achieving results for systems up to 100 spins. The study further emphasizes the role of entanglement properties in TNVD's efficiency by exploring the distribution of entanglement entropy and the density of states, suggesting that area-law entanglement entropy is crucial for efficient diagonalization using TNVD.

Conclusion: TNVD represents a significant advancement in simulating large-scale quantum many-body systems. By encoding the full eigenenergy spectrum into matrix product states and using variational quantum circuits, TNVD not only achieves polynomial computational complexity but also opens new possibilities for future research in quantum computation, particularly for systems with volume-law-EE Hamiltonians that are difficult to handle classically.

Abstract: Exact diagonalization (ED) is an essential tool for exploring quantum
many-body physics but is fundamentally limited by the exponentially-scaled
computational complexity. Here, we propose tensor network variational
diagonalization (TNVD), which encodes the full eigenenergy spectrum of a
quantum many-body Hamiltonian into a matrix product state, and encodes the
eigenstates as the evolutions of product states using variational quantum
circuit (VQC). Thereby, TNVD reduces the computational complexity of
diagonalization from exponential to polynomial in system size $N$. Numerical
benchmarks up to $N=100$ spins are provided, which far surpass the
computational limit of ED. We further consider quantum Ising model in a random
field to reveal the underlying reliance between the efficiency of TNVD and
entanglement properties of eigenstates. Typical signs, including the
distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) versus eigenenergy and the density of
state versus EE, are suggested to indicate area law of entanglement entropy or
its violation, which are essential to the TNVD efficiency. Our work establishes
TNVD as a powerful and scalable diagonalization approach for large-scale
quantum many-body Hamiltonians. The incorporation of VQC lays a promising
pathway to applying quantum computation to address the volume-law-EE
Hamiltonians that lack efficient classical approaches.

photon-number-resolving detector capabilities. Our framework merges the linear
combination of Gaussians methodology with the coherent state decomposition of
arbitrary non-Gaussian states, forming a bridge between the Gaussian and Fock
basis representations. By tracking the Wigner function, we can simulate the
action of Gaussian channels and measurements on multi-mode systems in a fast

quantum states is convenient in this formalism, and we derive expressions for
the analytical gradients of these measures with respect to parameterized
circuit elements. We demonstrate the utility of this methodology by optimizing
the heralded preparation of a qunaught state, a crucial component for building
a fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer, with a Gaussian Boson sampling

TL;DR: Error


<details>

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The development of a continuous-variable photonic quantum computer depends on
the reliable preparation of high-quality Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states. The
most promising GKP preparation scheme is the cat breeding protocol, which can
generate GKP states deterministically given a source of squeezed cat states,
using beam splitters, homodyne detectors and a feedforward displacement.
However, analyzing the performance of the protocol under loss is cumbersome due
to the exponential scaling of the system. By representing the Wigner function
of the input states as a linear combination of Gaussians, we are able to
quickly and accurately simulate several rounds of breeding with mixed input
states. Using this novel method, we find that optical loss decreases the
overall success probability of the protocol, and prohibits the preparation of a
fault-tolerant GKP state when the loss exceeds 4\%. Our methodology is
available as open-source code.

Abstract: Recently, it was shown that quantum interference in a system containing a
polarized and unpolarized emitter can allow directional emission of photons
into a circulating cavity. Here, we ask whether high directionality of photon
emission in this system implies a high degree of quantum correlation between
the two emitters. We show that the answer is a qualified "yes", with photon
emission directionality and emitter-emitter entanglement showing a monotonic
relationship over a broad parameter range. The relationship only breaks down in
the limit of perfect directionality. Furthermore, under reasonable assumptions
for experimental parameters and stability, we show that the statistics of
measured directionality allow a reliable estimate of the concurrence. This
result implies that directionality of photon emission in the state preparation
stage can be used to determine the entanglement between the emitters, with
potential applications to more generic cases including quantum networks.

Abstract: While Clifford operations are relatively easy to implement in fault-tolerant
quantum computers,continuous rotation gates remain a significant bottleneck in
typical quantum algorithms. In this work, we ask the question: "What is the
most efficient approach for implementing continuous rotations in a surface code
architecture?" Several techniques have been developed to reduce the T-count or
T-depth of rotations, such as Hamming weight phasing and catalyst towers.
However, these methods often require additional a number of ancilla qubits, and
thus the ultimate cost function one needs to optimise against should rather be
the total runtime or the total space required for performing a rotation. We
explicitly construct surface code layouts for catalyst towers in two practical
application examples in the context of option pricing: (a) implementing a phase
oracle circuit, which is a ubiquitous subroutine in many quantum algorithms,
and (b) state preparation using a variational quantum circuit. Our analysis
shows that, at small and medium code distances, catalyst towers not only reduce
the runtime but can also decrease the total spacetime volume of rotations.
However, at large code distances, conventional Clifford+T synthesis may prove
more efficient. Additionally, we note that our conclusions are sensitive to
specific application scenarios and the choices of various parameters.
Nevertheless, catalyst towers may be particularly advantageous for early
fault-tolerant quantum applications, where low and medium code distances are
assumed and a spacetime tradeoff is needed to reduce the runtime of individual
circuit runs, such as in scenarios involving high circuit repetition counts.

Abstract: We propose a novel Hybrid Key Growing (HKG) protocol based on quantum

the quantum photon-number and photon-time-bin Degrees of Freedom (DoFs),
effectively doubling the bit-per-pulse rate compared to conventional Quantum
Key Growing (QKG) schemes. Our protocol integrates entity authentication, and
is designed for practical implementation by avoiding reliance on single-photon
sources or detectors. By incorporating prior knowledge about the quantum
channel, the scheme actively mitigates noise effects, making it suitable for
real-world conditions. Under certain assumptions on experimental efficiencies,
our approach also promises an increased key generation rate in bits per second.
Our simulation results display, first, expected outcomes to gain assurance
about the correctness of our implementation and, second, relevant dependencies
that showcase desirable properties of our scheme in regimes of low photon loss
and dephasing. In particular, within such regimes, our encoding scheme reduces
the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) while preserving the ability to detect
eavesdropping and identity-forgery attempts.

Motivation: The paper is relevant because adiabatic quantum computing is a promising area of quantum computing, and this paper presents a novel method to enhance its efficiency by coupling systems.

Method: The authors use the Landau-Zener model, couple a qubit to another system, and demonstrate that this reduces non-adiabatic transitions by over two orders of magnitude.

Result: The result is a significant suppression of non-adiabatic processes, enhancing the computational efficiency of adiabatic quantum systems.

Conclusion: The paper provides a new approach to shortcuts to adiabaticity by leveraging quantum dynamics, offering a promising method for improving adiabatic quantum computing performance.

Abstract: Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum
computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration
of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with
designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the
Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic
dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by
autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to
a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum
dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two
orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum
properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to
adiabaticity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of high-dimensional rotations in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) by introducing a cross-rotation scheme, which enables reconciliation in arbitrarily high dimensions constrained by multiples of 8. This approach significantly improves efficiency and reduces communication overhead, with simulations showing nearly optimal performance when using 64 dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the limitation in CV-QKD where high-dimensional rotations were previously lacking efficient orthogonal transformations, restricting their use beyond 8 dimensions. The development of the cross-rotation scheme aims to overcome this bottleneck, expanding the practical applications of CV-QKD in secure communication.

Method: The cross-rotation scheme involves reshaping the string vector into a matrix and applying orthogonal transformations in a cross manner to both columns and rows. This method allows for increased dimensionality while reducing the communication overhead in the classical channel.

Result: The cross-rotation technique has demonstrated significant improvements, including achievable sum-rates close to the theoretical upper bound when using 64 dimensions, making it a viable solution for enhancing CV-QKD performance.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-rotation approach introduces a scalable solution for high-dimensional reconciliation in CV-QKD, overcoming the previous dimensionality limitation and promising practical applications in secure communication.

Abstract: Multidimensional rotation serves as a powerful tool for enhancing information
reconciliation and extending the transmission distance in continuous-variable
quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, the lack of closed-form orthogonal
transformations for high-dimensional rotations has limited the maximum
reconciliation efficiency to channels with 8 dimensions over the past decade.
This paper presents a cross-rotation scheme to overcome this limitation and
enable reconciliation in arbitrarily high dimensions, constrained to even
multiples of 8. The key treatment involves reshaping the string vector into
matrix form and applying orthogonal transformations to its columns and rows in
a cross manner, thereby increasing the reconciliation dimension by one order
per cross-rotation while significantly reducing the communication overhead over
the classical channel. A rigorous performance analysis is also presented from
the perspective of achievable sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that
64-dimensional cross-rotation nearly approaches the upper bound, making it a
recommended choice for practical implementations.

manifolds but are also often marred by severe noise, obscuring the intrinsic
geometry essential for downstream learning tasks. We present a quantum
algorithm for estimating the intrinsic geometry of a point cloud --
specifically its local intrinsic dimension and local scalar curvature. These
quantities are crucial for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and
anomaly detection -- tasks that are central to a wide range of data-driven and
data-assisted applications. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm which
takes a dataset with pairwise geometric distance, output the estimation of
local dimension and curvature at a given point. We demonstrate that this
quantum algorithm achieves an exponential speedup over its classical
counterpart, and, as a corollary, further extend our main technique to
diffusion maps, yielding exponential improvements even over existing quantum
algorithms. Our work marks another step toward efficient quantum applications
in geometrical data analysis, moving beyond topological summaries toward
precise geometric inference and opening a novel, scalable path to
quantum-enhanced manifold learning.

### [74] [The Dual Role of Low-Weight Pauli Propagation: A Flawed Simulator but a Powerful Initializer for Variational Quantum Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06358)
*Zong-Liang Li,Shi-Xin Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study suggests LWPP can be used as a classical pre-optimizer to improve variational quantum algorithms by finding better initial parameters despite its unreliability as an energy estimator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how classical methods can enhance quantum computing, especially in optimizing variational quantum algorithms which are computationally intensive and sensitive to initial conditions.

Method: Investigated LWPP's reliability as an energy estimator and as a pre-optimizer; benchmarked its effectiveness on Heisenberg models compared to standard methods.

Result: LWPP, though inaccurate, guides parameters to better basins; using it as a pre-optimizer improves final accuracy and convergence in VQAs.

Conclusion: LWPP's potential as a supplementary classical tool for enhancing quantum algorithms was validated, shifting its role from simulation to optimization preprocessing.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) rely on a classical optimizer to tune a
parameterized quantum circuit, raising the question of whether classical
methods can assist in this process. In this work, we investigate the low-weight
Pauli propagation (LWPP) algorithm as a potential classical tool for simulating
the VQA circuit. We first find that LWPP is an unreliable estimator of the true
energy, limiting its utility as a direct simulator. However, we uncover its
real value: despite this numerical inaccuracy, its approximate optimization
landscape robustly guides parameters toward high-quality basins of attraction.
We therefore propose harnessing LWPP not for simulation, but as a classical
pre-optimizer to find superior initial parameters for the main VQA loop.
Benchmarking this strategy on Heisenberg models, we demonstrate a remarkable
enhancement in both the final accuracy and convergence rate, typically by an
order of magnitude, over standard heuristics. Our work thus reframes LWPP from
a flawed simulator into a powerful classical pre-processor that effectively
mitigates the notorious optimization challenges in VQAs and reduces the
computational burden on near-term quantum hardware.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines how different types of radiation affect a SQUID quantum device, showing sensitivity mainly to neutrons while gamma rays have less impact. They used experiments and simulations to analyze the device's responses, categorizing the faults into bursts and peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the vulnerabilities of superconducting quantum devices (SQUIDs) in their operation when exposed to external radiation, which is crucial for ensuring their reliability and robustness in real-world applications. SQUIDs are key in quantum computing and related fields, making understanding their behavior under various stresses essential.

Method: The researchers conducted experiments with three different radiation sources: 14 MeV neutrons, 1-800 MeV atmospheric neutrons, and 1.25 MeV gamma rays. They used Geant4 simulations to model the radiation effects and compare them with their experimental results. They categorized the SQUID's response into bursts and peaks based on the observed characteristics.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that SQUIDs are more sensitive to neutron radiation, with two distinct response patterns: bursts, which are long-lasting, and peaks, which are short-lived. Simulations corroborated these findings, indicating both neutron beams and gamma rays can significantly degrade SQUID performance. Gamma rays, despite being present, had a lesser impact compared to neutrons.

Conclusion: This study highlights the need for robust shielding and protective measures around SQUID-based quantum devices to mitigate neutron-induced decoherence. The categorization of responses into bursts and peaks aids in understanding the limitations and failure modes, enhancing the design and reliability of quantum devices in practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum devices are a promising solution to many research applications,
including medical imaging, precision magnetic field measurements, condensed
matter physics, and overcoming the limits of classical computing. Among the
available implementations, the superconducting technology is the current focus
of scientific research and industrial applications, excelling in performance
and scalability. Despite this, superconducting quantum systems are extremely
prone to decoherence, and in particular, they are highly sensitive to radiation
events. In this paper, we analyze the response of a superconducting device
(SQUID) to radiation. We expose the SQUID to beams of monoenergetic 14 MeV
neutrons (NILE - ISIS), atmospheric 1-800 MeV neutrons (ChipIR - ISIS), and
gamma rays with 1.25 MeV average energy (CALLIOPE - ENEA). These experiments
show that the SQUID is sensitive to the two neutron fields, while gamma rays at
1.25 MeV leave it mostly unaffected. Following our experiments with neutrons,
it is possible to characterize the SQUID's response and even classify faults
according to their shape and duration. We identify two categories: bursts (long
lasting) and peaks (short lived). To investigate the different responses to
neutrons and gamma rays, we employ Geant4 simulations, which highlight
differences in the deposition spectra and the energy propagation, but likewise
predict the vulnerability of the SQUID in both cases.

TL;DR: This thesis introduces new quantum identity authentication protocols using secure computational tasks and Bell states, improving upon existing methods, and presents secure QKD protocols without entanglement, establishing key rate bounds and enhancing error tolerance. The work offers a comprehensive review of QIA and QKD, highlighting innovative security enhancements and feasibility with current technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The importance of quantum communication security and efficient protocols, especially in scenarios requiring mutual authentication and practical implementations without niche experimental setups.

Method: Chronological review of QIA protocols, categorization by quantum resources and computational tasks, then design of new schemes based on controlled secure direct quantum communication, mutual authentication with Charlie using Bell states. Designed QKD protocols using photon sources instead of entanglement or singlets, proving security, establishing key rates, and evaluating error tolerance.

Result: Novel QIA protocols with enhanced security against common attacks, proven secure QKD protocols without entanglement, showing specific key rate improvements and enhanced error thresholds. Comparative evaluations demonstrating better performance than existing schemes.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the field by offering secure QIA and QKD protocols with practical implementation possibilities and advanced security features. Future research could explore further optimization and additional mitigation strategies to address still present vulnerabilities and explore potential enhancements to this framework.

Abstract: The advent of quantum key distribution (QKD) has revolutionized secure
communication by providing unconditional security, unlike classical
cryptographic methods. However, its effectiveness relies on robust identity
authentication, as vulnerabilities in the authentication process can cause a
compromise with the security of the entire communication system. Over the past
three decades, numerous quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols have
been proposed. This thesis first presents a chronological review of these
protocols, categorizing them based on quantum resources and computational tasks
involved while analyzing their strengths and limitations. Subsequently, by
recognizing inherent symmetries present in the existing protocols, we design
novel QIA schemes based on secure computational and communication tasks.
Specifically, this work introduces a set of new QIA protocols that utilize
controlled secure direct quantum communication. The proposed scheme facilitates
mutual authentication between two users, Alice and Bob, with assistance from a
third party, Charlie, using Bell states. A comprehensive security analysis
demonstrates its robustness against impersonation, intercept-resend, and
fraudulent authentication attacks. The comparative evaluation highlights its
advantages over existing schemes. Additionally, this thesis presents two novel
QKD protocols that eliminate the need for entanglement or ideal single-photon
sources, making them feasible with commercially available photon sources. These
protocols are rigorously proven to be secure against various attacks, including
intercept-resend and certain collective attacks. Key rate bounds are
established, demonstrating that specific classical pre-processing enhances the
tolerable error threshold. PHD THESIS

### [78] [Quantum Annealing for the Set Splitting Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06410)
*Sean Borneman*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a quantum annealing approach for the Set Splitting Problem with a linear scaling in qubits and high accuracy. However, current hardware limitations may hinder scalability and require future improvements for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the Set Splitting Problem, which is NP-hard, aiming for efficient quantum solutions to accelerate fields like biology and cybersecurity.

Method: Formulating the problem as a QUBO with penalty functions, ensuring qubit linearity and handling problem size.

Result: Experiments show convergence to optimal solutions with high accuracy, despite current hardware constraints limiting scalability.

Conclusion: Quantum methods show promise for solving this problem, but scalability issues must be addressed for practical applications.

Abstract: I present a novel use of quantum annealing to solve the Set Splitting Problem
using (QUBO) problem formulation. The contribution of the work is in
formulating penalty functions that ensure the ground state of the QUBO
Hamiltonian corresponds to valid solutions that split the input subsets. This
approach scales linearly in terms of the number of logical qubits relative to
problem size. Empirical tests of the proposed solution show convergence to
globally optimal solutions, with high accuracy rates over repeated trials.
Hardware limitations of current quantum annealers lead to an exponential rise
in required physical qubits, versus the theoretical linear increase, although
this can improve with future developments. Further work is needed to enhance
formulation robustness, reduce qubit requirements for embedded problems, and to
conduct more extensive bench-marking. Quantum solutions to the Set-Splitting
problem lead to reduced time complexity versus classical solutions, and may
accelerate research in biology, cybersecurity, and other domains.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy centres in nanodiamonds (NDs) provide a promising resource
for quantum photonic systems. However, developing a technology beyond
proof-of-principle physics requires optimally engineering its component parts.
In this work, we present a hybrid materials platform by photolithographically
positioning ball-milled isotopically-enriched NDs on broadband metal

cryogenic characterisation despite the limited numerical aperture imposed by
our cryostat. Our device, with SiO$_2$ above a silver reflector, allows us to
perform spectroscopic characterisation at 16 K and measure autocorrelation
functions confirming single-photon emission (g$^2$(0)<0.5). Through comparative
studies of similar hybrid device configurations, we can move towards optimally

Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum systems are foundational to quantum computation,
communication, and sensing. While traditional representations using wave
functions or density matrices are often impractical, the tomographic picture of
quantum mechanics provides an accessible alternative by associating quantum
states with classical probability distribution functions called tomograms.
Despite its advantages, including compatibility with classical statistical
methods, tomographic method remain underutilized due to a lack of robust
estimation techniques. This work addresses this gap by introducing a
non-parametric \emph{kernel quantum state estimation} (KQSE) framework for
reconstructing quantum states and their trace characteristics from noisy data,
without prior knowledge of the state. In contrast to existing methods, KQSE
yields estimates of the density matrix in various bases, as well as trace
quantities such as purity, higher moments, overlap, and trace distance, with a
near-optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{O}\bigl(T^{-1}\bigr)$, where $T$ is
the total number of measurements. KQSE is robust for multimodal, non-Gaussian
states, making it particularly well suited for characterizing states essential
for quantum science.

Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) ans\"atze have greatly expanded the accuracy and reach
of variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, in particular when
exploring the manifold quantum phenomena exhibited by spin systems. However,
the scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and
specifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on
random deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the
set-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even
bypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the
magnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples of
increasing complexity, from the classical Ising model to quantum systems with
long-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict
observables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we
show how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by
reusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes.

Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions often create conflicting dynamical objectives that
cannot be simultaneously satisfied, leading to nonreciprocal frustration. On
the other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives
in energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that
nonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a
damped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to
nonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness
against disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for
steady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a
fine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium
case. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition
driven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a
time-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by
the geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete
symmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple
harmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down.
Our predictions have important physical implications for a three-component
spinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the
structural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated
self-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation
despite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven constitutive framework for anisotropic damage mechanics using a second-order damage tensor approach and thermodynamic consistency. The model is validated through numerical and experimental examples, showing enhanced expressiveness over classical models. It also introduces a decoupled training scheme to reduce computational burden. The framework handles various material symmetries and includes damage-induced anisotropy. The results demonstrate accuracy in predicted constitutive responses under damage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for accurate and thermodynamically consistent models for anisotropic materials undergoing damage. The authors propose a novel framework using second-order damage tensors and neural networks to ensure polyconvexity, which is essential for the physical plausibility of the model. The goal is to improve the predictive capabilities of such models for applications in material science and engineering, particularly in scenarios where anisotropy complicates material behavior during damage.

Method: The method involves developing a data-driven constitutive model for anisotropic materials incorporating damage using a second-order tensor. The approach uses thermodynamic principles to ensure consistency, employing neural networks with specific properties (non-decreasing convex) to parameterize strain energy density potentials. The model enforces the polyconvexity condition and uses a damage potential to govern damage evolution. A decoupled training scheme is introduced for computational efficiency. The model is validated against various material types, including isotropic, transversely isotropic, and orthotropic materials, with both numerical simulations and experimental data on Mullins-type damage.

Result: The proposed framework shows enhanced accuracy in predicting constitutive responses under anisotropic damage compared to classical models, with evidence from numerical benchmarks and experimental validation. The use of second-order damage tensors and neural networks with polyconvexity ensured ensures accurate and physically consistent results. The decoupled training approach significantly reduces computational burden while maintaining model accuracy. The framework effectively captures damage-induced anisotropy, providing a versatile tool for modeling a wide range of anisotropic materials under damage conditions.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive and thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling anisotropic damage in materials. By using a second-order damage tensor and advanced neural network techniques, the framework addresses the challenges of material anisotropy and damage evolution. The results highlight the framework's accuracy and versatility, making it a valuable tool for material scientists and engineers dealing with complex material behaviors under damage.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven constitutive framework for anisotropic damage
mechanics based on the second-order damage tensor approach for both
compressible and incompressible materials. The formulation is thermodynamically
consistent and satisfies the Clausius-Duhem inequality. The strain energy
density potentials are expressed as isotropic functions of the right
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, along with structural tensors that encode
anisotropy either present in the virgin material or resulting from damage. To
guarantee the polyconvexity condition, non-decreasing convex neural networks
with inputs that ensure polyconvexity are used to parameterize the strain
energy density potentials. The model vanishes in the undeformed state,
fulfilling the normality condition. In contrast to classical [1-d] damage
models, the expressiveness of the new data-driven model is enhanced by
employing a family of nonlinear, convex, decreasing functions to capture the
effect of damage. Damage evolution is governed through a damage potential,
where the corresponding threshold is defined in terms of the damage conjugate
forces. As a special case of the general formulation, a new anisotropic generic
format is introduced to predict constitutive responses under damage-induced
anisotropy in initially isotropic materials. To reduce the computational burden
during training, a decoupled training scheme is introduced, and its accuracy is
demonstrated in all numerical examples. These include benchmarks for
incompressible isotropic, transversely isotropic, and compressible orthotropic
materials. The framework is also validated against experimental data capturing
anisotropic Mullins-type damage.

Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) provides a promising foundation for the
development of solid-state refrigeration technologies that could replace
conventional gas compression-based cooling systems. Current research efforts
primarily focus on identifying cost-effective magnetic materials that exhibit
large MCEs under low magnetic fields across broad temperature ranges, thereby
enhancing cooling efficiency. However, practical implementation of magnetic
refrigeration requires more than bulk materials; real-world devices demand
efficient thermal management and compact, scalable architectures, often
achieved through laminate designs or miniaturized geometries. Magnetocaloric
materials with reduced dimensionality, such as ribbons, thin films, microwires,
and nanostructures, offer distinct advantages, including improved heat
exchange, mechanical flexibility, and integration potential. Despite these
benefits, a comprehensive understanding of how size, geometry, interfacial
effects, strain, and surface phenomena influence the MCE remains limited. This
review aims to address these knowledge gaps and provide guidance for the
rational design and engineering of magnetocaloric materials tailored for
high-performance, energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration systems.

Motivation: The paper's goal is to utilize elliptical gears in mechanical systems to study topological protection and nonlinear dynamics, providing a foundation for advanced mechanical metamaterials.

Method: They analyze a 1D chain of modulated elliptical gears to observe topological edge modes using simulations, then couple them for 2D behavior. They also apply a numerical method to study stability and transitions.

Result: The system exhibits topological edge states and undergoes nonlinear transitions as amplitude increases. They also find that phase modulation creates a synthetic dimension, and nonlinearities affect topological states. A numerical method Discoveries the system's stability boundaries and delocalization points.

Conclusion: This work opens up possibilities for engineering mechanical systems with topological features, offering a novel passive platform for mechanical metamaterials with topological protection and nonlinear behaviors.

Abstract: We present a class of mechanical lattices based on elliptical gears with
quasiperiodic modulation and geometric nonlinearity, capable of exhibiting
topologically protected modes and amplitude-driven transitions. Starting from a
one-dimensional chain of modulated elliptical gears, we demonstrate the
emergence of localized edge states arising from quasiperiodic variation in the
gears' moments of inertia, analogous to the topological edge modes of the
Aubry-Andre-Harper model. Under increasing excitation amplitude, the system
undergoes a nonlinear transition, where edge localization breaks down and
energy delocalizes into the bulk. By coupling multiple such chains with varying
modulation phase, we construct a two-dimensional lattice in which the phase
acts as a synthetic dimension. This structure supports topological wave
propagation along the synthetic dimension. Nonlinearity again induces a
breakdown of topological states, leading to complex, amplitude-dependent wave
propagation. We further propose a numerical continuation approach to analyzing
the periodic orbits and their linear stability, effectively discovering the
boundary of the basin of bounded motion and detecting the occurrence of
delocalization under certain excitation amplitudes. Our results reveal that
elliptical geared systems offer a passive, amplitude-dependent platform for
exploring topological phenomena and synthetic dimensionality in mechanical
metamaterials.

*Victor Vanpeene,Olga Stamati,Francois Cadiou,Quentin Jacquet,Julie Villanova,Sandrine Lyonnard*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates how X-ray nano-holography and DVC track the structural evolution of Si-GaN anodes, linking their microstructure to electrochemical performance. Key factors identified include diffusion dynamics, particle morphology, and mechanical deformation. These insights aid in optimizing battery electrode manufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery optimization is a critical area in energy storage. Understanding how structural factors influence performance is essential for material and manufacturing advancements.

Method: Used operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holography and Digital Volume Correlation to study the microstructure evolution during the formation cycle of a high-capacity Si-GaN anode.

Result: Key findings include the impact of local diffusion channels, particle positioning, and structural heterogeneities on electrochemical activity. Identification of diffusion-driven structures helps bridge structural and operational aspects of battery electrodes.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for integrating microstructure analysis to optimize battery materials and manufacturing, making X-ray techniques beneficial for such studies.

Abstract: Linking electrode microstructure to electrochemical performance is essential
for optimizing Li-ion batteries. However, this requires mechanistic 4D
observations at ultimate spatio-temporal scales, which remains elusive. Here we
demonstrate the use of operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holo-tomography combined
with Digital Volume Correlation to track chemomechanical dynamics at both
particle (local) and electrode (averaged) scales. Quantitative scale-bridging
image analysis is applied to a high-capacity silicon-graphite anode during its
formation cycle. Our findings reveal that local diffusion properties, graphite
particle morphology and position in the electrode, distance to silicon
clusters, surface contact with electrolyte and mechanical deformations, all
have a direct impact on the local electrochemical activity and irreversibility
- but these parameters are not equally important. Particularly, we identify
fast diffusion channels that play a key role and counterbalance intrinsic
depth-dependent reaction heterogeneities due to ionic/electronic diffusion
limitations. The various structural factors that determine Gr-Si battery
performance beyond ensemble properties are classified using a scale of
influence, providing a practical framework for the optimization of materials
and electrode manufacturing.

### [88] [Single-Shot Multispectral Encoding: Advancing Optical Lithography for Encryption and Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05645)
*Hyewon Shim,Geonwoong Park,Hyunsuk Yun,Sunmin Ryu,Yong-Young Noh,Cheol-Joo Kim*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single-shot optical lithography technique that uses spatially controlled optical band gaps to produce multispectral encoding patterns, enabling encryption and high-resolution spectroscopy without dispersive optics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations in creating multispectral functional units for optical displays and sensing, which are hindered by the use of limited spectral units and reproducibility issues.

Method: The method involves using a single-shot exposure to reproduce perovskite films with optical band gaps by modulating compositions based on spatial light patterns, which encode color and spectral information.

Result: The result is the successful demonstration of multispectral encoding patterns for encryption and multivariate optical converters for spectroscopy, achieving high spectral resolution and room-temperature fabrication.

Conclusion: The technique provides a scalable and versatile solution for expanding multispectral applications in optical lithography, with potential for broader impacts in optical displays and sensing.

Abstract: Most modern optical display and sensing devices utilize a limited number of
spectral units within the visible range, based on human color perception. In
contrast, the rapid advancement of machine-based pattern recognition and
spectral analysis could facilitate the use of multispectral functional units,
yet the challenge of creating complex, high-definition, and reproducible
patterns with an increasing number of spectral units limits their widespread
application. Here, we report a technique for optical lithography that employs a
single-shot exposure to reproduce perovskite films with spatially controlled
optical band gaps through light-induced compositional modulations. Luminescent
patterns are designed to program correlations between spatial and spectral
information, covering the entire visible spectral range. Using this platform,
we demonstrate multispectral encoding patterns for encryption and multivariate
optical converters for dispersive optics-free spectroscopy with high spectral
resolution. The fabrication process is conducted at room temperature and can be
extended to other material and device platforms.

Abstract: In this study, we analyze the secret key capacity of intensity
modulation/direct detection optical key distribution (IM/DD OKD) for a
free-space optical (FSO) link between a low-Earth orbit satellite and an
optical ground station. Focusing on downlink communication, we account for
atmospheric turbulence, which causes random variations in the transmittance of
the FSO channel. We implement an atmospheric channel model that accounts for
absorption and scattering, geometric losses, pointing errors, and intensity
fluctuations. The secret key capacity is quantified under different noise
scenarios and reconciliation code efficiencies, assuming a hard decoding
scheme. The performance of the IM/DD OKD protocol is compared under direct and
reverse reconciliation regimes. Additionally, we examine the impact of weak and
strong wind on the strength of atmospheric turbulence, leading to different
results of the secret key capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics
of error distributions that arise from protocol optimization. Our results
provide insights into optimizing IM/DD OKD protocols for varying atmospheric
conditions.

Motivation: The paper's motivation is to explore methods for rapidly electrically manipulating optical resonances in metallic nanostructures to expand their applications in nanophotonics.

Method: The authors use gold nanoparticles arranged in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a polymer spacer, employing surface acoustic waves to modulate light scattering at GHz speeds.

Result: The results show mechanical deformations in the polymer and large strain levels leading to significant spectral tuning, suggesting potential for advanced dynamic metasurfaces and high-frequency polymer dynamics.

Conclusion: The approach opens new possibilities for electrically driven dynamic metasurfaces and high-frequency applications in polymer nanomechanics.

Abstract: The role of metallic nanostructures in nanophotonics is expected expand if
ways to electrically manipulate their optical resonances at high speed can be
identified. Here, we capitalize on electrically-driven surface acoustic waves
and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this
goal. We place gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a
few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves are
then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the GHz regime. We
observe evidence that the surface acoustic waves produce mechanical
deformations in the polymer, and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics
leads to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach
provides a design strategy for electrically-driven dynamic metasurfaces and
fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultra-confined
geometries.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal control of laser pulses at relativistic intensities is a
longstanding goal with broad implications in laser-plasma acceleration,
high-brightness radiation sources, and extreme-field science. Laser pulses with
helical spatiotemporal intensity profiles, often referred to as light springs,
carry multiple spectral and orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, producing a
rotating intensity profile capable of coupling directly to helical plasma
waves. Until now, light springs have only been realized on low-power systems,
limited by optical damage thresholds and large-aperture beamline constraints.
Here, we report the first experimental realization of light springs at
relativistic intensities, achieving peak intensities above $1.4\times10^{18}$
W/cm$^{2}$. Our approach spectrally splits a high-power laser pulse, imprints
distinct helical phases on each component, and coherently recombines them.
Hyperspectral imaging, off-axis holography, and spectral phase reconstruction
confirm excellent agreement with theory and reveal the potential to drive
superluminal rotational velocities. Introducing spectral chirp demonstrates
further control of the temporal evolution of the transverse mode structure.
This platform opens new regimes of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction where
laser OAM can directly couple to plasma OAM.

While traditional periodic poled methods are expensive, this study proposes a more scalable and cost-effective approach achieving excellent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the fabrication challenges of expensive periodic poled methods by developing a scalable and efficient alternative for on-chip photon sources used in quantum technologies.

Method: The method involves using TFLN micro-ring resonators with modal phase matching to achieve high-quality photon-pair generation. It combines micro-ring resonance enhancement with modal phase matching to reduce device size, fabrication cost, while maintaining efficiency.

Result: The results show that the approach achieves pair generation rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW with a coincidence-to-accidental ratio over 1200, significantly improving the efficiency and scalability of on-chip photon sources.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances the development of compact, efficient on-chip photon sources for quantum photonic applications, offering a more practical solution than existing methods.

Abstract: Efficient generation of high-quality photon pairs is essential for modern
quantum technologies. Micro-ring resonator is an ideal platform for studying
on-chip photon sources due to strong nonlinear effect, resonant-enhanced
optical fields, and high integration. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN)
micro-ring resonators with periodically poled quasi-phase matching have shown
high-quality photon pair generation. However, periodic poling technology
remains expensive and requires complex fabrication hindering its scalability
and capability for practical application in nonlinear photonic devices. To
address this, we propose a scalable approach using TFLN micro-ring resonators
based on modal phase matching to achieve cost-effective, efficient high-quality
photon-pair generation, significantly simplifying fabrication. We achieved pair
generation rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW through spontaneous parametric
down-conversion, with coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 1200. By
combining micro-ring resonance enhancement with modal phase matching, our
approach reduces device size and fabrication cost while maintaining high
nonlinear efficiency. These results advance the development of compact,
efficient on-chip photon sources for next-generation nonlinear and quantum
photonic applications.

Abstract: Selective spatial control of chemical reactions at the level of individual
nanostructures remains a significant challenge. We introduce a light-activated
system that combines plasmonic gold nanorods with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
monolayer to gate surface reactivity based on each rod's geometry under optical
illumination. Laser excitation tuned to a rod's plasmon resonance and
polarization collapses the polymer into a compact shell on that rod, blocking
reactive head groups and creating a long-lived, kinetically trapped inert state
stable for days. During this interval, orthogonal chemical transformations can
be performed on adjacent, unilluminated rods without interference. Subsequent
diffusion-limited rehydration restores the swollen brush conformation and
renews surface activity, effectively erasing the chemical memory. Numerical
simulations based on real nanorod geometries confirm that switching selectivity
follows the rods' absorption profiles. This mask-free, fully reversible
strategy turns passive polymer films into dynamic chemical interfaces, offering
a route to high-resolution patterning and on-demand control of nanoscale
reactions for electronic and sensing applications.

TL;DR: Lithium tantalate-based modulators show promising potential for high-speed optical interconnects with good performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the use of lithium tantalate in electro-optic modulators as a viable alternative to silicon-based materials for high-speed optical interconnects.

Method: The authors demonstrated wafer-scale integration of lithium tantalate films on silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits, utilizing single and IQ modulators for PAM4 and 16-QAM signals with high data rates.

Result: High-performance modulators with low optical loss, ultrafast response, and high data rates up to 581 Gbit/s were achieved.

Conclusion: Lithium tantalate is identified as a suitable material for broadening optical interconnect applications, complementing silicon photonics and offering extended propagation capabilities.

Abstract: Driven by the prospects of higher bandwidths for optical interconnects,
integrated modulators involving materials beyond those available in silicon
manufacturing increasingly rely on the Pockels effect. For instance,
wafer-scale bonding of lithium niobate films onto ultralow loss silicon nitride
photonic integrated circuits provides heterogeneous integrated devices with low
modulation voltages operating at higher speeds than silicon photonics. However,
in spite of its excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities, lithium
niobate suffers from drawbacks such as birefringence and long-term bias
instability. Among other available electro-optic materials, lithium tantalate
can overcome these shortcomings with its comparable electro-optic coefficient,
significantly improved photostability, low birefringence, higher optical damage
threshold, and enhanced DC bias stability. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale
heterogeneous integration of lithium tantalate films on low-loss silicon
nitride photonic integrated circuits. With this hybrid platform, we implement
modulators that combine the ultralow optical loss ($\sim$ 14.2 dB/m), mature
processing and wide transparency of silicon nitride waveguides with the
ultrafast electro-optic response of thin-film lithium tantalate. The resulting
devices achieve a 6 V half-wave voltage, and support modulation bandwidths of
up to 100 GHz. We use single intensity modulators and in-phase/quadrature (IQ)
modulators to transmit PAM4 and 16-QAM signals reaching up to 333 and 581
Gbit/second net data rates, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lithium
tantalate is a viable approach to broadband photonics sustaining extended
optical propagation, which can uniquely contribute to technologies such as RF
photonics, interconnects, and analog signal processors.

Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), a macroscopic quantum phenomenon arising
from phase coherence and bosonic statistics, has been realized in quantum
magnets. Here, we report the observation of a universal magnetocaloric effect
(MCE) near a BEC quantum critical point (QCP) in copper sulfate crystal
($CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O$). By conducting magnetocaloric and nuclear magnetic
resonance measurements, we uncover a field-driven BEC QCP, evidenced by the
universal scaling law $T_c \propto (B_c - B)^{2/3}$ and the perfect data
collapse of the magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio. Thermal excitation triggers a
dimensional crossover to a 1D quantum-critical regime, where the MCE scaling
strictly matches the universality class of 1D Fermi gases. Notably, the
quantum-critical MCE enables cooling down to 12.8 mK without helium-3, with
very fast thermal relaxation rate that is critical for high cooling power. This
work demonstrates the universal MCE in magnon BEC systems, using a common
copper sulfate compound as a paradigmatic example, and paves the way for
next-generation sub-Kelvin cooling.

Result: Antimonides exhibit rare-earth spin ladders with distinct magnetic behaviors, poor metal behavior, and anisotropic thermal properties, offering potential for tunable applications.

Conclusion: This discovery opens new avenues for studying spin ladders and their applications in low-dimensional magnetic systems and heterogeneous materials.

Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of a series of antimonides
Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln: La--Nd) which exhibit well-isolated, $n=2$
rare-earth spin ladders. We discuss the structure of the new compounds, with a
particular focus on the magnetic Ln spin ladders. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ and
Ce$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions and a well-defined
doublet ground state, whereas Pr$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibits a weakly magnetic
singlet ground state. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ is a poor metal with an electrical
resistivity of 0.1m$\Omega$-cm at 300K and weak temperature dependence. The
thermal conductivity along the ladder exhibits significant field dependence
even at 40K, considerably higher than the magnetic ordering temperature of
1.1K. Compared to compounds with transition metal spin ladders, the rare-earth
elements impart much lower energy scales, making these compounds highly tunable

Abstract: The interplay between charge stripes and pairing is a longstanding point of
scrutiny in a broad class of unconventional superconductors since, in some
cases, it is unclear whether their intertwining benefits the ensuing
superfluidity. Experiments that explore the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of
these systems try to tip the balance in favor of one phase or the other by
selective coupling to relevant modes. Leveraging the fact that competition
between stripes and pairing is not exclusive to fermionic systems, we explore
the photoirradiation dynamics of interacting hardcore bosons, in which density
wave phase-reversal melting gives rise to enhanced superfluid properties,
quantified by the dynamic amplification of zero-momentum occupancy and charge
stiffness. Our results, obtained using unbiased methods for an interacting
system on a ladder geometry, demonstrate how one can engineer time-dependent
perturbations to release suppressed orders, potentially providing insight into
the underlying mechanism in related experiments.

Motivation: Understanding the relationship between superconductivity and spin/density wave orders is crucial for developing high-temperature superconductors, which continues to be a significant challenge in condensed matter physics.

Method: Polarized Raman scattering is employed to analyze phononic and electronic responses, combined with model calculations involving Ni 3d orbitals to identify the 2Δ(DW) energy scale and its origin.

Result: A distinct 114 meV energy scale at 2Δ(DW) is found, indicated by a pronounced peak in the Raman response and an incoherent opening above mean-field behavior. The model suggests a multiorbital origin for this gap.

Conclusion: The study offers new insights into the instabilities in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, suggesting a multiorbital mechanism for the density wave gap, which is crucial for understanding their unconventional superconductivity.

Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity
closely intertwined with charge and spin density wave order. However,
fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated
density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital
character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize
polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman
responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant
charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon
anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of
continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this
energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic
Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and
Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale
$2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and
non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the

### [101] [Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796)
*Yanhong Gu,Joseph Barker,Jiemin Li,Takashi Kikkawa,Fernando Camino,Kim Kisslinger,John Sinsheimer,Lukas Lienhard,Jackson J. Bauer,Caroline A. Ross,Dmitri N. Basov,Eiji Saitoh,Jonathan Pelliciari,Gerrit E. W. Bauer,Valentina Bisogni*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper describes using RIXS to measure spin currents in magnetic insulators despite the challenges posed by stray fields and non-equilibrium effects. They measure magnon spin currents under temperature gradients and extract magnon transport parameters for magnon spintronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of spin electronics hinges on controlling spin currents, which conventional methods struggle to detect due to small signals. The paper addresses this by proposing RIXS as a solution, aiming to advance magnon spintronics.

Method: The method involves using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to monitor magnon spin currents in magnonic devices under non-equilibrium conditions. They employ the Boltzmann equation with the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters like magnon lifetimes.

Result: They successfully bridge the detection gap by measuring spin currents and extracting key transport parameters, suggesting the feasibility of magnon spintronics applications.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new avenues for spin electronics, enabling precise control of spin currents which are crucial for future energy-efficient devices.

Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small
magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main
contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a
pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated
electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent
distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection
methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic
x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current
carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic
order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator.
This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved
RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under
non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation
time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime
at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.

### [102] [Quantum Hall Resistance and Quantum Hall Plateaus from Edge State Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05912)
*Pedro Pereyra*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper successfully derives the quantum Hall effect formula using the Landau and Landauer-Büttiker formalisms with hard-wall boundary conditions, explaining the Hall resistance and filling factor in terms of Fermi energy and magnetic field with experimental agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The extended literature suggests a persistent challenge in deriving the QHE formula from first principles, outnumbering experimental observations and theoretical models.

Method: The paper employs the Landau and Landauer-Büttiker formalisms, imposes hard-wall boundary conditions on wavefunctions, and derives the Hall resistance by quantizing guiding center and longitudinal wave number, leading to discrete edge states and the standard formula without energy bending.

Result: Derives the Hall resistance formula with explicit filling factor expression, recurrent resistance steps matching QHE plateaus and experimental data.

Conclusion: The approach removes a significant constraint, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the QHE phenomenon.

Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on the quantum Hall effect (QHE), a direct
derivation of the phenomenological formula $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$ from first
principles has remained elusive. In this work, we revisit the Landau and
Landauer-B\"uttiker formalisms and impose hard-wall boundary conditions on the
wavefunction, an essential but often overlooked constraint. This condition
quantizes the guiding center position and the longitudinal wave number $k_x$,
leading naturally to a discrete number of edge states without invoking energy
bending. We derive the Hall resistance directly and recover the standard result
$\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$, along with an explicit expression for the filling
factor $\nu$ in terms of the Fermi energy and magnetic field. The resulting
resistance steps reproduce the observed QHE plateaus and match experimental
data without fitting parameters.

*Ken Uchino,Yuuki Ogawa,Satoru Hayami*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates the mechanism of spin current generation in altermagnets induced by elastic waves, showing a nonrelativistic antisymmetric spin-split band structure leads to spin currents when longitudinal or transverse waves are applied. The mechanism differs from relativistic Rashba systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding mechanisms for spin current generation is crucial for spintronics and potential applications in electronics and quantum computing.

Method: Theoretical analysis using linear response theory and f-wave structure in a three-sublattice noncollinear antiferromagnetic system on a triangular lattice.

Result: Antisymmetric spin-splitting causes direction-dependent spin current responses, and altermagnets offer a nonrelativistic method for spin current generation.

Conclusion: Investigates nonrelativistic mechanism for spin current generation, highlighting altermagnets as a potential alternative to relativistic systems in spintronics applications.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the mechanism of spin current generation induced
by elastic waves in nonrelativistic magnets referred to as altermagnets. By
analyzing an $f$-wave altermagnet formed by a three-sublattice noncollinear
antiferromagnetic structure breaking the spatial inversion symmetry on a
two-dimensional triangular lattice within the linear response theory, we show
that the nonrelativistic antisymmetric spin-split band structure can give rise
to spin current generation when either longitudinal or transverse elastic wave
is applied. We find that the momentum dependence of the antisymmetric spin
splitting leads to a characteristic direction-dependent spin current response.
We also compare the present nonrelativistic magnetic-order-driven mechanism
with the relativistic one in a nonmagnetic Rashba system. These findings
highlight the potential of invesion-symmetry-breaking altermagnets as a spin
current generator driven by elasticity without relying on the relativistic
spin-orbit coupling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着纳米材料在新科技中的广泛应用，如新能源和生物医学，测量它们的迁移率变得至关重要。然而，使用霍尔效应测量迁移率在纳米尺度并不适用，因此需要新的方法来补充这一空白。

Conclusion: mu_2T方法为纳米场效应晶体管的迁移率测量提供了一个创新的解决方案，扩展了在新材料开发和新科技应用中的应用可能性。

Abstract: Measuring carrier mobility as a function of the carrier density in
semiconductors using Hall effect is the gold standard for quantifying
scattering mechanisms. However, for nanostructures, the Hall effect is not
applicable, and the density dependence of mobility is generally inaccessible,
rendering Hall effect measurements impractical. Here, we present
$\mu_\mathrm{2T}(n)$, a new procedure allowing us to extract the density
dependent mobility in two-terminal measured nano scale field effect transistors
at zero magnetic field from conventional conductance vs gate voltage
measurements. We validate $\mu_\mathrm{2T}$ against standard Hall measurements
and then apply the procedure to 256 individual two-terminal InAs nanowire FETs,
extracting information about the scattering mechanisms. To illustrate its broad
utility, we reanalyze published data in which mobility had been treated as
density independent. Our method represents a new powerful tool for optimization
and development of nanomaterials crucial for a wide range of new technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract focuses on the application of microwave spectroscopy in studying Andreev bound states, aiming to advance our understanding of spin-orbit coupling in quantum wells.

Method: Microwave spectroscopy was used to detect ABSs in Josephson junctions in proximitized Ge quantum wells, comparing the experimental data with a model that includes finite-length and Coulomb interaction effects.

Result: The findings confirmed the existence of spin-degenerate absolute bound states with multiple energy levels and explained the signatures with a model including Coulomb interactions.

Conclusion: The model under finite Coulomb interaction resolves the discrepancies, indicating the crucial role of interactions in the behavior of Andreev bound states in hybrid spin-based devices using Ge quantum wells.

Abstract: Proximitized Ge quantum wells have emerged as a novel platform for studying
Andreev bound states (ABSs), due to their expected strong spin-orbit
interaction and high mobility. Here, we used microwave spectroscopy techniques
to investigate ABSs in Josephson junctions (JJs) realized in proximitized Ge
quantum wells. Spectroscopic signatures observed in a 350 nm junction indicated
the presence of multiple ABSs, and were reproduced with a model including
finite-length effects. The ABS spectra measured for a $1.2~\mu$m junction were
explained by a model including three ABSs in two conduction channels and finite
Coulomb interaction. Our work highlights the importance of interactions in JJs
and serves as a basis for understanding and manipulating ABSs in Ge-based
hybrid devices.

TL;DR: Hybrid QD-superconductor systems can create Majorana qubits in Kitaev chains. Gate reflectometry effectively distinguishes charges, identifies tunneling processes, and even detects parity without normal connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about Majorana qubits and their detection, which is a hot topic in quantum computing. The method used here involves hybrid systems and reflectometry, aiming to improve qubit detection methods.

Method: The researchers used a hybrid QD-superconductor system, which forms an artificial Kitaev chain. They employed gate reflectometry to probe charge stability, differentiate between tunneling mechanisms, and observe parity without normal leads.

Result: The study shows that reflectometry can distinguish between charge states, reliably identify tunneling processes, and detect parity changes, even when isolated. This validates reflectometry for detecting Majorana qubits effectively.

Conclusion: Their findings confirm reflectometry's utility as a reliable and non-invasive technique for detecting Majorana qubits in Kitaev chains, opening new avenues for topological qubit research.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum dot (QD)-superconductor system can be used to realize Majorana
zero modes in artificial Kitaev chains. These chains provide a promising
platform for the realization of Majorana qubits. Radio-frequency (RF) gate
reflectometry is a fast, non-invasive, and sensitive technique that can be used
to read out such qubits. In this work, we use gate reflectometry to probe two
QDs coupled via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid segment. We demonstrate
that gate sensing can resolve charge stability diagrams and clearly distinguish
between elastic cotunneling and crossed-Andreev reflection, the two key
processes that allow one to form a Kitaev chain. Furthermore, we show that this
information is accessible, even when the system is completely decoupled from
the from the normal leads. In this closed regime, we show that the observed
quantum capacitance signal is indicative of parity switching between the even
and odd ground states. Our measurements in both open and closed regimes confirm
that gate reflectometry captures the essential features of interdot coupling
and parity dynamics.

Abstract: The occurrence of charge density wave (CDW) phenomena, particularly in low
dimensional rare-earth chalcogenides, has attracted substantial research
interest. Among these materials, EuTe4, which features multiple Te layers and a
single Eu-Te layer, serves as a promising platform to study the interplay
between CDW order and 4f electron configurations, including magnetism. In this
study, First principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations were
carried out to investigate the electronic band structure modifications arising
from CDW modulation. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) revealed
the emergence of a CDW gap at the Fermi level, as well as hybridization induced
gap features at lower binding energies. The low lying CDW gap reaches its
maximum along the Gamma-Y high-symmetry direction and a minimum along GX
reflecting the anisotropic nature of the electronic structure. We also
performed low temperature heat capacity measurements in applied magnetic fields
near the Neel temperature (TN ~ 6.9 K) to construct the magnetic phase diagram
of EuTe4. This study provides valuable insight into the directional dependent
evolution of the Fermi surface nesting induced CDW ordering, along with other
observed gap openings within this system.

Abstract: Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems
and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts.
Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are
characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold
bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation
challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic
quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key
signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection
for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved
injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the
multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the
anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite
the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first
experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the
non-Abelian topological phases.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于像素计数器的X射线成像提供了一种有效的校正工具，为提高光谱分辨率提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge
sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with
pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the
determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a
preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary
polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number
of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different
combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing
probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response
matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra
acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator
electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The
technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector
and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick
silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the
reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3
offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute
percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the
spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms
and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the development and evaluation of p-type silicon detector arrays for the ALICE experiment's FoCal upgrade. The detectors showed stable performance with good signal-to-noise ratios and agreement with simulations, making them suitable candidates for the upgrade.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The article is focused on advancing detector technology for particle experiments, particularly for the ALICE collaboration, which aims to study high-energy particle interactions in the low Bjorken-x region. The motivation stems from the need for improved detectors to observe direct photons and hadrons in this challenging kinematic regime.

Method: The study involved manufacturing an 8x9 array of silicon pads on 6-inch wafers, using the HGCROC chip for readout. They conducted IV and CV measurements, tested with various radiation sources, and performed beam tests with pions and positrons. simulations using Geant4 were also performed to validate performance.

Result: The detectors showed consistent electrical characteristics, a strong MIP signal with good S/N ratio, and accurate shower profiles matching simulation results, which are crucial for effective particle detection in high-energy experiments.

Conclusion: The detectors demonstrated reliable performance and potential as components in the FoCal upgrade, contributing to the ALICE experiment's goals of advancing our understanding of particle interactions in the low Bjorken-x region.

Abstract: This article reports on the development and comprehensive evaluation of
p-type silicon detector arrays fabricated at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory
(SCL), Mohali, India. The detectors consist of an 8~$\times$~9 array of
1~$\times$~1~cm$^2$ pads fabricated on 6-inch wafers and read out using the
High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip (HGCROC). Electrical characterization
of the detector through current vs. voltage (IV) and capacitance vs. voltage
(CV) measurements demonstrated consistent breakdown and full depletion voltages
across all pads, in agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD)
device simulations. Laboratory measurements with a $^{90}$Sr source and beam
tests at PS, CERN with 10 GeV pions, showed a clear Minimum Ionizing Particle
(MIP) signal, well separated from the pedestal and uniform response of the pads
with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 5.5. The measured shower
profiles with 2-4 GeV positron beams for various thicknesses of a tungsten
absorber placed in front of the detector are found to be in agreement with the
corresponding Geant4 simulations. The performance test results for the detector
show that it is a promising candidate for the future ALICE upgrade detector
named Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The FoCal will have alternating layers of
low and high-granularity silicon pad detectors with absorbers as a part of the
electromagnetic segment, and along with its hadronic segment, will study the
direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets production in the low
Bjorken-x region.

Abstract: The presented study investigates the effects of low fluences from
$5\times10^{12}$ up to $1\times10^{14}$ particles/cm$^{2}$ of 60MeV proton and
neutron irradiation on n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (nLGADs). An nLGAD
is a silicon sensor with a highly doped gain layer that enables controlled
charge multiplication via impact ionization. In contrast to the
well-established p-type LGADs for high-energy physics (HEP) applications,
nLGADs are optimized for the detection of low-penetrating particles such as UV
photons and soft X-rays. In addition to studying their potential application in
environments with radiation backgrounds, these novel devices also enable the
exploration of the underlying phenomenology arising from the combination of
n-type bulk material with a gain layer, which degradation was previously
studied predominantly in the context of p-type LGADs. The irradiation effects
were characterized through measurements of the leakage current and capacitance
with increasing bias voltage (I-V and C-V), revealing systematic and
fluence-dependent behavior related to space charge sign inversion (SCSI) of the
n-type bulk material, which especially alters the electric field in the sensor
and thus the depletion behavior. Additionally, annealing studies were performed
to assess both beneficial and reverse annealing regimes with isothermal and
isochronal annealing. The findings are consistent with previous high-energy
proton studies and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental
behavior of nLGADs under irradiation.

crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the
charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We
describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare
their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods
can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias<5mm) and 12mm
(bias<1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO

prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant
potential for application in other similar experiments.

Motivation: 原子分辨率的4D-STEM在材料科学中具有重要应用，然而传统方法存在限制，例如固定模板的掩膜不够灵活，无法针对不同情况优化图像，因此寻找更灵活、更有效的方法来处理4D-STEM数据是有必要的。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于模板的掩膜方法，与传统的虚拟明亮场或暗场图像不同，这种方法应用了一个模式到数据中以获得掩膜，这个掩膜展示了数据与模板之间的相关性。这种方法计算上直观且通用，特别是对于厚度中等的样本，能够更好地抑制多次散射带来的干扰。

Result: 论文展示了该方法的有效性，通过在不同材料中的具体原子层成像，证明了该方法在优化4D-STEM数据方面的显著优势。

Conclusion: 该模板掩膜方法是一种高效且灵活的4D-STEM数据处理方法，特别适用于中间厚度的样本，可以显著提升成像效果。该方法在原子分辨率材料科学研究中具有广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction
pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam
across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character,
forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a
STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a "virtual" bright field or
dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a
complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to
obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the
template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image
optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom
columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as
virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the
approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti
across a domain wall in PbTiO3.These template masks provide a computationally
straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly
effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering
produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.
