A first cooling stage based on\na blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$\ntransition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\\times 10^6$ atoms at a\ntemperature of 8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using\nthe $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\\times\n10^5$ atoms down to 5 uK and reaching a density of $\\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$.\nAtoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed\nacousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a\nhigh-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes\nwe achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with\na probability of about $50\\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence\nimaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\\%$, while maintaining a survival\nprobability of $97(1)\\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a\ntemperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the\nultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes.\nThese results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that\ncombines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the\nessential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum\ninformation processing with Sr atoms."}
