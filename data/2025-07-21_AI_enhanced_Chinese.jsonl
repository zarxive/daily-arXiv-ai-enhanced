Over the past\ndecade, significant breakthroughs in silicon carbide epitaxial growth\ntechnology and device processing techniques have enabled the development of\nSiC-based particle detectors, providing a new technological pathway for\nparticle detection in high-temperature environments.\n  In this work, we fabricate a 4H-SiC PIN detector, named SIlicon CARbide\n(SICAR) and characterize its leakage current, capacitance, and charge\ncollection across varying temperatures. The results indicate that the detector\nmaintains a very low leakage current (< 10 nA) at 90 C, with no degradation in\ndepletion capacitance or charge collection performance.

We then develop a general\nframework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit\nmap to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non\ncompact $\\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan\ngenerator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods.\nInstead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral\nproblem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and\nfor short chains.

However, scaling these systems to millions of qubits for\npractical applications poses substantial challenges, particularly due to\ninterconnect bottlenecks. To address this challenge, extensive research has\nfocused on developing cryogenic multiplexers that enable minimal wiring between\nroom-temperature electronics and quantum processors. This paper investigates\nthe viability of commercial microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches for\ncryogenic multiplexers in large-scale quantum computing systems. DC and RF\ncharacteristics of the MEMS switches are evaluated at cryogenic temperatures (<\n10 K) through finite element simulations and experimental measurements. Our\nresults demonstrate that MEMS switches exhibit improved on-resistance, lower\noperating voltage, and superior RF performance at cryogenic temperatures, with\nreliable operation over 100 million cycles. Furthermore, stable single-pole\nfour-throw (SP4T) switching and logical operations, including NAND and NOR\ngates, are demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures, validating their potential\nfor quantum computing. These results underscore the promise of MEMS switches in\nrealizing large-scale quantum computing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76 commercial MEMS switches \u5728 cryogenic \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u7684\u4f4e\u6f0f\u7535\u6d41\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728 Scalable \u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f_Interconnect bottlenecks\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528 MEMS \u5f00\u5173\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86 MEMS \u5f00\u5173\u5728 cryogenic \u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684 DC \u548c RF \u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f4e\u6f0f\u7535\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684 RF \u6027\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u5355\u6781\u56db\u901a\u5f00\u5173\uff08SP4T\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\u8fd0\u7b97\u5982 NAND \u548c NOR\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "MEMS \u5f00\u5173\u5728 cryogenic \u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f4e\u7535\u538b\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "cryogenic MEMS \u5f00\u5173\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002"}}

Clock transitions (CTs), for which the system is immune to the\neffect of magnetic-field fluctuations to first order, provide a method to\nenhance the coherence time $T_2$, and to reveal mechanisms of decoherence that\nare not due to such fluctuations. Here we investigate two variants of Cr$_7$Mn,\na spin-1 molecular nanomagnet, at fields near a zero-field CT. We find that at\ntemperatures $\\le$2 K, $T_2\\sim1$ $\\mu$s at the CT using a Hahn-echo pulse\nsequence. Away from the CT, electron-spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM)\noscillations due to coupling to nuclear spins are observed and have a $T_2$ as\nhigh as $1.35$ $\\mu$s, indicating a distinct mechanism of coherence\npreservation. Dynamical decoupling with the CPMG pulse sequence yields\n$T_2\\sim\\!2.8$ $\\mu$s at the CT and up to $\\sim\\!3.6$ $\\mu$s in the ESEEM\nregime along with a demodulation of the oscillatory behavior. The experimental\nvalues of $T_2$ are largely independent of the degree of dilution of the\nmolecules in solvent or whether the solvent is deuterated, indicating that much\nof the decoherence and ESEEM arises from sources within the molecules\nthemselves. To account for decoherence, we develop a model that includes not\nonly field fluctuations but also fluctuations in the CT transition frequency\nitself. Our results can be well explained by treating the environment as a\ncombination of noise at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency and $1/f$ noise\nin the transverse anisotropy parameter $E$.

While most theoretical efforts\nto date have focused on single-mode cavities, practical implementations in\npolaritonic chemistry typically involve planar optical cavities that support a\nseries of equally spaced photon modes, determined by the cavity geometry. In\nthis work, we present a numerically exact, fully quantum-mechanical study of\nchemical reactions in few-mode cavities, revealing two key scenarios by which\nmulti-mode effects can enhance cavity-modified reactivity. The first scenario\nemerges when the free spectral range is comparable to the single-mode Rabi\nsplitting.

To perform this task, we consider the\ndynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in\nstatic spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from\nclassical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region.\nHence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining\nthe expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach\nto explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass\nassociated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of\ngalaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is\nconsistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious\ndark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a\nwell-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the\nregion of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the\ncorresponding results of the $ \\Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We\nalso consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the\nfifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of\ngalaxy.

The Shastry-Sutherland (SS) model stands out as a\nrare example of a two-dimensional spin system with an exactly solvable dimer\nsinglet ground state. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional analogue\nof the SS lattice, constructed by deforming the pyrochlore lattice to preserve\nthe local SS geometry.

We show that by conjoining\nonly quantum repetition codes, one can construct quantum LDPC codes. More\ngenerally, we provide an efficient iterative algorithm for constructing sparse\nsubsystem codes with a distance guarantee that asymptotically saturates\n$kd^2=O(n)$ in the worst case. Furthermore, we show that the conjoining of even\njust two-qubit quantum bit-flip and phase-flip repetition codes is quite\npowerful as they can create any CSS code. Therefore, more creative combinations\nof these basic code blocks will be sufficient for generating good quantum\ncodes, including good quantum LDPC codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u7ec4\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u590d\u7801\u4ec5\u80fd\u6784\u9020\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u9020\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\uff0c\u5176\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f53n\u589e\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1kd\u00b2=O(n)\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6307\u51fa\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5143\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u7801\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u6821\u6b63\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u4f55CCC\u7801\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u62a4\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7801\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4e50\u9ad8\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7801\u8ddd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7801\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u5757\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5730\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50LDPC\u7801\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u590d\u7801\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u7684CCC\u7801\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53n\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0en\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e3akd\u00b2=O(n)\u3002\u201d,", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u63a5\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u590d\u7801\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u672c\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u3002"}}

We also provide an efficient algorithm to test the Schmidt rank\nusing only two-copy measurements, and to test the operator Schmidt rank using\nfour-copy measurements. Further, our witnesses enable robust certification of\nquantum circuit depth even in the presence of noise, a task which so far has\nbeen limited to noiseless circuits only. Finally, we show that the entanglement\nphase diagram of Haar random states, quantified by the partial transpose\nnegativity, can be fully established solely by computing our witness, a result\nthat also applies to any state 4-design. Our witnesses can also be efficiently\ncomputed for matrix product states, thus enabling the characterization of\nentanglement in extensive many-body systems.

Accurate, in situ measurement of charge\nnoise could enable closed-loop control and improve qubit performance. Here, we\npropose a method for real-time detection of charge noise using a silicon\nsinglet-triplet qubit with one electron initialized in an excited valley state.\nThis valley excitation acts as a spectator degree of freedom, coupled to a\nhigh-quality resonator via the exchange interaction, which is sensitive to\ncharge-noise-induced voltage fluctuations. Dispersive readout of the resonator\nenables a continuous, classical measurement of exchange fluctuations during\nqubit operation. Signal-to-noise analysis shows that, under realistic device\nparameters, sub-microsecond measurement times are possible using a\nquantum-limited amplifier. Even without such an amplifier, sub-millisecond\nperformance is achievable with appropriately engineered resonator parameters.\nThis approach allows the probe to monitor slow drift in exchange in real time,\nopening the door to feedback and feedforward strategies for maintaining\nhigh-fidelity quantum operations. Importantly, the protocol preserves spin\ncoherence and can be run concurrently with qubit logic gates.", "AI": {"tldr": " \u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5076\u6781-\u4e09\u5076\u6781\u6001\u81ea\u65cbqubit\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684 valley \u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u9ad8\u7eaf\u5ea6\u7684\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7535\u538b\u6ce2\u52a8\u654f\u611f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6563\u5c04\u8bfb\u51fa\u8c10\u632f\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd0\u7b97\u671f\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bbe\u5907\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u5fae\u79d2\u7ea7\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u53d7\u9650\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c Millisecond \u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u4e5f\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u65cb parseFloat\uff08\u4e0d\u80fd\u8fd9\u6837\u7528\uff09\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7ef4\u62a4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c qubit \u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb qubit \u867d\u7136\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb qubit \u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u201d,", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5076\u6781-\u4e09\u5076\u6781\u6001\u81ea\u65cb qubit \u7ed3\u5408\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6563\u5c04\u8bfb\u53d6\u8c10\u632f\u5668\u7684\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u7535\u8377\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u8bbe\u5907\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u79d2\u7ea7\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5b50\u53d7\u9650\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728 Millisecond \u7ea7\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e76\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb qubit \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347 qubit \u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u6574\u5408\u5148\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Hoehn", "Artur Tsobanjan"], "title": "On the relation between perspective-neutral, algebraic, and effective quantum reference frames", "comment": "64 pages", "summary": "The framework of internal quantum reference frames (QRFs) constitutes a\nuniversal toolset for dealing with symmetries in quantum theory and has led to\nnew revelations in quantum gravity, gauge theories and foundational physics.\nMultiple approaches have emerged, sometimes differing in scope and the way\nsymmetries are implemented, raising the question as to their relation. Here, we\ninvestigate the relation between three approaches to QRFs for gauge symmetries,\nnamely the effective semiclassical, algebraic, and perspective-neutral (PN)\napproaches. Rather than constructing Hilbert spaces, as the PN approach, the\neffective approach is based on a quantum phase space parametrized by\nexpectation values and fluctuations, while the emphasis of the algebraic\napproach is on the state space of complex linear functionals on a kinematical\nalgebra. Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all\nthree formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra. We show that\nthese three approaches are, in fact, equivalent for ideal QRFs, distinguished\nby sharp orientations, which is the previous setting of the first two\napproaches. Our demonstration pertains to single constraints, including\nrelativistic ones, and encompasses QRF changes. In particular, the QRF\ntransformations of the PN framework agree semiclassically with those of the\nolder effective approach, by which it was inspired.

The standard approach to thermalisition in\nthis setting involves an environment of independent and identically-prepared\nthermal qubits, interacting sequentially for a finite duration $\\Delta t$ with\nthe system. We compare this to a two-bath scenario in which collisional qubits\nare prepared in either their ground or excited states and the environment\ntemperature is encoded in system-environment couplings. The system reaches the\nsame thermal steady state for both settings as $\\Delta t\\to 0$, although even\nin this limit they describe fundamentally different physical processes, with\nthe two-bath setup yielding a nonequilibrium state with finite heat currents.\nNon-Markovian dynamics arise when intra-environment interactions in either\nsetting are introduced.

In conventional quantum mechanics, Hermitisity is a fundamental\nproperty of Hamiltonians. However, it is known that when a system interacts\nwith its environment, its time evolution can be effectively described by\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians. NHQS are attracting attention because novel\nphysical phenomena not observed in Hermitian systems are predicted due to its\nnon-Hermitisity. In this study, I investigated the definition of current in\nNHQS. In Hermitian systems, equation of continuity(EOC) holds between the\nparticle density and the current. However, in NHQS, there are cases where the\nconventional definition of current does not satisfy EOC. Therefore, I\nconsidered the definition of current that satisfies EOC in NHQS. As a result, I\nderived current that satisfies EOC and behaves similarly to the current in\nHermitian systems with respect to physical quantities (electromagnetic fields).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u5230\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bf9\u63ed\u793a\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3EOC\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u6d41\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage\ncurrently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to\ntrain them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea\nof No\\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating\nparallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper\npresents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to\ntrain QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the\nlatter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the\nMedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world\napplicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our\napproach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of\nsimilarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller\nnumbers of epochs than these classical models.

We briefly discuss the cost of the calculations\nfor large square arrays in the context of obtaining quantum advantage in the\nnear future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u7ea7\u68af\u9ad8\u7b49\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6807\u91cf\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6570\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7K shots\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u51fa\u53cc\u7c92\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50von Neumann\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u3002\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eAquila\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86Mutual\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u9650\u6027\u3001\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\u5236\u7ea6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u9700\u8981\u81f3\u5c11\u4e24\u6761\u6709\u6548\u6837\u672c\u624d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf shots\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7684\u63a2\u8ba8\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u6700\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u91cf\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528Aquila\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u7ea7\u68af\u9ad8\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u6807\u91cf\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574 Rydberg \u539f\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316filtration\u5904\u7406Mutual Information\uff0c\u4eceAquila\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7684bitstrings\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u5236\u7ea6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u9650\u6027\u3001\u53bb\u76f8\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7Aquila\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u53cc\u7c92\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50von Neumann\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u7684 Preparement\u662f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5236\u7ea6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u672a\u6765\u8f83\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u7ea7\u68af\u9ad8\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u6807\u91cf\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f18\u5316Mutual Information\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
