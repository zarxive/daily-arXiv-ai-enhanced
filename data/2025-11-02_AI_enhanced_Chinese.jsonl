Near solid oxide surfaces, water\nbehaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and\nincreased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable\nmodeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally\nprohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales\nare required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained\nfrom electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have\nemerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy\nat dramatically reduced computational expense.

In this work, we investigate phase\nnoise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in\nthe presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse\nits dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline,\nlarge-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework\nto derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in\nposition-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations.\nApplied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation\nexperiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency\nalso amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of\nthe atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of\nits centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability.\nAlternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of\nmagnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved\nphase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the\nwavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift\ngradient and final cloud position.

This linearity encodes the superposition\nprinciple, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break\ndown in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum\nevolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this\nbreakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the\ncircuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an\nanti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use\nquantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective,\nnonlinear Hamiltonian.

Through\nextensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation\nstrategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our\nlargest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates,\nwhich H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our\nextrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor\nnetworks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same\ninstance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a\npotentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone\ntoward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking\nprotocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for\ndesigning these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our\nextrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove\nhardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the\ninput and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining\nwhether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the\nproblem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly\naccepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an\napplication of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption\nscheme~\\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}.\nWe make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try\nadditional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even\nwith novel classical techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528Quantinuum H2\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Heuristic Quantum Advantage\uff08HQA\uff09,\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6,\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u6b64\u5916,\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u662f\u5426\u4e3apeaked Circuit\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u662fQCMA-complete\u7684,\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55,\u786e\u8ba4\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u662f\u5426\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0HHQP\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728Quantinuum H2\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5cf0\u503c\u7684\u7535\u8def(HQAP circuits),\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4eff\u771f,\u5982\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cBelief Propagation\u7b49,\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862000\u4e2a\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53cc\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8,\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec52\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u5cf0\u503c\u4f4d\u4e32\u3002\u800c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97,\u5982\u4f7f\u7528Belief Propagation\u548cPauli\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u62df\u5668,\u9884\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916,\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5,\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6570\u5343\u5e74\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u65b9\u9762\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u534f\u8bae\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u6b64\u5916,\u5cf0\u503c\u7535\u8def\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u4e3a\u540e\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u52a0\u5bc6\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

However, they can be\ncomputationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems,\nwhich limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models\nreduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations\ncommonly termed beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise,\ncomplicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG\nmodels inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly\nto all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only\nstate-specific quantities available for training. Here, we apply a knowledge\ndistillation framework by first training an initial CG neural network potential\n(the teacher) solely on CG-mapped forces to denoise those labels, then distill\nits force and energy predictions to train refined CG models (the student) in\nboth single- and ensemble-training setups while exploring different force and\nenergy target combinations. We validate this framework on a complex molecular\nfluid - a deep eutectic solvent - by evaluating two-, three-, and many-body\nproperties and compare the CG and all-atom results.

We then\nsystematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with\ndimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet\ndimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5de6\u3001\u53f3\u624b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff1a Kalb-Ramond\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u5177\u6709\u4e94\u7ef4\u548c\u516d\u7ef4\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5728\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548cGR\u7269\u7406\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5de6\u3001\u53f3\u624b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u5728\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de6\u3001\u53f3\u624b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u632f\u5e45\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u573a\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u89e3\uff1b\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a Kalb-Ramond\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u56db\u7ef4\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u5177\u6709\u4e94\u7ef4 Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet \u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u516d\u7ef4\u6697\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u975e\u6781\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u63a8\u5e7fGR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This\ncombined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers\na robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for\nintegrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby\nmaintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing\nquantum technologies and compact optical circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408PMMA\u5c01\u88c5\u548cXeF2\u8f85\u52a9\u7684FIB\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u76842D\u91d1\u5c5e\u53cc\u8272\u6563\u5316\u5408\u7269\uff08TMDC\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5149\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77402D TMDC\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u6280\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5fae\u7eb3\u52a0\u5de5\u65f6\u4e0d\u9020\u6210\u635f\u574f\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86PMMA\u5c01\u88c5\u5c42\u548cXeF2\u8f85\u52a9\u7684FIB\u6280\u672f\uff0cPMMA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u727a\u7272\u5c42\u5438\u6536\u79bb\u5b50\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8c\u6b21\u635f\u5bb3\uff1bXeF2\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86Ga\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u548c(anisotropic)\u8868\u9762\u53bb\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5149\u6548\u5149\u6805\u548c\u5149\u73af\u7b49\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86TMDC\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5236\u5907\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Prepared for submission to MNRAS", "summary": "The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have\nbecome the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in\ncurved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable\nreconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining\nstrong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the\nGRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high\nmagnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as\nelectron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an\nexplicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the\nstrong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be\ncrucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid\nmodel which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an\narbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared\nelectromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus\nallowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model\nmay be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the\nrelativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered\nin the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity.\nWe present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid\nequations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD\nequations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our\nmultifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the\nmagnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate\nsignificantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both\nblack hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either\naccuracy or stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "A general relativistic multifluid model extending GRMHD with multiple relativistic fluids interacting through a shared electromagnetic field is presented.

The method utilizes\ncounterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an\niterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward\nlow-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration\ncorrespond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By\naggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method\nreconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a\nscalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the\ntotal variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann\ndistribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random\ncouplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through\ntransfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass\nHamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that\nclassical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the\nstate-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to\nthree orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS,\ncorresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage.

The existence of such a\nframe depends on the use of edge mode variables, which we argue are generally\nrequired to upgrade a local gauge-fixing condition to a global 'frame-fixing'.\nTo analyze the effects of quantum diffeomorphism anomalies on these structures,\nwe then establish an 'effective' classical description in which the\nRaychaudhuri equation, symplectic form, and edge mode variables all acquire\nVirasoro-type deformations. Within this framework, we identify three distinct\ndiffeomorphism actions: reparametrizations (gauge transformations),\nreorientations (physical symmetries of the reference frame), and dressed\nreparametrizations.

The most\nintriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair\nformed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry.

Our methods and findings offer not only practical applications for\nquantum networks, but also lead to a deeper understanding of multipartite\nentanglement structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\uff08LOCC\uff09\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u53ef\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u65e0\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6ce2\u591a\u5c14\u65af\u57fa-\u7f57\u68ee\uff08EPR\uff09\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e00\u4e2aEPR\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u9690\u85cf\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u56de\u6536\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u56de\u6536\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u516b\u5149\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LOCC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u53ef\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86 multipartite \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u8d85\u6fc0\u6d3b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c paper \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u53ef\u5206\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4e0d\u5177\u5907 EPR \u5bf9\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e00\u4e2a EPR \u5bf9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 multipartite \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u6fc0\u6d3b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 multipartite \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, as typical to any\nquantum resource, network nonlocality is also vulnerable to environmental\nnoise, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. Environmental interactions are\nmodeled in terms of quantum channels. In the present study, we introduce and\ncharacterize network nonlocality breaking channels. Network nonlocality\nbreaking channels model environmental influences which results in the loss of\nresource, i.e., the system loses its nonlocal resource due to such\ninteractions. The study is done in the ambit of some suitably chosen\ninequalities in (i) linear networks and (ii) star-shaped networks. Further, the\nloss in full network nonlocality is also studied. Furthermore, we also\ncharacterize quantum channels according to their ability in preserving quantum\nresources, i.e., they do not break network nonlocality, which enables one to\nidentify useful quantum channels in networks.

Among them, embezzling catalysts stand out for achieving\nnear-perfect performance while tolerating only minimal disturbance, bridging\nthe gap between ideal and practical catalysis. Yet, this superior capability\ncomes at a cost: Each use slightly degrades the catalyst, leading to an\ninevitable accumulation of imperfection. This gradual decay defines their most\ndistinctive property -- reusability -- which, despite its fundamental\nimportance, remains largely unexplored.

We identify four key challenges to represent those\npulse abstractions at: the user-interface level, at the compiler level\n(including the Intermediate Representation (IR)), and at the backend-interface\nlevel (including the appropriate exchange format). For each challenge, we\npropose concrete solutions in the context of MQSS.

Here, we propose and\ninvestigate two theoretical protocols for fast single-shot readout of\ncavity-coupled single T center electronic spins. For fluorescence-based\nreadout, we selectively couple one of the T center spin-conserving transitions\nto a single-mode photonic cavity, exploiting the enhancement of the\nfluorescence emission and cyclicity. For reflection-based readout, we leverage\nthe spin-dependent cavity reflection contrast to generate the qubit readout\nsignal. We show that the cavity reflection approach enables high-fidelity spin\nreadout even when the T center only has a modest cyclicity. With realistic\nsystem parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\\times10^5$ and T center\noptical linewidth $\\Gamma/2\\pi = 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout\nfidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $\\mu$s for both spin readout protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, systematic design\nmethods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are\nlacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial\ntransmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive\nnetwork synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space:\nperiodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent\ncomponents, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in\nspatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric\nprocesses, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in\nsuperconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation\nbetween interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic\ninductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped\nJosephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission\nline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u635f\u8017\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u4f20\u8f93\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8feb\u5728\u7709\u776b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5468\u671f\u6027\u52a0\u8f7d\u5408\u6210\u548c\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5408\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u83b7\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u52a8\u80fd\u611f\u5e94\u578b\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u6cf5\u6d66\u578b\u7684\u78c1\u963b\u578b\u626d\u7ed3\u4f20\u8f93\u7ebf\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u957f\u6ce2\u6bb5\u653e\u5927\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u3002"}}
