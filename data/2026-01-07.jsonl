While ground states at integer fillings are typically identified as quantum Hall ferromagnets within a Hartree-Fock framework, we propose the existence of symmetric topological Mott insulators (STMIs) that transcend this Slater determinant picture. Focusing on half-filling of each flavor per unit cell, we demonstrate the existence of STMIs which exhibit a quantized charge or spin Hall response. We first establish this phase in a bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with localized orbitals on the $A$ sublattice and dispersive band on the $B$ sublattice. Starting from a trivial Mott insulator on the $A$ sublattice, tuning the sublattice potential drives a Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) transition of the associated $p-\\mathrm{i}p$ exciton pairing, realizing a topological Mott insulator with $C=1$ per flavor. We further generalize this construction to a single-layer spinful model, where the resulting STMI hosts charge edge modes coexisting with bulk local moments. A Mott semimetal is identified at the quantum critical point between the STMI and the trivial Mott insulator. Finally, we discuss applications to AA-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$, proposing a ferromagnetic Chern insulator phase as a low-temperature descendant of the symmetric Mott semimetal."}

Building on a ``parity-graded'' representation [1], we prove that any continuous fermionic wavefunction on a compact domain can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a linear combination of K antisymmetric basis functions--such as pairwise products or Slater determinants--multiplied by symmetric functions. A key result is that the number of required bases is provably small: K=1 suffices in one-dimensional continua (and on lattices in any dimension), K=2 suffices in two dimensions, and in higher dimensions K grows at most linearly with particle number. The antisymmetric bases can be learned by small neural networks, while the symmetric factors are implemented by permutation-invariant networks whose width scales only linearly with particle number. Thus, Fermi Sets achieve universal approximation of fermionic wavefunctions with minimal overhead while retaining clear physical interpretability."}

Ho-based pyrochlores host a dipolar spin-ice ground state, characterized by Ising moments constrained by the ice rules and elementary excitations analogous to magnetic monopoles. Here we examine how controlled chemical disorder influences this state by introducing site mixing on the non-magnetic $B$-site in two compounds. Ho$_2$GaSbO$_7$ contains only Ga$^{3+}$/Sb$^{5+}$ charge disorder, whereas Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$ exhibits both charge and substantial size disorder arising from the large ionic-radius mismatch between Sc$^{3+}$ and Sb$^{5+}$. Although both materials retain the pyrochlore structure, neutron scattering measurements reveal a reduced correlation length for the $R/B$-site cation ordering and enhanced local structural distortions in Ho$_2$ScSbO$_7$. Despite these structural differences, bulk thermodynamic measurements and magnetic diffuse scattering demonstrate that both systems exhibit the defining signatures of a dipolar spin-ice state. Low-energy inelastic neutron spectroscopy further uncovers broad magnetic excitations that develop within the dipolar spin-ice regime, a feature absent in pristine Ho pyrochlores and indicative of disorder-induced splitting of the non-Kramers ground-state doublet. Together, these results show that controlled disorder generates tunable transverse-field-driven quantum fluctuations in Ho-based pyrochlores, although the dipolar spin-ice state is remarkably robust to this disorder."}

The obtained dark soliton solutions are classified into two distinct types, referred to as type-I and type-II dark solitons, which exhibit fundamentally different structural and dynamical characteristics. A single type-I dark soliton is symmetric about its center and admits three distinct valley profiles, namely single-valley, double-valley, and flat-bottom structures, whereas a single type-II dark soliton only supports a single-valley profile. These two types of dark solitons differ in their phase behaviors as the spatial variable varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, as well as in their velocity--amplitude relations. For multiple pure type-I dark solitons, collisions are shape-preserving; however, a nontrivial collective effect is revealed in which modifying the parameters of one soliton can induce changes in the profiles and amplitudes of the other solitons, even though all collisions remain elastic in nature. In contrast, multiple pure type-II dark solitons behave independently, undergoing only phase shifts without any modification of their shapes or amplitudes. When type-I and type-II dark solitons coexist, their interactions lead to genuine shape-altering collisions, where the valley structures and amplitudes of type-I dark solitons are modified, while type-II solitons remain unaffected except for phase shifts. Asymptotic analysis further shows that the influence of type-II dark solitons on type-I dark solitons is confined to the pre-collision stage and disappears after the interaction."}

This Review surveys recent advances in the field and highlights three emerging directions: (i) the incorporation of deep-learning approaches for virtual staining, phenotypic classification, and automated analysis; (ii) the extension of HT to structurally complex biological systems, including organoids and thick tissue specimens; and (iii) the integration of HT with complementary modalities, such as Raman and polarization-sensitive microscopy, to enhance molecular and biophysical specificity. We summarize current HT applications spanning subcellular phenotyping, metabolic and mechanical profiling, and early-stage clinical studies in areas such as infectious disease and pathology. Finally, we discuss remaining technical and translational challenges and outline a roadmap for the prospective integration of HT into digital pathology and high-throughput screening workflows."}

Mass spectrometry, combined with fragment correlation analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is used to identify the molecular origin of the neutral and ionic products. Singly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2, while doubly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2 along with H+, H2+, and H3+, all within 1 ps. Electronic-structure calculations show that H, H+, H2, H2+, and H3+ originate predominantly from hydrogen atoms bound to the boron center and that their formation proceeds through hydrogen migration and, in some channels, neutral H2 roaming. The calculations further indicate that the dication meets the structural and energetic requirements for neutral H2 release, a prerequisite for forming astrochemically relevant H3+. However, the large adiabatic relaxation energy causes most roaming H2 to dissociate before proton abstraction, suppressing H3+ formation. These results provide new insight into dissociative ionization pathways in hydrogen-rich molecules, extend mechanistic principles developed for halogenated alkanes to ammonia borane, and suggest implications for hydrogen-release chemistry in ammonia-borane-based storage materials."}

For a collapsing flat FLRW dust interior we compute the explicit first-order corrections to the scale factor, the stellar radius, and the horizon formation time. We then use these results to obtain the shift in the PBH formation threshold $δ_c$. The perturbative effect is small for PBHs forming in the deep radiation era, but becomes important when the background curvature is high. To access this early regime we reformulate the theory in the Einstein frame, where the model becomes GR plus the scalaron field $φ$ with the Starobinsky potential. We provide the complete ODE system governing both the cosmological background and the evolution of an overdense closed FLRW patch.

Microelectromechanical resonators offer a promising platform for reservoir computing as they inherently possess the requisite nonlinear and temporal properties while also facilitating the integration of sensing and computing within a single platform. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a physical reservoir computing platform based on two capacitively coupled drum resonators, operating in the MHz frequency regime. Taking advantage of the concept of phonon-cavity electromechanics, a pump tone is applied at the sideband of the phonon cavity while probing one of the coupled modes, analogous to optomechanical systems, thereby creating nonlinear dynamics in energy transfer between the two resonators. Physical reservoir computing is implemented by exploiting the nonlinear response induced through pump amplitude modulation in combination with a time-delay feedback loop, and the performance is evaluated using both parity and Normalized Auto-Regressive Moving Average benchmarks. This work demonstrates a compact microelectromechanical platform for the integration of sensing and reservoir computing. Moreover, the sideband pumping scheme can further extend conventional single resonator reservoir computing to a multimode architecture."}

Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) offers high precision, yet the 2pi ambiguity of the wrapped phase means that conventional absolute phase recovery typically relies on multiple coded patterns, sacrificing temporal resolution. Deep learning-based composite FPP (CFPP) shows promise for single-shot phase recovery from a composite fringe, but limited interpretability makes it difficult to assess reconstruction reliability or trace error sources in the absence of ground truth. To address this, we propose HSURE-CFPP (Heteroscedastic Snapshot-ensemble Uncertainty-aware Ratio Estimation for CFPP). HSURE-CFPP predicts the numerator-denominator ratio used for wrapped-phase computation with a heteroscedastic snapshot-ensemble network, enabling ultra-fast 3D imaging from a single composite fringe and producing pixel-wise uncertainty maps for confidence assessment and unreliable-region identification. Specifically, a heteroscedastic likelihood jointly estimates pixel-wise noise variance to capture data uncertainty, while a snapshot ensemble quantifies model uncertainty via dispersion across snapshots, yielding total predictive uncertainty as an interpretable reliability measure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes demonstrate that HSURE-CFPP achieves high-accuracy reconstruction at high speed and that the predicted uncertainty correlates well with reconstruction errors, providing a deployable quality-assessment mechanism for deep-learning-based FPP."}

Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology."}

We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips. Particularly in strict synchronization regime, the phase of the oscillator will follow arbitrary slowly-varying drive phase and under amplitude modulation its amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed."}

Infrared (IR) spectra of HCl, H2O, NH3, and acetone are mapped into the audible range using a simple anharmonic oscillator model and NIST vibrational data. Comparing harmonic and anharmonic sonifications reveals systematic pitch flattening, beating, and the emergence of combination bands, which are analyzed with spectrograms and autocorrelation functions. A time-dependent model of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in acetone, implemented by \"plucking\" a single mode, produces evolving sound textures that mirror energy flow through the molecule. These results suggest that sonified IR spectra can provide an intuitive, pedagogical window into anharmonicity, mode coupling, and IVR."}

To measure the electric field, produced by an electron beam, we excite thermal rubidium atoms to a highly excited Rydberg state via a two-photon ladder transition and detect Stark shifts of Rydberg states by monitoring frequencies of the corresponding electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) transmission peaks. We addressed several technical challenges in this approach. First, we use crossed laser beams to obtain spatial information about the electron beam position and geometry. Second, by pulsing the electron beam and using phase-sensitive optical detection, we separate the true electron beam electric signature from the parasitic electric fields due to photoelectric charges on the windows. Finally, we use a principle component analysis to further improve signal quality. We test this method to detect the current and to reconstruct a 2D profile of a 20 keV electron beam with currents ranging from 25 - 100 uA.

Here, we introduce defect landscape engineering, the deliberate creation of vacancy clusters prior to helium exposure, as a general strategy to suppress helium-induced degradation. Using α-SiC as a model, we combine advanced microscopy, strain mapping, helium depth profiling, positron annihilation spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations to demonstrate that tailored pre-damage transforms helium defect evolution. Instead of forming extended platelets and nanocracks, helium is trapped in stable, uniformly dispersed nanobubbles. Simulations reveal that small vacancy clusters act as dual-function sinks for irradiation-induced interstitials and preferential helium traps, fundamentally altering cascade recombination dynamics. This mechanism is composition-independent and scalable, offering a new design principle for radiation-tolerant ceramics across carbides, nitrides, and oxides. By viewing defect control as a tunable parameter instead of a fixed material property, this work outlines a possible design route toward enhanced radiation tolerance in ceramics used in extreme environments."}

Combining three representative boundary types enables topological waveguides with flexible designability and enhanced functionality. However, one of the three, namely the armchair boundary, has long been limited by inter-valley scattering, resulting in weak topological protection and severely restricting its use in practical devices. This long-standing constraint is a major barrier to realizing broadly applicable topological waveguide systems. Here, to address this challenge toward a broadly applicable design framework for topological waveguides, we experimentally demonstrate that topological adiabatic geometry implemented in a micro electromechanical system suppresses valley mixing. We found that the adiabaticity enhances immunity to defects and increases the transmission efficiency of the armchair boundary. As the adiabaticity increases, topological protection is recovered over an increasingly broad portion of the bulk band gap, extending from low to high frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the recovery of protection in the adiabatic armchair boundary enables waves to propagate through 90^° and 150^°-bent waveguides by coupling with other interface geometries. Suppressing valley mixing via adiabaticity paves the way for a universal design framework for topological waveguides and for restoring robust topological characteristics across a wide range of wave phenomena."}

The AdS boundary conditions (in any dimension) require us to impose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the standard Euclidean axion $χ_E$. Fixing its asymptotic values on two boundary spheres to $\\pm χ_{E,\\infty}$, we find such wormholes to be subdominant to a UV-sensitive endpoint contribution for $χ_{E, \\infty}$ near the real axis, and that (with our conventions) they become dominant only for $χ_{E, \\infty}$ near the negative imgainary axis. Furthermore, such wormholes are irrelevant to our computation for ${\\rm Im} χ_{E, \\infty} >0$ (in the sense that the associated ascent contour fails to intersect the contour of integration).

We analyze a memory-assisted quantum clock interferometer in which a frequency-bin photonic clock is stored in two vertically separated quantum memories for a controllable duration, such that the joint state evolves in a quantum superposition of two proper times. After retrieval, the photonic modes interfere in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer, for which we derive analytic expressions for the resulting multiphoton detection statistics. Extending this HOM-based scheme from entangled photon pairs to frequency-entangled 2N-photon inputs, we show that the proper-time dependent phase is amplified by a factor N, leading to an N-times faster collapse and revival of the interference signal compared with the two-photon case. Incorporating finite memory efficiency and lifetime, we identify regimes where this modulation remains observable. For parameters compatible with demonstrated Rb and Cs memories and achievable optical frequency separations, the first collapse occurs for height differences in the order of 10-100 m with subsecond to few-second storage times, while suitable rare-earth ion and alkali memory combinations can reduce the required height to the few-metre scale.

Accepted for publication in PLB", "summary": "Barrow and Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) are two recent extensions of the standard HDE framework, obtained by introducing generalized entropy corrections through the Barrow and Tsallis formalisms. In this work, we examine the cosmological consequences of Barrow and Tsallis HDE implemented with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) infrared (IR) cutoff. After deriving the modified Friedmann equations within the thermodynamic-gravity conjecture, we study the background evolution in both non-interacting and interacting dark sector scenarios, emphasizing the role of the entropic parameter in shaping late-time dynamics. We then confront the model with state-of-the-art observations, including PantheonPlus and Union3 Type Ia supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers and DESI DR2 BAO measurements. Using Bayesian MCMC methods, we constrain the model parameters and compare the performance of BHDE with that of $Λ$CDM. Our results show that BHDE is compatible with current data and can exhibit a mild statistical preference over the concordance model for certain dataset combinations. Overall, the analysis underscores the relevance of generalized entropy frameworks in late-time cosmology and identifies Barrow-Tsallis holography with the GO cutoff as a competitive alternative to $Λ$CDM."}

Beyond the topology of individual degeneracies, their mutual interactions yield richer phenomena. A representative example is the anomalous non-annihilating collision of pairwise-created degeneracies, previously believed to occur only in non-Abelian multiband systems. Here, we theoretically reveal and experimentally demonstrate that such an anomalous collision can emerge even in a simple two-band system without non-Abelian nature. In a two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattice whose Brillouin zone forms a nonorientable Klein bottle, two EPs with opposite topological charges, pairwise created from a hybrid point, merge into a new vortex point upon re-encounter, instead of annihilating. Remarkably, the hybrid point is a defective degeneracy featuring no eigenenergy braiding, whereas the vortex point is a non-defective degeneracy yet exhibits nontrivial eigenenergy braiding. This process manifests a non-Hermitian phase transition from a gapped phase to a gapless phase, a scenario that we directly observe in a hybrid-dimensional acoustic lattice via momentum-resolved band braid and Berry phase measurements. Our findings identify nonorientability as a new arena for engineering band degeneracies and topological phases, and pave the way for experimentally exploring the interplay between exceptional and nonorientable topology."}

Contrary to the principle of symmetry inheritance in free-space optics, where the symmetry of any structured field is strictly constrained by that of its source, we show that strong SOI enables quasi-symmetry-protected formation of meron lattices even when the underlying optical sources violate the nominal rotational symmetry. By analyzing the Hermiticity of the electric-dipole radiation amplitude in a circular polarization basis, we derive an effective mirror operator acting only on a subset of C3 polarized dipole emitters, forming a quasi-symmetry group that commutes with SOI. This quasi-symmetry guarantees exact C3 merons and gives rise to a robust polarization zone within which continuously varying input polarizations generate identical topological textures. Our work establishes quasi-symmetry as a new fundamental principle in optical physics and opens pathways to engineered topological structures of light beyond conventional symmetry constraints."}

Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena."}

This interaction enables a nontrivial interplay between topology and nonlinear dynamics in soliton pumping. In the weakly interacting regime, the ground-state soliton undergoes quantized Thouless pumping. At intermediate interaction strengths, soliton creation and annihilation break adiabaticity and disrupt quantized transport. In the strong-coupling regime, the coexistence of ground- and excited-state solitons leads to negligible coupling at energy crossings, giving rise to discrete time-translation symmetry breaking (DTTSB) in the soliton dynamics. Comparison of mean-field results with exact diagonalization along closed circular pumping paths confirms both the validity of the mean-field description and the robustness of DTTSB across different pumping trajectories. Our findings reveal how interaction-induced effects can fundamentally modify topological transport and suggest that these phenomena may be explored in cold-atom, photonic, and superconducting-circuit platforms."}

Our results provide comprehensive mathematical and operational toolkits for Gaussian covariant operations, including a peculiar pair of asymmetry measures that are completely non-extensive. Our findings also reveal surprising consequences of the interplay among symmetry, Gaussianity, and thermodynamic constraints, suggesting that real-world scenarios with multiple constraints have a rich structure not accessible from examining individual constraints separately."}

In a quantum control experiment, this means learning system-bath parameters and driving coupling strengths.

We develop and compare two computational approaches based on two-photon absorption photoluminescence signals: an optimization-based minimization scheme and a feed-forward neural network. The robustness of our approach highlights the importance of reliable parameter estimation in designing effective coherent control protocols.

Under this assumption, we derive a series of modified dispersion relations that have not been previously explored, and we analyze their implications. Our findings indicate that the scales of Lorentz violation for massive particles are proportional to their masses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hypothesis aligns well with existing phenomenological results regarding Lorentz violation observed in photons, neutrinos, and electrons."}

We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips. Particularly in strict synchronization regime, the phase of the oscillator will follow arbitrary slowly-varying drive phase and under amplitude modulation its amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed."}

Here, we developed an integrated optomechanical platform on thin-film lithium niobate with precisely engineered optical, mechanical, and thermal fields within a compact 40 μm by 40 μm footprint. The platform integrates suspended microring resonators with ultrathin central membranes, reducing mechanical stiffness and effective mass while maintaining a high optical factor Q_o of 1e6 and mechanical quality factor Q_m of 1117, which increases to 5.1e4 after oscillation. The design suppresses thermal dissipation into the silicon substrate and enhances thermal sensitivity, achieving a temperature coefficient of frequency of -124 ppm/K and a noise-equivalent power of 6.2 nW/sqrt(Hz) at 10 kHz at room temperature.

Submitted to Crstal Growth & Design", "summary": "We investigate an intrinsic step-jamming phenomenon at the nanometer scale on Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)-like kinetically roughened crystal surfaces that arises during interface-limited steady crystal growth or retreat. Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed."}

We introduce the new concept of ``Multi-Valued Input Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller (MVI-RM)\" forms. Our decoder-based circuit uses three logical levels in contrast to commonly-used methods based on Exclusive-or Sum of Products (ESOP) with two levels (AND-XOR expressions), realized by Toffoli gates. In general, the high number of input qubits in the resulting Toffoli gates is a problem that greatly impacts the quantum cost. Using decoders decreases the number of input qubits in these Toffoli gates. We present two practical algorithms for three-level circuit synthesis by finding the MVI-FPRM: products-matching and the newly developed butterfly diagrams. The best MVI-FPRM forms are factorized and reduced to approximate Multi-Valued Input Generalized Reed-Muller (MVI-GRM) forms."}

Here, we advance this method in two complementary directions. First, we extend the method using a regularizer based on the total generalized variation (TGV) norm, in order to reconstruct a larger class of noise spectra, namely piecewise-linear noise spectra, which more realistically model many physical systems. We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra. These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy. Together, these developments broaden the reach of random pulse sequences for accurate and efficient noise characterization in realistic quantum systems."}

In this study, we employ the low-temperature bonding technique integral to hybrid bonding to fabricate SiO-SiO interfaces and investigate their thermal boundary conductance using time domain thermoreflectance. Structural characterizations show high quality bonded interfaces. By fitting the data with an equivalent multilayer thermal model, we establish a lower limit TBC of 150 MW/m2-K for the SiO-SiO interfaces, which corresponds to a thermal resistance lower than that of a 9.2-nm-thick dielectric layer. These findings offer valuable insights into thermal transport in hybrid-bonded structures and provide critical guidance for the thermal design of advanced packaging solutions."}

Since such rounds contribute, negatively, to the error correction leakage, this results in a correct, though sub-optimal bound.

Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems.

While single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are recognized for their gas adsorption capabilities, their integration with photonic structures often overlooks complex light-matter interactions. In this work, we report a counterintuitive polarization-dependent response in an evanescent-wave NO2 sensor, fabricated by depositing aerosol-synthesized SWCNT thin films onto SPFs. The device demonstrates high performance, including a limit of detection of 400 ppb and stable operation in humid environments. However, its sensing behavior deviates strikingly from established models: upon NO2 exposure, transmitted light intensity increases for TM polarization but decreases for TE polarization, a phenomenon not attributable solely to changes in the intrinsic absorption of the SWCNTs. We pinpoint that the dominant mechanism is a gas-induced alteration of the SWCNT film's complex refractive index, which subsequently perturbs the evanescent field mode profile of the waveguide. Numerical simulations confirm that accounting for this mode-profile redistribution is essential to accurately describe the sensor's response. Revealed mechanism provides an important design framework for advanced evanescent-field sensors based on tunable nanomaterial claddings."}

In particular, we find that the total energy flux radiated to infinity is maximized at a gravitational-wave frequency that is close to, but not exactly equal to, the real part of the corresponding quasinormal-mode frequency. Moreover, as the binary is moved farther away from the SMBH, this offset from the mode frequency becomes increasingly pronounced. In addition, for suitable orientations, the binary can effectively ``feed'' the light ring of the SMBH, selectively exciting particular oscillation modes. For rotating (Kerr) black holes, the mode spectrum is significantly more intricate; however, individual modes are also less strongly damped, leading to an enhanced - but more difficult to interpret - resonant response."}

In this paper, we investigate the multiparameter estimation for a uniformly accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a vacuum scalar field in both bounded and unbounded Minkowski vacuum. Our analysis reveals that quantum Cramér-Rao bound fails to provide a tight error bound for the two-parameter estimation involving the initial phase and weight parameters. For this reason, we numerically compute two tighter error bounds, Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, based on a semidefinite program. Notably, our results demonstrate that Nagaoka bound yields the tightest error bound among all the considered error bounds, consistent with the general hierarchy of multiparameter quantum estimation. In the case with a boundary, we observe the introduction of boundary systematically reduces the values of both Holevo Cramér-Rao bound and Nagaoka bound, indicating an improvement on the attainable estimation precision.

This result uncovers a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely the ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\" under relativistic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and systematic characterization of such a phenomenon within a relativistic framework.

The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical.

The entanglement entropy exhibits pronounced peaks and follows the logarithmic scaling law at the phase transition points, from which we extract the central charge $c=1$.

In this paper, we examine measurement using the Q-based, objective-field model for quantum mechanics. Schrodinger considered a microscopic system prepared in a superposition of states which is then coupled to a macroscopic meter. We analyze the entangled meter and system, and measurements on it, by solving forward-backward stochastic differential equations for real amplitudes $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ that correspond to the phase-space variables of the Q function of the system at a time $t$. We model the system and meter as single-mode fields, and measurement of $\\hat{x}$ by amplification of the amplitude $x(t)$. Our conclusion is that the outcome for the measurement is determined at (or by) the time $t_{m}$, when the coupling to the meter is complete, the meter states being macroscopically distinguishable. There is consistency with macroscopic realism. By evaluating the distribution of the amplitudes $x$ and $p$ postselected on a given outcome of the meter, we show how the $Q$-based model represents a more complete description of quantum mechanics: The variances associated with amplitudes $x$ and $p$ are too narrow to comply with the uncertainty principle, ruling out that the distribution represents a quantum state. We conclude that the collapse of the wavefunction occurs as a two-stage process: First there is an amplification that creates branches of amplitudes $x(t)$ of the meter, associated with distinct eigenvalues. The outcome of measurement is determined by $x(t)$ once amplified, explaining Born's rule. Second, the distribution that determines the final collapse is the state inferred for the system conditioned on the outcome of the meter: information is lost about the meter, in particular, about the complementary variable $p$."}

We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of \"gravitational bubbles\" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties."}

This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator.

In addition, these public classical steps also have information leakage which subjects QKD to additional attack strategies and reduces the final key rate. In this work, we propose a new QKD variant that removes the need for a separate authentication mechanism, eliminates information leakage, and achieves a substantially higher key rate.

This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $ρ^4$, which appears at order $α^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy.

Starting from a one-dimensional interaction $V(x) = -g^2 e^{-αm x}/x$, we reformulate the problem in terms of a four-dimensional radial oscillator, where the finite screening length generates a systematic hierarchy of polynomial interactions in the radial coordinate. This mapping enables a controlled Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbative treatment of the ground-state wavefunction and an explicit spectral analysis of the reduced density matrix. Working in the weak-screening regime, we compute the leading non-Gaussian correction arising from the quartic interaction $ρ^4$, which appears at order $α^2$ in the expansion of the Yukawa-like potential. We obtain closed analytic expressions for the resulting small eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix and evaluate their contribution to the von Neumann entanglement entropy. We show that the entropy receives analytic corrections at order $α^2$, originating both from explicit anharmonic state-mixing effects and from the implicit $α$ dependence of the Gaussian width parameter. Our results clarify the distinct roles of harmonic renormalization and genuinely non-Gaussian interactions in generating entanglement, establish a systematic power-counting and normalization scheme for higher-order $ρ^{2n}$ perturbations, and provide a transparent oscillator-based framework for computing entanglement entropy in weakly interacting low-dimensional and field-theoretic systems."}

Similarly, in a Bell test using any given Bell inequality, the maximum violation achievable using quantum strategies respecting or disregarding a certain symmetry can be different. In this work, we focus on the symmetry involved in the exchange of parties and explore when we have to trade this symmetry for a lower-dimensional quantum strategy in achieving the maximal violation of given Bell inequalities. For the family of symmetric Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequalities, we provide evidence showing that there is no such trade-off. However, for several other Bell inequalities with a small number of dichotomic measurement settings, we show that symmetric quantum strategies in the minimal Hilbert space dimension can only lead to a suboptimal Bell violation. In other words, there exist symmetric Bell inequalities that can only be maximally violated by asymmetric quantum strategies of minimal dimension. In contrast, one can also find examples of asymmetric Bell inequalities that are maximally violated by symmetric correlations. The implications of these findings on the geometry of the set of quantum correlations and the possibility of performing self-testing therefrom are briefly discussed."}

We clarify the connection of the frame adapted to constant-radius slices, to the Kodama vector and Misner-Sharp energy. Through frame transformations, we then show that the gravitational dynamics in a general foliation-adapted frame can be interpreted as hydrodynamics, i.e., geometro-hydrodynamics: the Einstein equations exhibit the gravitational analogs of the Euler and Young-Laplace equations, and the spacetime can be viewed as the worldvolume of a concentric stack of \"gravitational bubbles\" -- spherical collective modes with the Misner-Sharp energy density and a geometric pressure. We apply this framework to apparent horizons and study the dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar geometro-hydrodynamic picture holds in Lovelock gravity. These results provide a fresh perspective on this class of spacetimes and lay the foundation for understanding their thermodynamic properties."}

We clarify that the correct reading of the paradox requires making a clear distinction between two notions of causality violation: Newtonian action-at-a-distance and the quantum mechanical no-signalling; the latter is pertinent while the former is not.

We investigate whether improvements in stored energy and instantaneous charging power arise from genuine quantum correlations or from coherent collective dynamics that are not intrinsically quantum. We compare the time evolution of energetic quantities with a hierarchy of information-theoretic measures probing bipartite, tripartite, and further-partite correlations. Across different battery charger configurations, we find a consistent temporal ordering in which the instantaneous power peaks before the buildup of strong quantum correlations, indicating that peak charging is dominated by coherent transport, while entanglement and scrambling develop at later times. Furthermore, charging protocols based on k local interactions are examined under both unconstrained and norm-constrained (fair) settings, enabling a clear distinction between classical scaling effects and genuine collective enhancements. Increasing the interaction order or the participation number does not automatically translate into higher charging power. Instead, the performance is primarily dictated by how many particles actually become mutually correlated and contribute to entanglement. Fully collective interactions provide a genuine advantage because all particles participate coherently, whereas partially extended interaction schemes fail to monotonically increase the number of effectively interacting particles, and therefore do not guarantee improved charging efficiency."}

In fact, quantum computers can only be a viable alternative if their energy cost scales favorably, and some research has shown that there is even a potential quantum energy advantage. Rydberg atoms have emerged recently as one of the most promising platforms to implement a large-scale quantum computer, with significant advances made in recent years. This work aims at contributing first steps to understand the energy efficiency of this platform, namely by investigating the energy consumption of the different elements of a Rydberg atom quantum computer. First, an experimental implementation of the Quantum Phase Estimation algorithm is analyzed, and an estimation of the energetic cost of executing this algorithm is calculated. Then, a potential scaling of the energy cost of performing the Quantum Fourier Transform with Rydberg atoms is derived. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the energy consumption of different elements within a Rydberg atom quantum computer, from the preparation of the atoms to the execution of the algorithm, and the measurement of the final state, enabling the evaluation of the energy expenditure of the Rydberg platform and the identification of potential improvements.

Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components of target functions, mirroring the behavior observed in classical deep networks. We further analyze the impact of noise and show that, when single-qubit noise is applied after encoding-layer rotations and modeled as a Pauli channel aligned with the rotation axis, the Fourier component labeled by $\\boldsymbolω$ is suppressed by a factor $(1-2γ)^{\\|\\boldsymbolω\\|_1}$. This leads to exponential attenuation of high-frequency terms while preserving the learnability of low-frequency structure. In the same setting, we establish that the resulting noisy circuits admit efficient classical simulation up to average-case error. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: Quantum neural networks primarily learn low-frequency features during early optimization and maintain robustness against dephasing and depolarizing noise acting on the encoding layer. Our results provide a frequency-domain lens that unifies classical and quantum learning dynamics, clarifies the role of noise in shaping trainability, and guides the design of noise-resilient quantum neural networks."}

Here, we discuss the analogous statement and related questions for the \\emph{grand-canonical} density matrix $\\hatρ_\\mathrm{gc}=Z^{-1}_\\mathrm{gc} \\exp(-β(\\hat{H}^S-μ_1 \\hat{N}_{1}^S-\\ldots-μ_r\\hat{N}_{r}^S))$ with $\\hat{N}_{i}^S$ the number operator for molecules of type $i$ in the system $S$. This includes (i) the case of chemical reactions and (ii) that of systems $S$ defined by a spatial region which particles may enter or leave. It includes the statements (a) that the density matrix of the appropriate (generalized micro-canonical) Hilbert subspace $H_\\mathrm{gmc} \\subset H^S \\otimes H^B$ (defined by a micro-canonical interval of total energy and suitable particle number sectors), after tracing out $B$, yields $\\hatρ_\\mathrm{gc}$; (b) that typical $Ψ$ from $H_\\mathrm{gmc}$ have reduced density matrix $\\hatρ^S_Ψ$ close to $\\hatρ_\\mathrm{gc}$; and (c) that the conditional wave function $ψ^S$ of $S$ has probability distribution $\\mathrm{GAP}_{\\hatρ_\\mathrm{gc}}$ if a typical orthonormal basis of $H^B$ is used. That is, we discuss the foundation and justification of both the density matrix and the distribution of the wave function in the grand-canonical case. We also extend these considerations to the so-called generalized Gibbs ensembles, which apply to systems for which some macroscopic observables are conserved."}

Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena."}

Contrary to the widely held expectation that the Unruh effect inevitably degrades initially maximal entanglement, we demonstrate that the 1-3 bipartite entanglement of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly maximal for all accelerations, including the infinite-acceleration limit. This result uncovers a previously unexplored phenomenon, namely the ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\" under relativistic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first identification and systematic characterization of such a phenomenon within a relativistic framework. These findings overturn the conventional view that acceleration universally diminishes maximal entanglement and establish the $CL_4$ state as a promising resource for quantum information processing in non-inertial or curved-spacetime settings."}

To resolve the distribution of magic across different scales, we introduce a multipartite non-local magic functional, constructed from an inclusion-exclusion combination of subsystem contributions. This measure serves as a fine-grained diagnostic, isolating genuinely global contributions and revealing nontrivial interactions between local and collective supports of magic. We illustrate the measure on paradigmatic multipartite states and apply these diagnostics to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and its variants. Crucially, for thermal/typical ensembles, we observe a marked disparity between Thermal Pure Quantum (TPQ) states and the thermal density matrix. This reveals a concealed complexity: the immense computational hardness characterizing the unitary evolution is encoded in the specific microstructure of the black hole microstates, while being washed out in the coarse-grained thermodynamic description. Furthermore, in $\\mathcal N=2$ supersymmetric SYK, we show that while fortuitous BPS states exhibit intermediate stabilizer complexity, the multipartite measure unveils a rich, sector-dependent pattern of global correlations, distinguishing them from generic chaotic states."}

This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED."}

Here we streamline and generalize this theorem using the homotopy theory of H-groups, showing that for $k \\in \\{1,2,4\\}$, the non-torsion part of $π_1 \\mathrm{Map}\\big({(S^{2k-1})^2, S^{2k}}\\big)$ is an integer Heisenberg group of level 2, where we identify this level with 2 divided by the Hopf invariant of the generator of $π_{4k-1}(S^{2k})$.

We critically assess this consistency argument using scalar field models. We show that whether complementarity or no-signalling is violated when quantum fluctuations are neglected, depends on how this approximation is taken, while in both cases entanglement is generated locally in spacetime. We clarify that the correct reading of the paradox requires making a clear distinction between two notions of causality violation: Newtonian action-at-a-distance and the quantum mechanical no-signalling; the latter is pertinent while the former is not. We conclude that the thought experiment (a) does not add to the epistemological relevance of entanglement through Newtonian potentials (b) lends support for the existence of gravitons, if retardation effects are detected in entanglement through gravity."}
