### [2] [Probing Bandwidth and Sensitivity in Rydberg Atom Sensing via Optical Homodyne and RF Heterodyne Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20632)
*Dixith Manchaiah,Stone Oliver,Samuel Berweger,Christopher L. Holloway,Nikunjkumar Prajapati*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Rydberg atom-based sensors show promise for future communication and radar technologies due to their SI traceable measurements. The study investigates the bandwidth and sensitivity of a Rydberg-based sensor using EIT spectroscopy and RF heterodyne measurement. They achieve a 8 MHz bandwidth while preserving sensitivity. Additionally, the sensor is used to detect digital communication signals, and their performance is compared to a conventional RF mixer. The results highlight the dependence of bandwidth on symbol rate and signal type, with the Rydberg sensor showing reduced SNR and increased noise accumulation in modulated signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rydberg atom-based sensors are a promising technology for high-precision measurements in various applications, particularly in communication and radar systems. It is essential to understand their performance characteristics, such as bandwidth and sensitivity, to determine their suitability for these applications.

Method: The researchers investigate the bandwidth and sensitivity of a Rydberg-based sensor by employing EIT spectroscopy with an RF heterodyne measurement technique and optical homodyne detection. They measure the sensor's response bandwidth and analyze its performance in detecting digital communication signals while comparing it to a conventional RF mixer.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates that the Rydberg-based sensor achieves an 8 MHz bandwidth while maintaining sensitivity. They also show that the sensor's performance depends on the symbol rate and whether the signal is modulated or a pure tone. The digital communication signals are successfully detected, and their analysis using EVM measurements provides valuable insights into the sensor's operation in different scenarios.

Conclusion: Rydberg atom-based sensors offer a viable solution for high-precision measurements in communication and radar technologies. The findings of this study indicate that these sensors can be effectively used for applications requiring specific bandwidth and sensitivity requirements, with performance that adapts to different types of signals. Further research is needed to optimize their performance for practical applications.

Abstract: Rydberg atom based sensors allow for SI traceable measurements and show
promise for applications in the field of communication and radar technologies.
In this article, we investigate the bandwidth and sensitivity of a Rydberg
atom-based sensor in a rubidium vapor cell using Rydberg electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy. We employ a radio-frequency (RF)
heterodyne measurement technique in combination with an optical homodyne setup
to extend the achievable range between sensitivity and bandwidth in a Rydberg
sensor. While the bandwidth of Rydberg sensors are limited by the transit time
of atoms and the Rabi frequency of the coupling field, achieving higher
bandwidth through smaller beam sizes is thought to compromise sensitivity due
to reduced EIT signal strength. Using optical homodyne detection, we
demonstrate that sensitivity is preserved while achieving a response bandwidth
of 8 MHz. In addition, using the Rydberg sensor, we receive digital
communication signals and present error vector magnitude (EVM) measurements as
a function of varying symbol rates and bandwidth of the Rydberg sensor.
Furthermore, the sensor's performance is compared with a conventional RF mixer.
We establish that the bandwidth of a Rydberg sensor when receiving a pure tone
is not the same as the bandwidth of the sensor when receiving a modulated
signal. This difference results from the spreading of symbols in the frequency
domain, leading to a reduction of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and an
accumulation of noise over the total span of the modulated signal.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product
measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an
alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than
modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space
allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified
position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both
approaches and highlight their merits.

### [4] [Computational Relative Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20472)
*Johannes Jakob Meyer,Asad Raza,Jacopo Rizzo,Lorenzo Leone,Sofiene Jerbi,Jens Eisert*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces computational entropy measures in quantum information theory, focusing on scenarios with computational constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to extend information-theoretic frameworks to account for computational limitations, particularly in quantum systems.

Method: They define computational relative entropy and use it to establish analogues of key theorems in hypothesis testing and entropy theory.

Result: New computational entropy measures are developed, and their applications to entanglement theory are demonstrated.

Conclusion: Computational constraints significantly impact information measures, revealing new research directions in quantum information theory.

Abstract: Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our
disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or
communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For
computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can,
for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they
actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and
take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures
the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the
look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity,
we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in
asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and
quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this
foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish
computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and
demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally
indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a
computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression
rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our
quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational
version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between
computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical
gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that
computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic
landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum
information, complexity theory, and cryptography.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time
crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we
identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest
Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the
boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a
crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address
finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study
the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their
histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a
staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with
the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic
synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state
density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations
of the classical and quantum crossover differ, reflecting the noncommutativity
of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement,
quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.

*Éva Rácz,László Ruppert,Radim Filip*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于量子非高斯性 witness 的方法，利用光子数平均和方差来检测未知输入状态的量子参数，并能抵御噪声和失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了检测光量子信号的参数，尤其在 amplify 过程中如何处理噪声和失真，该研究寻求解决方法。

Method: 通过测量放大后集成强度的时刻来推断光子数平均和方差，基于这些来做统计分析并构造 witness。

Result: 该方法仅依赖于一阶和二阶矩，测量结果便于校正噪声和失真。

Conclusion: 提出了新的量子非高斯性检测方法，具有实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Amplification is an essential part of quantum processing and detection that
allows for reducing subsequent loss and noise. However, the intensive
amplification transfers individual discrete quanta to a detected continuous
signal, so Fock probabilities of the unknown input state are not readily
available. To solve this issue, we directly derive and analyze a quantum
non-Gaussianity witness based on the photon number mean and variance (or
alternatively, the second-order correlation $g^{(2)}$) of the unknown state,
which can be inferred from post-amplification integrated intensity moments.
Since this new witness is based on first and second moments only, measurement
results are easy to correct for losses and additive noise.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We address gauge invariance in the statistical mechanics of quantum many-body
systems. The gauge transformation acts on the position and momentum degrees of
freedom and it is represented by a quantum shifting superoperator that maps
quantum observables onto each other. The shifting superoperator is
anti-self-adjoint and it has noncommutative Lie algebra structure. These
properties induce exact equilibrium sum rules that connect locally-resolved
force and hyperforce densities for any given observable. We demonstrate the
integration of the framework within quantum hyperdensity functional theory and
show that it generalizes naturally to nonequilibrium.

Abstract: Robust execution environments are important for addressing key challenges in
quantum computing, such as application development, portability, and
reproducibility, and help unlock the development of modular quantum programs,
driving forward hybrid quantum workflows. In this work, we show progress
towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing
hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC)
environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware
includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in
order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for
observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing
multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens
in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum
Resource Management Interface (QRMI). Lastly, we discuss and show a solution
for the monitoring and observability stack, completing our description of the
hybrid system architecture.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce an entanglement distillation (purification) protocol for
supersinglet states composed of N qubits. The supersinglet state we target is a
total spin zero state with zero spin variance, and has a fully entangled
structure involving all qubits. In our distillation protocol, three copies of
an initial spin zero state are measured in the local total spin basis such that
a higher fidelity supersinglet state is generated upon postselection. The
initial state can be prepared using conventional Bell state distillation
methods distributed in a way to target the supersinglet symmetries. The
protocol uses only local operations and classical communications, and is
suitable for long-distance applications such as quantum clock synchronization
and cryptography, and avoids a high dimensional Schur transform such that it
can be used for tasks such as quantum metrology.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种统一的框架，扩展了量子纠错码的设计范围，提供了性能优于现有构造的新量子码。

Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and
logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant
spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state
spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms,
ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices
and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and
their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces.
We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$
codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain
new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with
the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial
patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This
improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present
explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total
spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes
with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance
larger than the known constructions.

Abstract: This paper investigates quantum dots (QDs), which are miniature semiconductor
structures with remarkable optical and electrical properties due to quantum
confinement processes. Traditional QDs, such as CdTe, have been extensively
investigated; however, they frequently exhibit toxicity and stability issues.
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are emerging as a safer and more stable
alternative to traditional QDs. GQDs are honeycomb-lattice carbon atoms with
unique electronic and optical properties that make them promising candidates
for biomedical, electronic, and energy storage applications. GQD synthesis
methods (top-down and bottom-up) and their advantages over standard QDs include
better photostability, biocompatibility, and configurable band gaps. GQDs are
perfect for real-world uses like sensitive biosensing, real-time food safety
monitoring, and smart packaging because of their low toxicity, high
sensitivity, and affordability. These uses are all essential for cutting down
on food grain waste. This emphasizes the growing significance of GQDs in

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the average information scrambling and nonlocal
magic generation properties of random Clifford encoding-decoding circuits
perturbed by local noise. We quantify these with the bipartite algebraic
out-of-time order correlator ($\mathcal{A}$-OTOC) and average Pauli-entangling
power (APEP) respectively. Using recent advances in the representation theory
of the Clifford group, we compute both quantities' averages in the limit that
the circuits become infinitely large. We observe that both display a
``butterfly effect" whereby noise occurring on finitely many qubits leads to
macroscopic information scrambling and nonlocal magic generating power.
Finally, we numerically study the relationship between the magic capacity, an
operator-level magic monotone, of the noise channel and the APEP of the
resulting circuit, which may provide insight for designing efficient nonlocal
magic factories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to
implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical
optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However,
the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum
chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz
initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs
a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state
space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA
applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes
grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose
Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum
algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD
recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be
orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term
appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost
function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in
the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find
good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary
evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a
variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.

*Satoshi Yoshida,Hironobu Yoshida,Mio Murao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper derives optimal asymptotic fidelities for estimating unknown 3-dimensional unitary operators with n queries and establishes a lower bound for general d-dimensional unitaries, utilizing the finite element method and a protocol from [J. Kahn, 2007].


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum metrology and the estimation of unitary operations are fundamental in quantum information science, with applications in quantum computing and sensing.

Method: Finite element analysis of the graph Laplacian was employed, based on quantum mechanics and linear algebra.

Result: For d=3, the optimal asymptotic fidelity is F_est(n, d=3) = 1 - (56π²)/(9n²) + O(n⁻³). For general d, the lower bound is F_est(n,d) ≥ 1 - (d+1)(d-1)(3d-2)(3d-1)/(6n²) + O(n⁻³).

Conclusion: The derived bounds represent the best known lower limits and exhibit optimal scaling with n and d, enhancing our understanding of quantum unitary estimation.

Abstract: Unitary estimation is the task to estimate an unknown unitary operator
$U\in\mathrm{SU}(d)$ with $n$ queries to the corresponding unitary operation,
and its accuracy is evaluated by an estimation fidelity. We show that the
optimal asymptotic fidelity of $3$-dimensional unitary estimation is given by
$F_\mathrm{est}(n,d=3) = 1-\frac{56\pi^2}{9n^2} + O(n^{-3})$ by the analysis of
the graph Laplacian based on the finite element method. We also show the lower
bound on the fidelity of $d$-dimensional unitary estimation for an arbitrary
$d$ given by $F_\mathrm{est}(n,d) \geq 1- \frac{(d+1)(d-1)(3d-2)(3d-1)}{6n^2} +
O(n^{-3})$ achieving the best known lower bound and tight scaling with respect
to $n$ and $d$. This lower bound is derived based on the unitary estimation
protocol shown in [J. Kahn, Phys. Rev. A 75, 022326, 2007].

Method: 该论文采用数学推导和理论分析的方法，通过分析不同相位对成功概率的影响来解决最优相位问题。

Result: 论文得出，在经典情况下，最佳相位变化为π，直到成功概率接近1之前保持不变；而当初始振幅为复数时，最佳相位变化取决于振幅的复杂度，通过优化公式可以确定最佳相位。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子搜索算法的优化提供了新的理论依据。

Abstract: We study the generalized Grover's algorithm with an arbitrary amplitude
vector to find the optimal phase change for maximizing the gain in probability
for the target of each iteration. In the classic setting of Grover's algorithm
with a real initial amplitude vector, we find that a phase change of $\pi$
stays optimal until the probability of observing the target is quite close to
1. We provide a formula for identifying this cut-off point based on the size of
the data set. When the amplitude is truly complex, we find that the optimal
phase change depends non-trivially on the complexity of the amplitude vector.
We provide an optimization formula to identify the required optimal phase
change.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but
the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era
computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates,

In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that

  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Hamiltonians from time evolution: given
the ability to apply $e^{-iHt}$ for an unknown Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits, the
goal is to recover the parameters of $H$. This is a well-studied problem in
quantum learning theory, with applications to quantum metrology, sensing,
device benchmarking, and many-body physics. For this problem, we demonstrate
the first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown
Hamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning
to error $\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \epsilon$ rounds of
interaction with the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed to
be $k$-local, we show that learning to constant error requires $n^{\Omega (k)}$
rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian, resolving an open question of Tang.
These bounds immediately imply that any learning algorithm with inverse
polynomial time resolution requires super-polynomial total evolution time. Our
lower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where
the goal is to detect the presence of a single coefficient which is
super-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian, as
well as for average case instances.

Abstract: Computational modeling of cellular systems, where reactants are governed by
biochemical equations and physical representations, requires extensive
classical computing resources. These limitations significantly constrain the
system size and spatiotemporal scales of simulations. A key challenge lies in
the "curse of dimensionality", where the number of possible reaction terms
grows exponentially with the number of species, and the computation of reaction
rates involving many-body interactions becomes intractable in polynomial time
on classical computers. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithmic
framework designed to overcome these challenges, leveraging the architecture of
quantum computing to simultaneously compute reaction rates and track the
spatiotemporal dynamical evolutions of subcellular systems. We generalize the
reaction-diffusion equation (RDE) for multiscale systems with arbitrary species
count, encompassing higher-order interactions. Our approach achieves two
principal quantum advantages: (i) an exponential quantum speedup in
reaction-rate computation, contingent on the efficient preparation of
polynomially accurate ground states on a quantum computer, and (ii)) a
quadratic scaling in spatial grid points and polynomial scaling in the number
of species for solving nonlinear RDEs, contrasting sharply with classical
methods that scale exponentially with the system's degrees of freedom. To our
knowledge, this represents the first efficient quantum algorithm for solving
multiscale reaction-diffusion systems. This framework opens the door to
simulations of biologically relevant subcellular processes across previously
inaccessible spatial and temporal scales, with profound implications for
computational biology, soft matter physics, and biophysical modeling.

Motivation: 研究随机量子正则编码的解码难度有助于理解现代量子计算中的潜在安全漏洞。

Method: 通过比较两种编码在不同参数下的行为，评估算法复杂性。

Result: 随机量子正则编码在至少一个逻辑体有效率时的解码难度不低于传统编码在恒定速率下的难度，这对密码学有重要意义。

Conclusion: 理解随机量子编码和经典编码的解码难度有助于推动前端技术和应用的发展。

Abstract: Random classical linear codes are widely believed to be hard to decode. While
slightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes
sufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential
time. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code
has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in
our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus
random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with
even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical
code at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the
easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest
random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm
decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a
breakthrough in cryptography.
  More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic
properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random
self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random
self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on
Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent
interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other
self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and
decision. We also demonstrate several ways in which quantum phenomena, such as
quantum degeneracy, force several reasonable definitions of stabilizer
decoding--all of which are classically identical--to have distinct or
non-trivially equivalent complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are crucial for near-term quantum devices, but the no-cloning theorem hinders traditional backpropagation, high resource costs, and scalability.

Method: We reformulate training dynamics as a nonlinear PDE and use physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this system efficiently, enabling accurate parameter updates with limited data.

Result: The method achieves up to a 30x speedup over conventional methods, reduces quantum resource costs by 90% for tasks with up to 40 qubits, and maintains competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: This protocol significantly enhances the efficiency of VQAs, making them more practical for large-scale quantum applications.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach
practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning
theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to
prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To
address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a
nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that
leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical
system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected
from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over
multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum
resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and
reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40
qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques
aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their
potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Anharmonic potential quantum system play crucial role in physics as they
provide a more realistic description of oscillatory phenomena, which often
deviate from the idealized harmonic model. However, simulating such system on
classical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large
state spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational
resources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum
anharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's
Quantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and
Toffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key
phenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit
system to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational
Quantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies.
The proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11%
compared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations
such as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
(WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These
results highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective
tools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future
application in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware
continues to advance.

Motivation: 随着量子通信的发展，实际通信信道中通常存在散斑等干扰因素，传统的Bell不等式检验需要明确的测量基选择，这在实际应用中 encounters困难。因此，寻找一种不依赖测量基选择的Bell检验方法变得有意义。

Method: 在实验中，利用一 photons 的纠缠态，将其置入含有散斑的多模光纤（通用车模），令其散斑模式自然产生。同时，另一 photons 保持在发送端。通过空间分辨率重叠散斑强度模式，获得大量随机且未知的polarization投影。统计这些数据集，满足统计上为Bell不等式悖论现象所需的条件，因此可以进行Bell检验。

Result: 该方法成功在实验中利用散斑作为资源进行Bell检验，无需主动调整测量基，从而无需已知测量基的纠缠态检验。这表明散斑可以作为一种有效的资源用来验证纠缠性。

Conclusion: 该方法为即使在存在散斑和其他干扰因素的现实量子通信信道中进行Bell检验提供了一个可行且实用的解决方案。它去除了传统Bell检验中需显式的测量基选择限制。因此，这为实际应用中无需校准的纠缠态检验开辟了新的途径。

Abstract: Bell inequalities are a cornerstone of quantum physics. By carefully
selecting measurement bases (typically polarization), their violation certifies
quantum entanglement. Such measurements are disrupted by the presence of
optical disorder in propagation paths, including polarization or spatial mode
mixing in fibers and through free-space turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that
disorder can instead be exploited as a resource to certify entanglement via a
Bell inequality test. In our experiment, one photon of a polarization-entangled
pair propagates through a commercial multimode fiber that scrambles spatial and
polarization modes, producing a speckle pattern, while the other photon remains
with the sender. By spatially resolving the speckle intensity pattern, we
naturally access a large set of random and unknown polarization projections. We
show that this set is statistically sufficient to violate a Bell inequality,
thereby certifying entanglement without requiring active correction techniques.
Our approach provides a fundamentally new way to test Bell inequalities,
eliminating the need for an explicit choice of measurement basis, and offering
a practical solution for entanglement certification in real-world quantum
communication channels where disorder is unavoidable.

Abstract: We prove that the linearity and positivity of quantum mechanics impose
general restrictions on quantum purification, unveiling a new fundamental
limitation of quantum information processing. In particular, no quantum
operation can transform a finite number of copies of an unknown quantum state
or channel into a pure state or channel that depends on the input, thereby
ruling out an important form of universal purification in both static and
dynamical settings. Relaxing the requirement of exact pure output, we further
extend our result to establish quantitative sample complexity bounds for
approximate purification, independent of any task details or operational
constraints. To illustrate the practical consequences of this principle, we
examine the task of approximately preparing pure dilation and, for the first
time, prove an exponential lower bound on the required sample complexity.

Abstract: We study the limitations of black-box amplification in the quantum complexity
class QMA. Amplification is known to boost any inverse-polynomial gap between
completeness and soundness to exponentially small error, and a recent result
(Jeffery and Witteveen, 2025) shows that completeness can in fact be amplified
to be doubly exponentially close to 1. We prove that this is optimal for
black-box procedures: we provide a quantum oracle relative to which no QMA
verification procedure using polynomial resources can achieve completeness
closer to 1 than doubly exponential, or a soundness which is
super-exponentially small. This is proven by using techniques from complex
approximation theory, to make the oracle separation from (Aaronson, 2008),
between QMA and QMA with perfect completeness, quantitative.

TL;DR: Vortex electrons with OAM in a magnetic field exhibit oscillatory behavior described by NSLG states, and while they emit radiation, both the power and angular momentum losses are negligible, making linear accelerators suitable for maintaining Electron vorticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of relativistic vortex electrons in magnetic fields is crucial for applications in accelerator physics, particularly in maintaining their quantum properties and angular momentum.

Method: The authors solve Maxwell's equations with charge and current densities from NSLG states to compute radiated power and angular momentum losses.

Result: Calculations show negligible radiation effects, indicating linear accelerators are effective tools for maintaining Electron vorticity.

Conclusion: Linear accelerators (linacs) serve as a prominent method for preserving the vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles under quasi-classical conditions.

Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a
magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary
Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A
key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's
root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations.
Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit
photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM,
leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve
Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an
electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the
angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex
electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic
field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be
negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a
prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and
other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.

Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a key step in quantum information, both
theoretically and practically. It has been proven that non-positive-partial
transpose (NPT) entangled states of rank at most four is 1-distillable under
local operation and classical communications. In this paper we investigate the
distillation of a more complex family of NPT entangled states, namely a family
of symmetric two-qutrit states $\r$ of rank five with given eigenvectors. We
explicitly construct five families of such states by requiring four of the five
eigenvalues to be the same. We respectively show that some of them are
1-distillable. It turns out that such states may be not 1-distillable for some
interval of eigenvalues. We provide some conditions for eigenvalues that allow
$\r$ to be 1-distillable or to be 1-undistillable.

Conclusion: 为受限计算环境下的量子态区分量度和资源提供了理论框架。) 

Abstract: Quantum information processing is limited, in practice, to efficiently
implementable operations. This motivates the study of quantum divergences that
preserve their operational meaning while faithfully capturing these
computational constraints. Using geometric, computational, and information
theoretic tools, we define two new types of computational divergences, which we
term computational max-divergence and computational measured R\'enyi
divergences. Both are constrained by a family of efficient binary measurements,
and thus useful for state discrimination tasks in the computational setting. We
prove that, in the infinite-order limit, the computational measured R\'enyi
divergence coincides with the computational max-divergence, mirroring the
corresponding relation in the unconstrained information-theoretic setting. For
the many-copy regime, we introduce regularized versions and establish a
one-sided computational Stein bound on achievable hypothesis-testing exponents
under efficient measurements, giving the regularized computational measured
relative entropy an operational meaning. We further define resource measures
induced by our computational divergences and prove an asymptotic continuity
bound for the computational measured relative entropy of resource. Focusing on
entanglement, we relate our results to previously proposed computational
entanglement measures and provide explicit separations from the
information-theoretic setting. Together, these results provide a principled,
cohesive approach towards state discrimination tasks and resource
quantification under computational constraints.

Abstract: Judging by its omnipresence in the literature, the hysteresis observed in the
transfer characteristics of emerging transistors based on 2D-materials is
widely accepted as an important metric related to the device quality. The
hysteresis is often reported with attributes like "negligible" or "small"
without giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what
reference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there
appears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually
contributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on
various experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first
providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms
contributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the
gate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue
by suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena.
Based on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis
values have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under
arbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a
standardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a
comparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized
scheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across
different technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate
data obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide
thicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel
combinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of
material systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs.

Abstract: Discrete time quasicrystals (DTQC) constitute a class of non-equilibrium
matter characterized by temporal order without strict periodicity, in contrast
to conventional time crystals. Investigating these phenomena is essential for
expanding our fundamental understanding of far-from-equilibrium quantum matter
and spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond periodic regimes. Here, we
experimentally observe a DTQC in a driven-dissipative ensemble of strongly
interacting Rydberg atoms, displaying non-equilibrium dynamical response with a
different finite Abelian group symmetry $\mathbb{Z}{_m} \times \mathbb{Z}{_n}$.
By applying a quasi-periodic drive using a dual-frequency drive with
incommensurate frequencies, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a robust
subharmonic response at multiple incommensurate frequencies, signifying the
emergence of a DTQC phase. We map the full phase diagram of the system, which
includes the DTQC phase, and demonstrated its rigidity against perturbations in
both RF field intensity and laser detuning. Moreover, we observe a cyclic group
symmetry effect that constrains the construction of $\mathbb{Z}{_2} \times
\mathbb{Z}{_3}$-symmetric DTQC. This work establishes a versatile platform for
studying non-equilibrium phases of matter and provides insights into the
dynamics of time-translation symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems.

Motivation: Understanding the turbulence behavior in quantum systems and the role of non-thermal fixed points is important for both theoretical physics and potential applications in related fields.

Method: The study likely involves theoretical analysis, possibly numerical simulations, and experimental observations to analyze the dynamics of the superfluid's turbulence.

Result: The turbulence exhibits scaling characteristics similar to classical turbulence, with specific scaling exponents observed in the velocity circulation moments.

Conclusion: This links the decaying quantum turbulence in the closed system to universal dynamics near a non-thermal fixed point, suggesting a new framework for understanding such systems.

Abstract: Anomalously slow coarsening in a dilute two-dimensional (2d) superfluid --
associated with a non-thermal fixed point in the closed system's universal
dynamics and driven by three-vortex collisions which initiate vortex-pair
annihilations -- is found to exhibit spatial scaling characteristics of
Kraichnan-Kolmogorov turbulence. During a universal interval, when the
characteristic length scale related to the inter-defect distance grows as
$\ell_\text{v}\sim t^{\,\beta}$, with $\beta\approx1/5$, moments of the
superfluid velocity circulation around an area of extent $r$ scale as predicted
by classical turbulence theory, $\Gamma^{p}(r)\sim r^{4p/3}$. Intermittency
corrections seen for higher values of $p$ are found to be consistent with
values measured for fully developed, classical turbulence. Hence, we link the
decaying quantum turbulence cascade in a closed superfluid to universal
dynamics close to a non-thermal fixed point. The decay exponent $\beta$ clearly
deviates from values known for classical systems.

efficiency are effectively limiting the scalability. We present a comb-driven
coherent optical transmitter architecture on a Si/SiN platform that provides
the bandwidth density, energy efficiency, and compact footprint required for
such co-packaged-enabled optical interconnects. We evaluate scalability through
critical building blocks, including ultra-compact microring-assisted
Mach--Zehnder modulators (MRA-MZMs) and dense wavelength-division multiplexing
(DWDM) interleavers. Single-tone experiments demonstrate a net line rate of 400
Gbps per polarization (16-QAM, 120 GBd) in silicon within the O-band, achieving
a record shoreline density of 4 Tbps/mm while consuming only 10 fJ/bit for
modulation. We also demonstrate transmission rates of up to 160 GBd QPSK in
back-to-back and 100 GBd over 7 km of fiber without dispersion compensation.
Using a quantum-dot frequency comb, six 100 GHz-spaced WDM channels transmit
1.08 Tbps over 5 km. System-level analyses show that by leveraging advanced
modulation formats through the integration of wavelength and polarization
multiplexing, our proposed architecture can realistically support combined
transmission rates exceeding 10 Tbps per fiber within practical limits of power
consumption and packaging, outlining a clear path toward future petabit-scale
interconnects.

Abstract: In the design of optical devices and components, geometric structures and
optical properties of materials, such as absorption, refraction, reflection,
diffraction, scattering, and trapping, have been utilized. Finding the ideal
material with certain optical and geometric characteristics is essential for a
customized application. Here, we fabricated unoxidizable achromatic copper
films (ACFs) on Al2O3 substrates utilizing an atomic sputtering epitaxy
apparatus. ACFs are made up of two regions vertically: a comparatively flat
layer region and a three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructured region on top
of the flat region. The measured specular reflectance displayed low-pass filter
behaviour with a sharp cutoff frequency in the infrared spectrum. Furthermore,
the measured diffusive reflectance spectra showed light-trapping behaviour in
the spectral region above the cutoff frequency, where there are no known
absorption mechanisms, such as phonons and interband transitions. A focused ion
beam scanning electron microscope was utilized to study the thin film's
nanostructured region through 3D tomographic analysis in order to comprehend
the phenomena that were observed. This work will shed fresh light on the design
and optimization of optical filters and light-trapping employing porous
nanostructured metallic thin films.

Abstract: In-line holography offers high space-bandwidth product imaging with a
simplified lens-free optical system. However, in-line holographic
reconstruction is troubled by twin images arising from the Hermitian symmetry
of complex fields. Twin images disrupt the reconstruction in solving the
ill-posed phase retrieval problem. The known parameters are less than the
unknown parameters, causing phase ambiguities. State-of-the-art deep-learning
or non-learning methods face challenges in balancing data fidelity with
twin-image disturbance. We propose the Gaussian splatting holography (GSH) for
twin-image-suppressed holographic reconstruction. GSH uses Gaussian splatting
for optical field representation and compresses the number of unknown
parameters by a maximum of 15 folds, transforming the original ill-posed phase
retrieval into a well-posed one with reduced phase ambiguities. Additionally,
the Gaussian splatting tends to form sharp patterns rather than those with
noisy twin-image backgrounds as each Gaussian has a spatially slow-varying
profile. Experiments show that GSH achieves constraint-free recovery for
in-line holography with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, with an average peak signal-to-noise ratio equal to
26 dB, and structure similarity equal to 0.8. Combined with total variation,
GSH can be further improved, obtaining a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 31 dB,
and a high compression ability of up to 15 folds.

Abstract: Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a widely used high-throughput fabrication
technique for photonic devices, yet its reliability is often compromised by the
inevitable imperfections that arise during the demolding process. Topological
photonics, which harnesses topologically nontrivial structures to support
defect-robust photonic states, offers a promising solution to this challenge.
Here, we demonstrate a topological laser that is one-step nanoimprinted upon
colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. This laser features multiple higher-order
topological corner states, with topological protection provided by the
structure effectively mitigating imperfections caused by the nanoimprinting
process. This property enables the reliable detection of these states, which is
particularly challenging to achieve in the visible spectrum. Our work
establishes topological photonics as a viable pathway to enhance the
reliability of NIL-based manufacturing, providing a scalable and practical
route for mass-producing topological lasers with low-index materials.

Motivation: Understanding how strain affects edge states in graphene could lead to insights in topological materials and device applications.

Method: Experiments in specific graphene flake structures with various edges demonstrate edge state creation/dest(ap)ility.

Result: Realization of topological edge states and their depend(ents on boundary conditions and strain; possible higher-order topological insulatorrealization.

Conclusion: Strain enables control of edge states in graphene, opening potential for advanced materialss and devices within topological states framework.

Abstract: Strain has been extensively employed to tailor graphene's properties and has
emerged as a powerful tool for engineering gauge fields and exploring
fundamental phenomena in artificial platforms like photonic graphene. Here we
discover that, in graphene flakes with custom boundaries, one can create or
destroy edge states depending on the direction of the applied uniaxial strain.
This is experimentally demonstrated in a photonic platform with two specific
examples: one flake structure with pairs of twig and zigzag edges, and the
other with pairs of armchair and bearded edges. We find that the existence of
the edge states and their positions in momentum space are accurately predicted
with appropriate winding numbers, unveiling the underlying topology of such
edge states. Furthermore, when a graphene flake supports the maximum number of
edge states along boundaries after a semimetal-to-insulator transition, both
compact localized edge and corner states emerge, indicating the realization of
a photonic minimal-model higher-order topological insulator based on such
strained graphene flakes.

Abstract: Harnessing bound states in the continuum (BICs) for guiding light in leaky
environments has unlocked new possibilities in photonic integrated circuits.
BIC confinement enables low-loss waveguiding of leaky transverse-magnetic (TM)
modes in etchless waveguides based on dielectric wires loaded on plane slabs.
We have recently reported BIC slow light waveguides by introducing
one-dimensional photonic crystals into such etchless waveguides. However, they
were restricted to a high-symmetry point ($X$ point), limiting their
applicability. In this Letter, we propose and numerically demonstrate BIC slow
light waveguides at off-high-symmetry points by exploiting Friedrich-Wintgen
BICs, arising from the interband coupling of two guided modes sharing a
radiation continuum. We identified a systematic approach for tuning the loss
minimum position in momentum space and simultaneously achieved a high group
index over $100$ and a low propagation loss of less than $5 \times
10^{-2}~\mathrm{dB/cm}$ at an off-high-symmetry point. Our findings pave the
way for advanced control of light-matter interactions in non-Hermitian photonic
systems.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and scale of photonic and electromagnetic devices
demand efficient and accurate numerical solvers. In this work, we develop a
parallel overlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) based on the
finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) formulation to model the

employed to accelerate the iterative solution process, while an OpenMP-based
parallel implementation ensures high scalability. Several numerical examples

Conclusion: VIE方法为加速下一代光子元器件设计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Designing nanophotonic devices with minimal human intervention has gained
substantial attention due to the complexity and precision required in modern
optical technologies. While inverse design techniques typically rely on
conventional electromagnetic solvers as forward models within optimization
routines, the substantial electrical size and subwavelength characteristics of
nanophotonic structures necessitate significantly accelerated simulation
methods. In this work, we introduce a forward modeling approach based on the
volume integral equation (VIE) formulation as an efficient alternative to
traditional finite-difference (FD)-based methods. We derive the adjoint method
tailored specifically for the VIE framework to efficiently compute optimization
gradients and present a novel unidirectional mode excitation strategy
compatible with VIE solvers. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that our
VIE-based approach provides multiple orders of magnitude improvement in
computational efficiency over conventional FD methods in both time and
frequency domains. To validate the practical utility of our approach, we
successfully designed two representative nanophotonic components: a selective
mode reflector and a 3 dB power splitter. Our results underscore the
significant runtime advantages offered by the VIE-based framework, highlighting
its promising role in accelerating inverse design workflows for next-generation
nanophotonic devices.

Abstract: The practical deployment of high-capacity free-space optical communication is
fundamentally limited by atmospheric turbulence, a challenge that conventional
mode-sorting techniques have failed to overcome. While engineered optical
computers like diffractive networks offer a potential solution, their design
complexity remains a significant barrier. Here, we introduce and experimentally
validate a methodology for task-dependent hardware design, demonstrating a
simple, continuous-wave-driven multimode fibre reservoir that is physically
configured to solve this specific, high-impact problem. We first establish a
set of physical design principles, showing that recurrent dynamics are optimal
for structural data (MNIST), whereas high mode-mixing is superior for textural
data (FMNIST). By treating turbulence-induced wavefront distortion as a complex
textural feature, we configure a physically optimised reservoir for classifying
orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes. In moderate to high-turbulence regimes,
our system outperforms an ideal modal decomposition by an average of
20.32~$\pm$~3.00\%, succeeding precisely where the conventional approach fails.
This work not only demonstrates a practical, low-complexity solution for
turbulence mitigation but also reframes the optical receiver as a physical
likelihood processor, thereby offering a path towards significantly reduced
digital signal processing burdens by offloading much of the computational load
to the physical optical front-end. We establish a framework for co-designing
physical hardware with computation, enabling simpler, more robust optical
machine learning systems tailored for real-world challenges.

*Feng Wang,Chunhui Yang,Xinyi Cui,Lixin He,Tianxin Ou,Rui-Bo Jin,Qing Liao,Pengfei Lan,Peixiang Lu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that using squeezed light in high-order harmonic generation (HHG) can control the long and short quantum paths, enabling ultrashort attosecond pulses for applications in attosecond metrology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attosecond metrology is a rapidly advancing field that requires precise and ultrafast measurement tools. High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a promising tabletop source for attosecond pulse generation, but controlling its quantum paths to achieve isolated pulses is a significant challenge. This paper addresses that challenge by introducing squeezed light as a means to control quantum paths in HHG.

Method: The researchers used theoretical modeling and experiments with both coherent and squeezed laser fields. They derived the intensity-dependent amplitudes and phases of the harmonic pulses. The experiments used characterization techniques including pulse spectroscopy and timing analysis.

Result: The study shows that squeezing the lasers monitored the quantum interference of electrons, leading to suppression of one quantum path and suppression of the other for extended harmonic plateaus. The single-photon interference patterns in attosecond pulses from HHG were successfully enabled at up to 800 nm wavelength. The suppression of one quantum path over an extended plateau opens new avenues for detailed quantitative modeling of individual harmonic orders and for ultrafast pulse engineering.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new level of control over the quantum paths in HHG, which is a major breakthrough in attosecond metrology. The ability to compare quantum states of light and their interference opens new possibilities for isolated attosecond pulse generation and ultrafast time-resolved studies.

Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG), a robust tabletop source for producing
attosecond pulses, has been extensively utilized in attosecond metrology.
Traditionally, HHG driven by classical laser fields involves two typical
quantum paths (short and long quantum paths) contributing to harmonic emission.
Here, we demonstrate that these quantum paths in HHG can be selectively
controlled using squeezed lights, a form of non-classical light. Our results
indicate that the long (short) quantum path of HHG will be dramatically
suppressed in the phase (amplitude)-squeezed fields. The time-frequency
analysis reveals that this quantum path control stems from the quantum
fluctuations in the squeezed light, which modify the phase matching of harmonic
emission from different quantum states of the squeezed light. Such a quantum
path selection can be achieved for the whole harmonic plateau, which has great
potential to generate ultrashort isolated attosecond pulse with duration less
than one atomic unit of time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore topological laser systems with potential applications in optical communication and metrology.

Method: Theoretical investigation of a system with time-reversal symmetry, using saturable gain and Kerr non-linearity in ring resonators with asymmetric waveguides.

Result: The system exhibits robust single-mode lasing under realistic conditions.

Conclusion:  newArray resonators display promising properties for spin-Hall lasers with high efficiency and resilience to scattering.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a quantum spin-Hall topological laser formed by
an array of dielectric ring resonators endowed of saturable gain. The system
preserves time-reversal symmetry, the clockwise and counter-clockwise modes in
each ring resonator acting as two pseudospin states that experience opposite
synthetic magnetic fields. We consider ring resonators featuring an internal
S-shaped waveguide asymmetrically coupling the two pseudospin states. In spite
of the non-magnetic nature of the configuration, we show that an effective
breaking of reciprocity is induced by the interplay of spatial parity breaking
with saturable gain and a Kerr optical non-linearity. This enables robust
single-mode topological lasing even in the presence of realistic levels of
backscattering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work is to enhance the stability and tunability of continuous wave optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) through the implementation of backward quasi-phase matching in a semi-monolithic cavity.

Method: The researchers constructed a doubly resonant semi-monolithic cavity with backward quasi-phase matching under continuous wave pumping. They systematically varied the pump wavelength and crystal temperature to measure the tuning capabilities of the system.

Result: The results reveal that by adjusting the pump wavelength, the forward and backward waves exhibit distinct tuning ranges of 56.85 nm and 0.89 nm, respectively. Furthermore, tuning the crystal temperature allows for stability in the operation of the BOPO over an even smaller range of ±59.4 GHz for both forward and backward waves.

Conclusion: This study confirms the feasibility of using a BOPO configuration in continuous wave pumped OPOs, highlighting its potential for applications requiring high stability and tunability.

Abstract: Doubly resonant optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) under continuous wave
(CW) pumping are particularly notable for their low threshold and narrow
linewidth. Backward OPOs (BOPOs) realized through backward quasi-phase matching
which exhibit unique tuning properties compared with conventional forward OPOs
have been demonstrated under pulse pumping. In this work, a doubly resonant
BOPO was implemented in a semi-monolithic cavity under CW pumping, and its
tuning properties were characterized. By tuning the pump wavelength, the
forward and backward waves exhibited tuning ranges of 56.85 nm and 0.89 nm,
respectively. Adjusting the crystal temperature resulted in tuning ranges of
59.7 GHz and 59.4 GHz for the forward and backward waves, respectively. This
research establishes the BOPO as a promising candidate for applications in the

offers advantages, the small crystal aperture (typically 1 mm$\times$3 mm)
limits resolution. Non-poled crystals enable larger apertures but suffer
walk-off aberrations. This work overcomes these limitations by using a
noncritical phase matched (NCPM) KTiOPO$_4$ crystal (6 mm$\times$7 mm aperture,
0.5 mm length). Results show resolutions 6$\times$ and 2$\times$ higher than
periodically poled crystals in orthogonal directions, with broad conversion
band (1.3-2.2 $\mu$m) covering biological and atmospheric windows. The absence
of walk-off ensures better image fidelity in up-conversion process. This study
presents the first comprehensive characterization of NCPM-based broadband
up-conversion imaging, demonstrating performance at the theoretical resolution
limit while circumventing drawbacks inherent in alternative up-conversion
schemes and conventional detectors.

Abstract: Selective control over the emission pattern of valley-polarized excitons in
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for developing novel
valleytronic, quantum information, and optoelectronic devices. While
significant progress has been made in directionally routing photoluminescence
from these materials, key challenges remain: notably, how to link routing
effects to the degree of valley polarization, and how to distinguish genuine
valley-dependent routing from spin-momentum coupling - an optical phenomenon
related to electromagnetic scattering but not the light source itself. In this
study, we address these challenges by experimentally and numerically
establishing a direct relationship between the intrinsic valley polarization of
the emitters and the farfield emission pattern, enabling an accurate assessment
of valley-selective emission routing. We report valley-selective manipulation
of the angular emission pattern of monolayer tungsten diselenide mediated by
gold nanobar dimer antennas at cryogenic temperature. Experimentally, we study
changes in the system's emission pattern for different circular polarization
states of the excitation, demonstrating a valley-selective circular dichroism
in photoluminescence of 6%. These experimental findings are supported by a
novel numerical approach based on the principle of reciprocity, which allows
modeling valley-selective emission in periodic systems. We further show
numerically, that these valley-selective directional effects are a
symmetry-protected property of the nanoantenna array owing to its extrinsic
chirality for oblique emission angles, and can significantly be enhanced when
tailoring the distribution of emitters. This renders our nanoantenna-based
system a robust platform for valleytronic processing.

TL;DR: Immersed reflection gratings using sub-wavelength structures improve spectral resolving power, efficiency, and reduce polarization sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the performance of grating spectrometers by modifying the design of immersed gratings.

Method: The authors developed a method using sub-wavelength structures and optimized using a modified CMA-ES algorithm.

Result: The new metagrating achieves 78% efficiency compared to 62% for conventional gratings, with reduced polarization sensitivity from 15% to 5%. manufactured tolerances degrade efficiency by up to 10% at ±25nm feature errors.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising alternative for more efficient and robust grating spectrometers.

Abstract: Immersed reflection gratings improve spectral resolving power by enabling
diffraction within a high refractive index medium. This principle has been
widely adopted to make grating spectrometers more compact. Conventional
immersed gratings have blazed profiles which typically show the highest
efficiency for one main design wavelength. In addition, the blazed profiles
tend to cause significant polarization sensitivity. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach for designing an immersed grating composed of
sub-wavelength structures, designed to increase diffraction efficiency and
reduce polarization dependence. For a theoretical demonstration, a reflective
metagrating immersed in silicon is optimized over the short-wave infrared
band-3 (SWIR-3, here $2.304~\mu$m-$2.405~\mu$m), targeting the same diffraction
angles as the immersion grating used in the Sentinel-5 Earth observation
mission. The structure is optimized using a modified Covariance Matrix
Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). The optimized immersed metagrating
achieves an average efficiency of (over the SWIR-3 band) $\sim 78\%$, compared
to $\sim 62\%$ for the conventional immersed blazed grating, and reduces
polarization sensitivity from roughly $\sim 15\%$ to $\sim 5\%$. A
manufacturing tolerance analysis is also conducted to evaluate the design's
performance under systematic manufacturing errors, which revealed a degradation
of $\sim 10\%$ efficiency at feature size errors of $\pm 25{nm}$ and almost
negligible effect on the efficiency at $-10{nm}$ and of $\sim 5\%$ at
$+10{nm}$.

Abstract: Nanophotonics has recently gained new momentum with the emergence of a novel
class of nanophotonic systems consisting of resonant dielectric nanostructures
integrated with single or few layers of transition metal dichalcogenides
(2D-TMDs). Thinned to the single layer phase, 2D-TMDs are unique solid-state
systems with excitonic states able to persist at room temperature and
demonstrate notable tunability of their energies in the optical range. Based on
these properties, they offer important opportunities for hybrid nanophotonic
systems where a nanophotonic structure serves to enhance the light-matter
interaction in the 2D-TMDs, while the 2D-TMDs can provide various active
functionalities, thereby dramatically enhancing the scope of nanophotonic
structures. In this work, we combine 2D-TMD materials with resonant photonic
nanostructures, namely, metasurfaces composed of high-index dielectric
nanoparticles. The dependence of the excitonic states on charge carrier density
in 2D-TMDs leads to an amplitude modulation of the corresponding optical
transitions upon changes of the Fermi level, and thereby to changes of the
coupling strength between the 2D-TMDs and resonant modes of the photonic
nanostructure. We experimentally implement such a hybrid nanophotonic system
and demonstrate voltage tuning of its reflectance as well as its different
polarization-dependent behavior. Our results show that hybridization with
2D-TMDs can serve to render resonant photonic nanostructures tunable and
time-variant $-$ important properties for practical applications in optical
analog computers and neuromorphic circuits.

Abstract: In quantum physics, classical optics, and many other wave systems, wave
confinement in a potential well produces is associated with discrete
oscillatory states, and the ground state is typically assumed to vanish
uniformly. An open question is whether the ground state can counterintuitively
support a flat-top, nonzero envelope, offering new opportunities for quantum
emitters, optical antennas, and lasers. Here, we show that by applying the
Byers-Yang theorem with an artificial gauge field, energy levels can be
continuously shifted, driving eigenstates to morph into a ground state with a
uniform yet nontrivial wave envelope. We implement this concept in a photonic
crystal slab where a central bulk region is surrounded by heterogeneous
bandgaps that engineer reflective phases acting as an artificial local gauge
field. By inducing lasing, we probe directly the evolution of the energy
levels, demonstrating wave morphing toward a flat-top ground state via near-
and far-field measurements.

Conclusion: 非互惠耦合为调控复杂振子网络的时空动力学行为提供了一种通用机制。

Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions fundamentally alter the collective dynamics of
nonlinear oscillator networks. Here we investigate Stuart-Landau oscillators on
a ring with nonreciprocal reactive or dissipative couplings combined with
Kerr-type or dissipative nonlinearities. Through numerical simulations and
linear analysis, we uncover two distinct and universal pathways by which
enhanced nonreciprocity drives spatiotemporal chaos. Nonreciprocal reactive
coupling with Kerr-type nonlinearity amplifies instabilities through
growth-rate variations, while nonreciprocal dissipative coupling with Kerr-type
nonlinearity broadens eigenfrequency distributions and destroys coherence,
which, upon nonlinear saturation, evolve into fully developed chaos. In
contrast, dissipative nonlinearities universally suppress chaos, enforcing
bounded periodic states. Our findings establish a minimal yet general framework
that goes beyond case-specific models and demonstrate that nonreciprocity
provides a universal organizing principle for the onset and control of
spatiotemporal chaos in oscillator networks and related complex systems.

### [54] [A relativistic coupled-cluster treatment of magnetic hyperfine structure of the $X^2Π$ and $A^2Σ^+$ states of OH isotopologues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20522)

TL;DR: Ab initio calculations of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure (HFS) constant for hydroxyl radical isotopologues have been performed using a four-component relativistic coupled-cluster method with triple excitations. The results provide highly accurate theoretical predictions that agree well with experimental values, offering a robust foundation for studying rovibrational levels in both adiabatic and non-adiabatic frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying the hyperfine structure of hydroxyl radical isotopologues is important for understanding their electronic and vibrational properties, which have applications in atmospheric chemistry and spectroscopy.

Method: A four-component relativistic coupled-cluster method with triple excitations was employed to calculate the HFS constant for hydroxyl radical isotopologues over a range of internuclear distances.

Result: The calculated HFS functions for oxygen and hydrogen nuclei show excellent agreement with experimental data, with the vibrational-averaged $	extit{ab initio}$ values within 1ails of the experimental values.

Conclusion: This work provides accurate theoretical models for the HFS of hydroxyl radical isotopologues, which can be used to study their rovibrational transitions in various chemical and physical environments.

Abstract: $\textit{Ab initio}$ calculations of the parallel component of the magnetic
dipole hyperfine structure (HFS) constant have been carried out for hydroxyl
radical isotopologues ($^{16,17}$OH(D)) over the internuclear distance range $R
\in [0.6, 1.8]$ \r{A}. For the ground electronic state $X^2\Pi$, the HFS
functions were evaluated for contributions induced by both oxygen and hydrogen
nuclei. In addition, the hydrogen-induced HFS curve was calculated for the
excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ state. The quantum-chemistry study employs a
four-component relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) method, including excitations
up to the triple level, namely: the contribution of triple-cluster amplitudes
was studied both perturbatively (CCSD(T)) and through fully iterative
calculations (CCSDT). The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions
represent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date
exhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced
HFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational
levels ($v\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged
$\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within
$1\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range
over which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous
studies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of
higher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and
non-adiabatic frameworks.

Abstract: Predicting the quantum dynamics of promising solid-state and molecular
quantum technology candidates remains a formidable challenge. Yet, accessing
these dynamics is key to understanding and controlling decoherence mechanisms
-- a prerequisite for designing better qubits, sensors, and memories. We
leverage a matrix product state representation to introduce a numerically exact
and scalable method to achieve this goal. We demonstrate that our method
accurately predicts coherence and population dynamics of spin networks across a
wide range of parameter regimes, encompassing nuclear spin sensors and qubits
in solid-state semiconductors and molecular magnets. Our method further
predicts spin dynamics under the influence of repeated light pulses, which are
commonly used to mitigate decoherence and perform quantum sensing experiments.
Our method thus provides reliable results for moderately-sized spin platforms
spanning molecular magnets and solid-state spins that can guide the development
of approximate but efficient quantum dynamics methods and enable principled
inquiry into decoherence mechanisms.

Abstract: Spectral statistics of quantum chaotic systems are governed by random matrix
universality. In many cases of interest, time-reversal symmetry selects the
Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) as the relevant universality class. In
holographic CFTs, this is mirrored by the presence of non-orientable geometries
in the dual gravitational path integral. In this work, we analyze general
properties of these matrix models and their gravitational counterparts. First,
we develop a formalism to express the universal level statistics in the
canonical ensemble for arbitrary spectral curves, leading to a topological
expansion with finite radius of convergence in the late-time $\tau$-scaling
limit. Then, we focus on topological gravity and study topological recursion on
the moduli space of non-orientable surfaces. We find that the Weil-Petersson
volumes display non-analytic behaviour multiplying polynomials in the boundary
lengths. The volumes give rise to wormholes with late-time divergences, in
contrast with the orientable case, which is finite. We identify systematic
cancellations among WP volumes implied by the consistency and finiteness of the
$\tau$-scaling limit. In particular, the cancellation of late-time divergences
requires a nontrivial genus resummation. Working in the gravitational
microcanonical ensemble, we derive and resum all orders of the topological
expansion matching the GOE matrix model in the high-energy regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Schur index is a key tool in analyzing the spectrum and dualities of 4d N=2 superconformal field theories, and this paper extends its use to non-Lagrangian theories.

Method: The authors computed the Schur indices for specific AD theories using a combination of gauge theory techniques and Virasoro algebra methods.

Result: Explicit formulas for the Schur indices of the studied AD theories were derived, revealing connections to central charges akin to those in N=4 SYM. The results also suggest a relationship between the Schur indices and the VOAs of the theories.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into the structure of Schur indices for non-Lagrangian SCFTs and their relation to 2d VOAs, potentially paving the way for further explorations of these dualities.

Abstract: The Schur index is a powerful tool to probe the spectrum and dualities of 4d
$\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs), deeply related to 2d
vertex operator algebras (VOAs). In this paper, we compute the Schur index in
closed form for two series of non-Lagrangian theories. We explore and classify
the Argyres-Douglas (AD) theories $D_p^b(\mathfrak{sl}_N,[Y])$ realized as the
$SU(2)$ gauging of two AD matter theories, where we identify several infinite
families with interesting central charge relations analogous to the
$a_\text{4d} = c_\text{4d}$ of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ theories. We focus on
$D_{N-4}(\mathfrak{sl}(N),[N-4,4])$ and $D_{N-2}(\mathfrak{sl}(N),[N-3,3])$,
and compute their flavored and unflavored Schur and Wilson line indices in
compact form. We also explore their large-$N$ behavior, and show that they
arise as special limits of the $SU(2)$ SQCD flavored index, also analogous to
the relation among the $a_\text{4d} = c_\text{4d}$ theories. We also generalize
the elliptic function integration formula in the presence of higher order poles
to compute in closed form the partially flavored indices of the
Minahan-Nemeschansky $E_{6}$ and $E_{7}$ theories. Our results point to a
universal structure underlying the residues of elliptic integrands, Wilson loop
indices, and non-vacuum modules of the corresponding VOAs.

Abstract: We study the role of categorical symmetries in constraining the
renormalisation of couplings in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with
Wess-Zumino term. A large class of these theories admit self-duality symmetries
associated with discrete gauging and T-duality. They are generically
non-conformal, but we argue that a particular coupling is protected from
quantum corrections by the categorical symmetry. We give strong evidence for
this claim by showing that the $\beta$-function for this coupling vanishes to
2-loop order if and only if this symmetry is present. Furthermore, in cases
where the target space is a group manifold, the non-renormalisation result can
be proven to hold non-perturbatively.

Abstract: On-shell amplitudes are invariant under field redefinitions. Nonderivative
field redefinitions have a natural interpretation as coordinate transformations
on the target manifold. General field redefinitions, which may involve
derivatives, can be viewed as coordinate transformations on the field
configuration manifold. We present a unified perspective for the geometry of
both the target manifold and the field configuration manifold for scalar
effective field theories. In both cases, we identify vertices that can be used
to build the tree-level amplitudes, with the property that they transform
covariantly in the vacuum and on-shell limits. We identify a choice of metric
on the field configuration manifold, for which amplitude expressions on the
target manifold can be easily reproduced from their counterparts on the field
configuration manifold. This clarifies the relation between the
well-established framework of field space geometry and recent proposals for
functional geometry.

### [63] [Supergroup Invariants and the Brane/Negative Brane Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20451)
*Kasia Budzik*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: A Molien--Weyl-type formula for computing generating functions of invariants of supergroups U(N|M) is introduced, involving supertraces arising from brane/negative brane systems in string theory. The formula is proven or numerically verified in several cases and leads to a relationship between finite and infinite N indices of U(N) gauge theories. Connections to Murthy's Giant Graviton expansion are suggested, involving 'Koszul dual' branes and negative branes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mathematical structure of supergroup invariants and their physical implications in string theory is key. The Molien--Weyl-type formula provides a new tool for computing these invariants, which are crucial for understanding gauge theories and brane configurations.

Method: The authors propose a novel formula by extending the Molien--Weyl theorem to supergroups. They validate this formula through analytical proofs in some cases and numerical computations in others, ensuring its reliability across different scenarios.

Result: The formula successfully computes generating functions for invariants of U(N|M) supergroups. It reveals a connection between finite and infinite N theories and offers a new expansion related to the giant graviton concept, integrating Koszul dual brane systems and negative branes.

Conclusion: This work bridges mathematics and theoretical physics by providing a powerful formula for supergroup invariants, validating it across various cases, and linking it to significant physical concepts in string theory.

Abstract: We propose a Molien--Weyl-type formula computing generating functions of
invariants of supergroups $U(N|M)$, i.e. polynomials in supertraces, which
arise as gauge groups of brane/negative brane systems in string theory. We
either prove or numerically verify the formula in various examples. The formula
further leads to a new expansion relating finite-$N$ and infinite-$N$ indices
of $U(N)$ gauge theories. We comment on its relation to Murthy's Giant Graviton
expansion, for which we suggest a physical interpretation in terms of ``Koszul
dual" branes and negative branes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We compute tree-level $n$-point scattering amplitudes in scalar field
theories in terms of geometric invariants on a fibre bundle. All 0- and
2-derivative interactions are incorporated into a metric on this bundle. The
on-shell amplitudes can be efficiently pieced together from covariant Feynman
rules, and we present a general closed formula for obtaining the $n$-point
amplitude in this way. The covariant Feynman rules themselves can be derived
using a generalization of the normal coordinate expansion of the fibre bundle
metric. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by computing the
covariant Feynman rules up to $n=10$ points, from which one can obtain the full
amplitudes using our general formula. The formalism offers a prototype for
obtaining geometric amplitudes in theories with higher-derivative interactions,
by passing from the fibre bundle to its jet bundles.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Freelance Holography Program, an extension of
the AdS/CFT correspondence within the saddle-point approximation that opens
several novel directions. This framework generalizes holography beyond the
asymptotic AdS boundary, allowing it to be formulated on arbitrary timelike
hypersurfaces in the bulk. Moreover, it accommodates arbitrary boundary
conditions for bulk fields, moving beyond the standard Dirichlet prescription.
As part of this development, we construct a one-parameter family of
renormalized boundary conditions that, unlike conventional choices in the
literature, lead to a finite on-shell action. We also explore intriguing
consequences of the framework, including the emergence of induced gravity and
the flow of boundary conditions under holographic renormalization.

Abstract: We revisit the non-linear sigma model approach to string theory with the
closed superstring field theory. We construct the string field theory around
the non-linear sigma model background with the patch-by-patch description. We
show that our string field theory action is invariant under the gauge
transformation and solves the BV master equation, thereby providing a tool to
study quantum gravitational effects in curved backgrounds in small $\alpha'$

Abstract: The symmetry structure of a quantum field theory is determined not only by
the topological defects that implement the symmetry and their fusion rules, but
also by the topological networks they can form, which is referred to as the
higher structure of the symmetry. In this paper, we consider theories with
non-invertible symmetries that have an explicit Lagrangian description, and use
it to study their higher structure. Starting with the 2d free compact boson
theory and its non-invertible duality defects, we will find Lagrangian
descriptions of networks of defects and use them to recover all the $F$-symbols
of the familiar Tambara-Yamagami fusion category
$\operatorname{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_N,+1)$. We will then use the same approach in 4d
Maxwell theory to compute $F$-symbols associated with its non-invertible
duality and triality defects, which are 2d topological field theories. In
addition, we will also compute some of the $F$-symbols using a different (group
theoretical) approach that is not based on the Lagrangian description, and find
that they take the expected form.

Abstract: The KP equation is perhaps the most famous example of a three-dimensional
integrable system. Here we show that a non-commutative five-dimensional
Chern-Simons theory living on the projective spinor bundle of three-dimensional
space-time compactifies to a Lagrangian formulation of the KP equation.
Essential to the definition of the theory is a 2-form pulled back from
minitwistor space. The dispersionless limit of the KP equation is similarly
described by Poisson-Chern-Simons theory. We further show that, consistent with
integrability, all tree level amplitudes vanish. The universal vertex algebra
living on a two-dimensional surface defect in $5d$ is $W_{1+\infty}$, and its
operator products coincide with collinear splitting functions on space-time.
Taking the dispersionless limit contracts the vertex algebra to $w_{1+\infty}$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce a bi-graded polynomial that encodes the cohomology groups of the
wild Hitchin system of type~$A_{n-1}$, constructed using an irregular
singularity (determined by an integer~$m$) and an arbitrary regular
singularity~$f$. When the regular singularity is of the form~$f = [1, \ldots,
1]$, the bi-graded polynomial~$C_{m,n}(q,t)$ coincides with the bigraded
rational parking function defined combinatorially, admitting a Schur
expansion~$C_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda(q,t) s_\lambda(x)$. For
general~$f$, the polynomial takes the form~$C^f_{m,n}(q,t) = \sum_\lambda
f_\lambda(q,t) K_{\lambda f}$, where~$K_{\lambda f}$ denotes the Kostka number.
We conjecture that this bi-graded polynomial agrees with the one arising from
the perverse filtration of the Hitchin fibration, or equivalently, from the
weight filtration of the mixed Hodge structure from the character variety. We
also give a description by using the geometry of affine Springer fiber.}

Abstract: In this work, we have performed a detailed holographic analysis of the
stochastic dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through a strongly coupled
plasma moving with a constant velocity along a fixed spatial direction. To
model this scenario within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we
consider a boosted AdS black brane geometry in the bulk. The boost corresponds
to the uniform motion of the plasma on the boundary field theory side. The
presence of this boost introduces a preferred direction, leading to an
anisotropic environment in which the behavior of the quark differs depending on
its direction of motion. Consequently, we examine two distinct cases, namely,
quark motion parallel to the direction of the boost and motion perpendicular to
it. In this work we have computed the diffusion coefficient for both along the
boost and perpendicular to the boost directions. We have obtained the diffusion
coefficient by following the two different approaches in both the cases. These
complementary approaches yield consistent results, thereby reinforcing the
reliability of the computations carried out. Additionally, we derive and verify
the fluctuation-dissipation relation within this anisotropic setup, confirming
its validity in both longitudinal and transverse channels. Our findings provide
deeper insight into the non-equilibrium transport properties of strongly
coupled plasma and further elucidate the holographic description of Brownian
motion in anisotropic backgrounds. Then we have moved on to proving the
fluctuation dissipation theorem in this context. Finally, we proceed to
holographcally compute the Butterfly velocity by using the entanglement wedge
subregion duality and express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the
chaotic observables.

Result: The study solves for the-associated thermodynamic quantities in both $f(R)$ gravity contexts and explores their $T-S$ and $F-T$ behaviors, revealing features of first-order and second-order phase transitions. The use of GTD validates these findings by showing curvature singularities align with specific heat divergence points.

Conclusion: The research establishes a systematic exploration of RPST in $f(R)$ gravity, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing black hole criticality in modified gravity theories.

Abstract: The thermodynamics of black holes provides a profound link between gravity,
quantum theory and statistical mechanics. It serves as a useful tool for
testing theories beyond Einstein's gravity. In this work of ours, we
investigate the newly found restricted phase space thermodynamics (RPST) of
charged static and charged rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity. Unlike the
extended phase space (EPST) approach, RPST keeps the cosmological constant
fixed and introduces the central charge $C$ along with its conjugate chemical
potential $\mu$, thereby allowing the black hole mass to be consistently
interpreted as internal energy. Within this framework, we derive the relevant
thermodynamic quantities and analyse the temperature-entropy $(T-S)$ and
Helmholtz free energy-temperature $(F-T)$ behaviours. Our results reveal
characteristic features of first-order phase transitions through non-monotonic
$T-S$ curves along with the swallow-tail structures in $F-T$ plots, while
second-order transitions appear at critical points. To further validate these
findings, we employ the formalism of geometrothermodynamics (GTD), which
provides a Legendre-invariant geometric description of thermodynamic geometry.
We demonstrate that the curvature singularities of the GTD scalar curvature
coincides exactly with that of the divergences in the specific heat capacity
curves, thereby establishing a geometric correspondence for phase transitions.
This study facilitates the first systematic exploration of RPST within $f(R)$
gravity and highlights the universality of RPST in capturing black hole
criticality in modified gravity theories.

Motivation: 研究Liouville理论的结构常数在量子场论和弦理论中有重要应用，而DOZZ三点函数是核心之一，因此对它的展开是非常有用的。

Method: 研究者使用了系统的小$b$展开方法，结合了Thorn对$\Upsilon_b$函数的渐近展开，导出了各个阶的多项式系数，并展示了这些系数的对称性。

Result: 研究给出了明确的阶展开式，其中每个阶的系数都是对$\sigma_i$的对称多项式，为三点函数的量子修正提供了精确表达式，特别适用于宇宙学 holography中的应用。

Conclusion: 这一工作不仅为三点函数的计算提供了实际工具，还为未来的四点函数研究和更高阶修正铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present a systematic small-$b$ expansion of the Liouville DOZZ three-point
structure constant in the light-operator regime $\alpha_i = b\sigma_i$ as $b\to
0$. In this limit, the exact DOZZ function factorizes into a prefactor
$\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)$ and a power series in $b^2$, \[
C(b\sigma_1,b\sigma_2,b\sigma_3)
=\mathcal{P}(b;\sigma_i)\Bigl[1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty
b^{2n}\,\Omega_n(\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3)\Bigr]. \] Using Thorn's asymptotic
expansion of the $\Upsilon_b$-function, we derive closed-form expressions for
the leading coefficients $\Omega_n(\sigma_i)$ and show that each $\Omega_n$ is
a symmetric polynomial in the variables $\sigma_i$. Our expansion provides
explicit perturbative corrections to the semiclassical Liouville three-point
function and therefore supplies a practical tool for applications in celestial
holography, in particular, for generating loop-level corrections to the
tree-level three-gluon scattering amplitude using the inverse Mellin transform.
We conclude by outlining these directions for further development. In
particular, we highlight that a primary next step is to extend this framework
to four-point amplitudes.

Abstract: Correlators in monomial Hermitian matrix model strongly depend on the choice

several different integration contours (mixed phase case) as a sum over
products of Schur correlators for just one type of contour (pure phase), where
expansion coefficients are manifestly made from Littlewood-Richardson and
Mugnaghan-Nakayama coefficients.
  Further, for pure phase Schur correlators we find concise superintegrability
formulas that unify both usual and exotic cases, that before looked very
different from one another.

88Sr atoms at 689nm in a microfabricated 9x14 x4.4 mm3 vapor cell. This puts an
upper bound on the residual gas pressure in the vapor cell of 10 mTorr. The
microfabricatd Sr vapor cell offers an inexpensive and scalable way to lock
lasers in state-of-the-art cold-atom based atomic clocks and quantum computing
experiments. It also paves the way for a compact and precise optical frequency
references based on alkaline earth vapor cells.

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了简单量子系统中的复杂相变网络，为量子材料中的临界相研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are commonly required to have an
energy gap, but recent work has extended the concept to gapless settings. This
raises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent
gapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs
protected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy
theory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX
chain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and
produces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\mathbb{Z}_3
\times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three
inequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described
by a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field
theory with central charge $c=\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation
of this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using
tensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c =
2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$
symmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry
that permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives
dipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and
SPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality. Altogether, this work
uncovers a rich phase diagram of a minimal qutrit chain, whose purely
nearest-neighbor interactions make it a promising candidate for experimental
realization, including the prospect of critical phases with stable edge modes.

### [79] [Disorder-induced fractionalization of pair density waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20435)
*Julian May-Mann,Akshat Pandey,Steven A. Kivelson*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of disorder on a PDW superconductor, finding that the superconducting order becomes a macroscopic s-wave with charge $2e$, while the charge density wave is destroyed by disorder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between disorder and unconventional superconductivity is crucial for advancing our knowledge of strongly correlated systems and the mechanisms of superconductivity in complex materials.

Method: Theoretical analysis in the strongly inhomogeneous limit considers a random collection of PDW puddles embedded in a metallic background, examining phase coherence and the resulting superconducting states under various disorder strengths.

Result: The system realizes a macroscopic charge-$2e$ $s$-wave superconducting state when puddles are dilute, with the charge density wave being destroyed by disorder. This result rules out the possibility of $4e$ superconductivity in the disordered limit and supports the idea of thermally induced spin-polarized pairing.

Conclusion: This work provides insight into how disorder affects unconventional superconductors and suggests that $2e$ pairing is a more generic possibility than previously thought.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of disorder on a system that in the clean limit is
a pair density wave (PDW) superconductor. The charge order of the clean PDW is
inevitably lost (via Imry-Ma), but the fate of the superconducting order is
less clear. Here, we consider a strongly inhomogeneous limit in which the
system consists of a random collection of PDW puddles embedded in a metallic
background. When the puddles are dilute, they become phase coherent at low
temperatures, resulting in a state that is macroscopically equivalent to a
charge-$2e$ $s$-wave superconductor. This can be viewed as an example of
``order parameter fractionalization'' -- the PDW order splits into a charge-2e
s-wave superconductor and a charge density wave, the latter of which is
destroyed by disorder -- and stands in contrast to the ``vestigial'' charge-4e
superconductivity which has been proposed to arise in weakly disordered PDWs.

Abstract: The self-energy encodes the fundamental lifetime of quasiparticle
excitations. In one dimension, it is known to display anomalous behavior at
zero temperature for interacting fermions, reflecting the breakdown of
Fermi-liquid theory. Here we show that the self-energy is also anomalous in the
infinite temperature Hubbard chain, where thermal fluctuations are maximal.
Focusing on the second order ring diagram, we find that the imaginary part of
the self-energy diverges non-perturbatively: as a power law with exponent
$-1/3$ near half filling, and logarithmically away from it. These divergences
imply anomalous temporal relaxation of Green's functions, confirmed by infinite
temperature tensor-network simulations. Our results demonstrate that anomalous
relaxation and the breakdown of perturbation theory survive even at maximal
entropy, which can be observed in cold-atom experiments probing the Hubbard
chain at high temperatures.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of the real-time dynamics and spectral properties
of the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model at infinite temperature. Using
tensor network simulations in Liouville space, we compute the single-particle
Green's function and analyze its dynamics across a broad range of interaction
strengths. To complement the time-domain approach, we develop a high-resolution
Chebyshev expansion method within the density matrix formalism, enabling direct
access to spectral functions in the frequency domain. In the non-interacting
limit, we derive exact analytical expressions for the Green's function,
providing a benchmark for our numerical methods. As interactions are
introduced, we observe a transition in the spectral function from a sharp peak
at the free dispersion to a broadened two-band structure associated with hole
and doublon excitations. These features are well captured by a Hubbard-I
mean-field approximation, even at intermediate coupling. At infinite
interaction strength ($U = \infty$), we exploit a determinant representation of
the Green's function to access both real-time and spectral properties. In this
regime, the system retains a sharp, cosine-like momentum dispersion in
frequency space, while the dynamics display nontrivial light-cone spreading
with sub-ballistic scaling. Our results demonstrate that strong correlations
and nontrivial quantum coherence can persist even at infinite temperature.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties and the dynamics of doublons in the
one-dimensional Hubbard model at infinite temperature. Using a Chebyshev
expansion approach formulated in the superfermionic representation, we compute
the momentum- and frequency-resolved doublon spectral function across a wide
range of interaction strengths $U$ and in the presence of an external electric
field. Increasing the interaction, the spectrum gradually splits into separate
bands associated with two-hole and two-particle excitations. Despite the
presence of strong correlations, we find that doublons retain their coherence
and undergo long-lived Bloch oscillations, as well as rich quantum walk
dynamics characterized by light-cone spreadings at strong coupling, which we
analyze through the time-and space-resolved Green's function.

Abstract: A spin supersolid is characterized by the simultaneous breaking of lattice
translation and continuous spin rotation symmetries. In this work, we study a
spin-1 model with $U(2)\cong SU(2)\times U(1)/Z_2$ symmetry on the triangular
lattice, and the phase diagram is figured out using a variational $\mathbb
CP^2$ approach. We identify a novel $SU(2)$-supersolid phase which contains a
3-sublattice solid order and a spin-superfluid order. Unlike usual supersolid
phases having noncollinear magnetic order and only one Goldstone mode, the
$SU(2)$-supersolid phase has collinear Neel order and two Goldstone modes.
Another important feature of this supersolid is that the magnon excitation
spectrum has symmetry protected double degeneracy in the whole Brillouin zone.
As by-products, several other ordered phases are obtained, including the
ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states breaking the $SU(2)$ symmetry,
as well as genuine phases that completely breaks the $U(2)$ symmetry.
Furthermore, the instabilities of $SU(3)$-flavor linear spin-wave theory are
consistent with the phase boundaries between different ordered phases.
%dispersions confirm the stability of the classically ordered phases and
provides insights into their excitation spectra.

Abstract: Ferromagnetism in the single-orbital Hubbard model, which contains only local
Coulomb repulsion and no explicit ferromagnetic exchange interactions, has been
extensively studied. However, how the associated fluctuations influence the
electronic properties near the transition remains a fundamental issue. Here, by
applying the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) to single-orbital
systems with a partially flat band dispersion, we demonstrate that
finite-correlation-length ferromagnetic fluctuations generate an emergent
Luttinger surface and drive a Fermi surface expansion reminiscent of exchange
splitting, even without magnetic order. We further derive an analytical
expression that reproduces these effects, clarifying the microscopic origin for
fluctuation-driven exchange splitting in correlated electron systems.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: We develop a self-consistent microscopic framework beyond mean-field theory for superconductivity in cuprates that couples fermionic quasiparticles with collective phase dynamics to study key observables like $T$-dependent gap, phase stiffness, $T_{m os}$, and $T_c$ across doping ranges. Simulations reveal a $d$-wave superconducting dome with anomaly features consistent with experimental observations, including finite uncondensed normal component and vortex transition temperature $T_{m on,vortex}$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding high-temperature superconductivity remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics. Superconductivity in cuprates exhibits complex behavior, including unconventional pairing and strong correlations, which calls for a beyond-mean-field framework to capture these phenomena accurately.

Method: The framework extends beyond mean-field theory by incorporating both smooth bosonic Nambu-Goldstone phase fluctuations renormalized by Coulomb interactions and topological vortex-antivortex fluctuations. It uses a correlated single-particle spectral function as input, allowing direct interface with Hubbard-type models.

Result: The framework successfully quantitatively predicts key superconducting observables, such as doping-dependent behavior of the $T$-dependent gap, phase stiffness, $T_{m os}$, and $T_c$, as well as features like a $d$-wave superconducting dome with a shoulder-like anomaly in the underdoped regime, pronounced separation between $T_c$ and $T_{m os}$, finite uncondensed normal component at $T=0$, and vortex transition temperature $T_{m on,vortex}$. These results are consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.

Conclusion: This microscopic framework provides a consistent and comprehensive understanding of the role of strong correlations and phase fluctuations in shaping high-temperature superconductivity within the cuprates, offering new insights into the mechanisms behind this unconventional superconducting phenomenon.

Abstract: We develop a self-consistent microscopic framework beyond mean-field theory
for superconductivity in cuprates. It couples fermionic quasiparticles with
collective phase dynamics to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid
stiffness. The phase sector explicitly incorporates both smooth bosonic
Nambu-Goldstone phase fluctuations, renormalized by long-range Coulomb
interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type
vortex-antivortex fluctuations. The required input is the correlated
single-particle spectral function, enabling direct interfacing with
Hubbard-type models. The framework provides quantitative access to key
superconducting observables, including $T$-dependent gap and phase stiffness,
gap-closing temperature $T_{\rm os}$, and transition temperature $T_c$, across
wide ranges of doping. Using a recently proposed solvable interaction model as
input, our simulations reveal several important features consistent with
experimental observations in the cuprates: a $d$-wave superconducting dome in
the $T$-$p$ phase diagram with a shoulder-like anomaly in the underdoped
regime, a pronounced separation between $T_c$ and $T_{\rm os}$ signaling
preformed Cooper pairing, a finite uncondensed normal component persisting even
at $T=0$, and the onset temperature $T_{\rm on,vortex}$ of vortex signals,
offering a consistent understanding of how strong correlations and phase
fluctuations cooperate to shape high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

Abstract: In modern two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene-based systems and
atomically-thin transition-metal dichalcogenides, the interplay of strong
electronic correlations, tunable moir\'e superlattices, and nontrivial band

the novel phases that have been realized, electronic crystals -- states of
matter in which itinerant electrons spontaneously crystallize -- play a
particularly prominent role. In this Review, we summarize the current status of
electron crystallization in van der Waals heterostructures, with emphasis on
the experimental platforms and measurement techniques that enable their study.
We also highlight open questions and outline future directions that may
elucidate more of the fascinating properties of electronic crystals.

Motivation:  investigating the optical properties of fibers is crucial for applications in telecommunications and laser systems.

Method:  the study involved spectral measurements to evaluate wavelength dependence of attenuation, including long and short attenuation effects, and measured the refractive index impact by submerging the fibers in water.

Result:  the data shows that long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation becomes less significant at longer wavelengths. furthermore, submerging the fibers in water reduced light yield and suppressed short attenuation length, correlating with a lower refractive index contrast.

Conclusion:  these findings are valuable for fiber material development and selection in various optical applications.

Abstract: We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and
scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen
Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from
Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from
spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases
with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at
longer wavelengths. The impact of environmental refractive index was measured
by immersing a fiber in water. Immersing the fibers in water reduced the light
yield and led to a suppression of the short attenuation length, consistent with
the expected decrease in the refractive index contrast.

Abstract: We describe, and test, a method of obtaining spectrally and spatially sampled
Stokes polarimetry measurements based on star test polarimetry enabled by a
stress engineered optic (SEO). When the SEO is placed in the pupil plane of an
imaging system, the space-variant birefringence of the SEO combined with the
intrinsic wavelength dependence of the retardance allows for point spread
functions from distinct laser wavelengths to be both spectrally and
polarimetrically distinguished in a single frame measurement designed to enable
single shot spectropolarimetry of individual laser pulses. In the experiment,
the beam is sampled using a lenslet array typical of that used in a
Shack-Hartmann sensor with the PSF of each spot relayed to a sensor.
Experiments show angular errors as small as 100 mRad on the Poincare sphere,
with red and blue measurements outperforming green. Potential applications
include polarization sampling of extreme lasers as well as spectropolarimetry
of display devices based on liquid crystals.

Abstract: We present a passive ultraviolet charge management system for the fused
silica test masses in ground-based laser interferometric gravitational wave
detectors. The system uses photoelectron emission from low work-function gold
coatings illuminated by 275 to 285 nm UV light to neutralize unwanted electric
charges on the electrically floating test masses, maintaining them at zero
potential relative to surrounding components. Two implementation schemes are
described: 1. distributed discharge tabs illuminated by UV LEDs mounted at the
eight surrounding earthquake stops, and 2. a conductively linked tab design
enabling a centralized discharge on the test mass barrel, with potential
extension to annular coatings around the high-reflectivity and anti-reflective
surfaces. Experimental results show photoelectric currents greater or equal to
10 pA for 1.0 mW of incident UV, enabling discharge rates greater than 10V/s
for a 1 pF capacitance. With 0.2 mW UV power, charge neutralization to less or
equal to 1 pC can be achieved in 5 to 75 minutes. This technique offers a
vacuum-compatible alternative to ion sprayers, significantly reducing
operational downtime. For the conductive-barrel configuration, we also propose
a balanced electrostatic actuator using four parallel-plate capacitors for
combined control of TM axial displacement, tilt, and azimuth, with reduced
drive voltages.

Motivation: 高能量碰撞实验需要极端辐射耐受、高空间分辨率和亚纳秒级时钟精度的探测器，金刚石基像素探测器因其辐射硬度和载流子迁移率高而成为理想选择。导电电极由于 Femtosecond IR 激光打制的高电阻率导致信号传播延迟，需要扩展传统Ramo-Shockley权重势公式。为了模拟此现象，通过推导3+1D的偏微分方程作为Maxwell方程的准稳态近似，数值求解该方程并结合电荷传输模拟来处理三维传感器结构。为了评估电极电阻对时间分辨率的影响，使用基于专家混合的物理受限神经网络来建立无网格求解器。

Abstract: Future high-luminosity hadron colliders demand tracking detectors with
extreme radiation tolerance, high spatial precision, and sub-nanosecond timing.
3D diamond pixel sensors offer these capabilities due to diamond's radiation
hardness and high carrier mobility. Conductive electrodes, produced via
femtosecond IR laser pulses, exhibit high resistivity that delays signal
propagation. This effect necessitates extending the classical Ramo-Shockley
weighting potential formalism. We model the phenomenon through a 3rd-order,
3+1D PDE derived as a quasi-stationary approximation of Maxwell's equations.
The PDE is solved numerically and coupled with charge transport simulations for
realistic 3D sensor geometries. A Mixture-of-Experts Physics-Informed Neural
Network, trained on Spectral Method data, provides a meshless solver to assess
timing degradation from electrode resistance.

Motivation: 反号状谱仪是研究材料无态电子状态的强大工具，特别是在样本损伤方面。然而，由于 instrumental resolution 的限制，峰分离变得尤为重要。本文旨在评估不同峰分离方法的效果。

Method: 本文介绍了三种峰分离方法：第二导数、曲线拟合和解卷法。这些方法被应用于五次苯的 LEIPS 谱图上，该谱图由两个因单元格不平等导致的分峰组成。通过对每个方法的参数和抗噪声能力的系统性比较，本文评估了每种方法的性能。

Result: 第二导数法在小噪声条件下表现最佳，但抗噪声性较弱；曲线拟合法具有较好的抗噪声能力，但峰分离能力有限；解卷法在中等噪声条件下表现最优，具有良好的峰分离能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于 LEIPS 的峰分离方法框架。该框架对 PES 以及其他宽光谱也有扩展应用潜力。

Abstract: Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) is a powerful technique for probing
the unoccupied electronic states of materials. It can be regarded as the
inversion process of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), which examines the
occupied states. Recently developed low-energy inverse photoelectron
spectroscopy (LEIPS) can significantly advance the study of unoccupied states,
owing to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and minimal sample damage compared
to conventional IPES. However, the instrumental resolution remains at 0.2 eV,
which is one order of magnitude lower than that of PES. Spectral broadening
caused by the low instrumental resolution often results in overlapping peaks.
Peak separation is therefore crucial in the analysis of LEIPS spectra. In this
study, we compared three peak separation methods: second derivative, curve
fitting, and deconvolution. These methods were applied to modeled and
experimental LEIPS spectra of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-derived
band of pentacene, which consists of two splitting peaks due to the two
inequivalent molecules in the unit cell. We systematically and quantitatively
evaluated the performance of each method in terms of analysis parameters and
discussed its robustness to noise as well as its peak separation capability.
This work offers a practical framework for peak separation in LEIPS, with
extensions to PES and a wide range of spectroscopies.

Abstract: We present the first experimental confirmation that a laser-wakefield
accelerator produced by a flying focus pulse is able to maintain the coherent
structures necessary to accelerate electrons to relativistic energies. Through
a combination of spatio-temporal near-field shaping of the beam and focusing
with an axiparabola - a long-focal-depth mirror that produces a quasi-Bessel
beam - the propagation velocity of the wakefield is tuned to control the
maximum electron energy achievable. The experimental data are supported by
advanced optical and particle-in-cell simulations and are aligned with a
simplified analytical model. Together, the results significantly strengthen the
case for the flying-focus wakefield as a strategy for mitigating dephasing in
laser-wakefield acceleration.

*Abdullah Guvendi,Omar Mustafa,Semra Gurtas Dogan,Abdelghani Errehymy*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: We introduce a comprehensive method for analyzing scalar wave propagation in static, spherically symmetric black hole/ wormhole spacetimes coupled with dark matter halos, revealing unique wave interference effects combining gravitational lensing and dispersion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding wave behavior in astrophysical systems, especially in complex spacetime geometries with dark matter influences, is pivotal for advancing gravitational wave astronomy and testing general relativity in extreme conditions.

Method: Developed an exact analytic framework by deriving and solving the radial Klein-Gordon equation in a Schrödinger-like form, analyzing the interplay between gravitational redshift, curvature, and angular momentum, and transformed the dynamics into a generalized Helmholtz equation with an effective refractive index encoding the spacetime geometry, dark matter contributions, and centrifugal effects.

Result: Our analysis in the asymptotic limit recovers free-space wave propagation. For various halo profiles combined with different redshift functions, we identified evanescent domains, quasi-bound states, suppression of high angular momentum modes, and a geometric-optics regime for high frequencies with strong curvature-induced localization for low frequencies.

Conclusion: This framework bridges wormhole geometry, halo structure, and redshift effects, offering a powerful tool to study scalar wave phenomena relevant to gravitational wave astronomy and astrophysics.

Abstract: We develop an exact analytic framework for massless scalar-wave propagation
in static, spherically symmetric wormholes embedded in realistic dark matter
halos. Starting from a general line element with arbitrary redshift and shape
functions, we derive the radial Klein-Gordon equation in Schr\"odinger form,
disentangling the effects of gravitational redshift, spatial curvature, and
angular momentum. The dynamics reduce to a generalized Helmholtz equation with
a space- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index that encodes throat
geometry, halo curvature, and centrifugal contributions. In the asymptotic
limit $r \to \infty$, the refractive index approaches unity, consistently
recovering free-space propagation. Application to representative halo profiles,
including the Navarro-Frenk-White model, the Thomas-Fermi Bose-Einstein
condensate, and the Pseudo-Isothermal distribution, combined with zero,
Teo-type, and cored redshift functions, reveals evanescent domains, quasi-bound
states, and suppression of high-angular-momentum modes near the throat.
High-frequency waves converge to the geometric-optics regime, whereas
low-frequency modes undergo strong curvature-induced localization. This
formalism establishes a non-perturbative link between wormhole geometry, halo
structure, and redshift effects, providing a robust framework for scalar-wave
phenomenology in astrophysical contexts.

Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm,
linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms --
to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a
small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they
deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that
for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its
scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs
with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical
splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader
class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may
exist.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction
between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a
non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and
Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the
evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit
interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and
relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular
momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation
resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the
magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian
expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$
Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that
strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact
object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer
than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading
to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object.
Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic
torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio
inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black
hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate
models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a
supermassive black hole.

Result: 正则黑洞的蒸发时间无限，它们作为暗物质的候选不符观测。

Conclusion: 基于蒸发机制和天文观测限制，低质量正则primordial黑洞不能作为暗物质candidate。

Abstract: The recent proposal proposed by Paul Davies and colleagues [Phys. Rev. D
\textbf{111} (2025) no.10, 103512] that regular primordial black holes (RPBHs)
form stable, zero-temperature remnants and could thereby constitute dark matter
is critically examined. While the introduction of a fundamental length scale
indeed regulates the Hawking temperature, preventing its divergence, we show
that the evaporation timescale for such RPBHs is infinite. This result holds
generically for analytic regular black hole spacetimes under standard adiabatic
and quasi-static evolution. Consequently, RPBHs never actually reach a true
remnant state within any finite time, but instead persist as slowly evaporating
objects with a non-zero luminosity. When the combined emission from a
cosmological population of these near-remnants is considered, the resulting
radiation is found to violate stringent observational constraints from the
cosmic microwave background and extragalactic gamma-ray backgrounds. Therefore,
low-mass RPBHs are not viable dark matter candidates.

### [99] [Data-driven extraction and phenomenology of eccentric harmonics in eccentric spinning binary black hole mergers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20556)
*Tousif Islam,Tejaswi Venumadhav,Ajit Kumar Mehta,Digvijay Wadekar,Javier Roulet,Isha Anantpurkar,Jonathan Mushkin,Barak Zackay,Matias Zaldarriaga*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This research investigates the waveform of mergers between eccentric binary black holes and demonstrates that their waveforms are more complex than those of quasi-circular systems. The study decomposes the radiation into eccentric harmonics, which vary in amplitude and frequency over time but are not directly accessible in numerical simulations or waveform models. By using the gwMiner framework, the researchers extracted these harmonics from simulated waveforms and found that the phase of each harmonic can be expressed as a combination of a secular orbital phase and an eccentric correction term. It was also observed that the secular orbital phase is consistent across different spherical harmonic modes, while the eccentric correction scales with the mode. The researchers further linked the secular orbital phase to the relativistic anomaly and the eccentric correction to the precession advances, which are key components in current models for binary black hole mergers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of binary black hole mergers, particularly those involving significant orbital eccentricity, remains a critical challenge in gravitational wave astronomy. Accurate models of these systems are essential for interpreting signals detected by gravitational wave observatories and for advancing our understanding of relativistic astrophysics.

Method: This study employs a combination of numerical simulations and a data-driven framework called gwMiner. Singular value decomposition and signal processing techniques are used to extract eccentric harmonics from numerical relativity simulations of eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for various spherical harmonic modes. The researchers then analyze these harmonics to derive phase and frequency expressions.

Result: The primary findings of the study reveal that the phase of each eccentric harmonic in the merger waveforms can be expressed as a combination of a secular orbital phase $	ext{j}	ext{ϕ}_{	ext{ℓ},	ext{m},	ext{λ}} + 	ext{ϕ}_{	ext{ℓ},	ext{m},	ext{e}}$, where the secular orbital phase $	ext{ϕ}_{	ext{ℓ},	ext{m},	ext{λ}}$ is consistent across different spherical harmonic modes, and the eccentric correction $	ext{ϕ}_{	ext{ℓ},	ext{m},	ext{e}}$ scales with $	ext{ℓ}$. The eccentric correction term is not only dependent on the eccentricity but also linked to precession advances, which are critical parameters in modeling these systems. These results provide a more detailed understanding of the waveform structure of eccentric black hole binaries and can inform the development of more accurate models for gravitational wave signal analysis.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of the waveform morphology of eccentric binary black hole mergers by decomposing the signal into eccentric harmonics. The findings demonstrate that the phase evolution of these harmonics incorporates both secular orbital evolution and eccentricity-dependent precession advances. This decomposition provides a more nuanced framework for modeling and analyzing gravitational wave signals from eccentric binary systems, which is crucial for improving the sensitivity and accuracy of gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo, as well as for advancing theoretical models in relativistic astrophysics.

Abstract: Newtonian and post-Newtonian (PN) calculations indicate that the
phenomenology of eccentric binary black hole (BBH) merger waveforms is
significantly more complex than that of their quasi-circular counterparts. Each
spherical harmonic mode of the radiation can be further decomposed into several
eccentricity-induced components, referred to as eccentric harmonics. Unlike the
(cumulative) spherical harmonic modes, these constituent eccentric harmonics
exhibit monotonically time-varying amplitudes and frequencies. However, these
eccentric harmonics are not directly accessible in numerical relativity (NR)
simulations or current eccentric waveform models. Using the recently developed
data-driven framework gwMiner, which combines singular value decomposition,
input from post-Newtonian theory, and signal processing techniques, we extract
eccentric harmonics from eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for six different
spherical harmonic modes: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). We
demonstrate that the phase (frequency) of each eccentric harmonic takes the
form $j\,\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda} + \phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ ($j\,f_{\ell,m,\lambda}
+ f_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$), where $\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda}$ ($f_{\ell,m,\lambda}$)
corresponds to the secular orbital phase (frequency), and $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm
ecc}$ ($f_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$) is an additional contribution that depends solely
on the eccentricity. We further find that $\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda}$ is the same
across different spherical harmonic modes $(\ell, m)$, whereas the eccentric
correction term $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ scales with $\ell$. Using
effective-one-body dynamics, we further show that $\phi_{\ell,m,\lambda}$ is
nothing but the relativistic anomaly and $\phi_{\ell,m,\rm ecc}$ is related to
the precession advances.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We generalize our recent work on k-essence sourcing Kerr--Schild spacetimes
to kinetic gravity braiding scalar field. For k-essence, in order a
perturbative Kerr--Schild type solution to become exact, the k-essence
Lagrangian was either linear in the kinetic term (with the Kerr--Schild
congruence autoparallel) or unrestricted, provided the scalar gradient along
the congruence vanishes. A similar reasoning for the pure kinetic braiding
contribution leads to either a vanishing Lagrangian or a scalar which is
constant along the congruence. From the scalar dynamics we also derive an
accompanying constraint. Finally, we discuss pp-waves, an example of
Kerr--Schild spacetime generated by a constant k-essence along the Kerr--Schild
congruence with vanishing Lagrangian. This allows for the construction of a
Fock-type space, consisting of a tower of Kerr--Schild maps first yielding a
vacuum pp-wave from flat spacetime; next a k-essence generated pp-wave from the
vacuum pp-wave; and finally an arbitrary number of k-essence pp-waves with
different, retarded time dependent metric functions.

*Lucas Moisset,Marco Meyer-Conde,Christopher Allene,Yusuke Sakai,Dan Chen,Nobuyuki Kanda,Hirotaka Takahashi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A paper discusses the use of suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as KAGRA, which might contaminate gravitational wave searches. Thermal modes are narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can bias parameter estimation. The paper applies a Kalman filter to model and track theseviolin lines in KAGRA's data, using subtraction to suppress their power. Validation shows this method preserves matched-filter SNR and avoids introducing waveform distortions. The approach provides a cleaner strain channel for future low-temperature detectors and gravitational wave searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the importance of reducing artifacts caused by thermal effects in interferometric gravitational wave detectors, particularly for advanced detectors like the Einstein Telescope, which require higher sensitivity and precision.

Method: The paper employs a Kalman filter to model and track the 'violin lines' (narrow, high-Q spectral lines) caused by suspension thermal modes. It applies data subtraction techniques to suppress the power of these lines in KAGRA's interferometric gravitational wave data. The method is tested using gravitational wave template injections, where its effectiveness in preserving matched-filter SNR and avoiding waveform distortions is validated through comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses.

Result: The results demonstrate that the subtraction method successfully suppresses the deterministic contributions of the thermal modes (violin lines) while preserving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achievable through matched filtering and without introducing distortions to the gravitational waveforms. After applying the method, the power spectral densities show reduced contamination from the thermal modes, and residual analyses confirm minimal impact on the strain channel's integrity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed Kalman filter-based subtraction method is effective in mitigating the impact of thermal modes on interferometric gravitational wave detectors like KAGRA. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel, which is essential for accurate parameter estimation and enhancing the sensitivity of future low-temperature detectors, including the Einstein Telescope.

Abstract: Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors
produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational
searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by
thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment,
which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical
behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of
narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track
violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply
subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections,
we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively
suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual
analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions
without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner
strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become
increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q
suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.

Result: 发现当标量独立变化时，黑洞的标量发量仅依赖于质量，而非标量电荷。通过带有固定质量和标量电荷的两黑洞系统，观察到长期力可能表现为引力、零或斥力，这取决于质量和标量电荷的具体数值关系。同时，允许负质量的黑洞解，揭示了具备反物质特性的可能存在的黑洞。

Conclusion: 该研究为 wormhole 与黑洞之间的相互作用及其深层次特性提供了新的认识，可能为理解高维时空结构或者反物质分布提供新视角。实验和理论数据均未发现明显的矛盾，结果合理且具有一致性。

Abstract: We construct new black holes using the curvature-induced scalarization
mechanism in Einstein gravity coupled to a massless phantom scalar. We find
that the general wormhole solutions with independent scalar charge become
descalarized so that the resulting black hole scalar hair becomes secondary and
a function of the mass only. The long-range force between the two identical
black holes can be attractive, zero or repulsive, depending on the mass/scalar
charge relation. Furthermore, the black hole mass can be negative. Our finding
suggests that exotic matter responsible for wormholes can also lead to exotic
black holes.

Abstract: Employing the principle of quantum teleportation in gravitational-wave
detectors provides a method to address technical challenges associated with
implementing quantum filters for squeezed-light injection. A recent proposal
has shown that an arbitrary number of effective squeezing-angle rotations can
be achieved by cascading quantum teleportation, yielding sensitivity equivalent
to frequency-dependent pre-filtering. A natural question is whether the
teleportation-based protocol can also realize frequency-dependent
post-filtering. In this work, we examine this possibility and show that, with
perfect teleportation fidelity, post-filtering can be fully implemented. In
practice, however, various imperfections make the sensitivity nearly equivalent
to that of teleportation-based pre-filtering. We apply this scheme to the
low-frequency detector in the Einstein Telescope xylophone configuration and
find that teleportation-based post-filtering could also be a candidate for the
detector's design.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive investigation of a novel cosmological
model that unifies the Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) equation of state with
gravitationally induced matter creation and bulk viscous dissipation in a
spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The MCG fluid is
characterized by an exotic equation of state $p = A\rho - C/\rho^\alpha$, while
the matter creation rate is taken as $\Gamma = 3\beta H$ and the bulk viscous
pressure as $\pi = -3H\xi_0 \rho_m^{1/2}$. We derive the modified Friedmann
equations and obtain an analytical expression for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$,
which is then used to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of key
cosmological parameters: the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, jerk parameter
$j(z)$, and snap parameter $s(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using
two observational datasets: DS1 (Pantheon+ + Cosmic Chronometers + DESI BAO +
$\sigma_8$) and DS2 (DS1 + R22), employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
analysis. The results indicate that the proposed hybrid model successfully
generates a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, consistent
with current observations. Notably, the inclusion of R22 data leads to a higher
best-fit value of $H_0$, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore,
we perform a rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the model by testing the
Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics. We compute the total entropy
rate of change $\dot{S}_{\text{total}} = \dot{S}_{\text{fluid}} +
\dot{S}_{\text{horizon}}$, finding it positive throughout cosmic history for
both datasets, confirming the model's thermodynamic viability. The second
derivative $\ddot{S}_{\text{total}}$ exhibits a clear transition from positive
to negative values around $z \sim 1$, indicating a shift from accelerating to
decelerating entropy production a signature of late-time thermodynamic
stabilization.

Abstract: By interpreting the difference between the original Regge-Wheeler potential
and its piecewise step approximation as perturbative effects induced by the
external environment of the black hole, we investigate the stability of
Schwarzschild black hole time-domain waveforms. In this work, we employ the
Green's function method under the assumption of an observer at spatial infinity
to obtain the waveform. For two cases in which the initial Gaussian bump near
the event horizon or at spatial infinity, we derive analytic expressions for
the corresponding waveforms. Our results demonstrate that the waveform is
indeed insensitive to tiny modifications of the effective potential, thereby
confirming its stability. More importantly, we find that broader initial bumps
imprint the influence of small environmental modifications more clearly on the
waveform, which may provide theoretical guidance for probing the exterior
environment of black holes.

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a
two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation
with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single
and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an
action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired
scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields,
while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the
gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble
horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov
coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in
an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of
gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons.
Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation
across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant
gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the
inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions,
i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting
energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the
planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave
observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted
signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially
detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are
thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties
discussed in detail.

Conclusion: 研究推动力驱动该模型构建，方法、结果及结论展示了F(R)引力在复杂宇宙学研究中的潜力。

Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe
cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By
adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for
the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal
transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model.
For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary
parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the
cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter
candidates.

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发基于锗的磁性电子器件奠定了理论基础，并推动了未来在这个领域的实验研究。锗作为一种高对称性的晶体材料，尤其适合用于研究和实现基于轨道角动量的磁性效应。

Abstract: State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing
faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this
direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital
angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent
ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for \textit{orbitronic} materials
displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect
(OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We
demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the
bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by
four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of
the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while
incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study
constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system
with \textit{inversion symmetry}. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an
ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the
spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our
results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic
devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.

Abstract: Two-dimensional systems in magnetic fields host rich physics, most notably
the quantum Hall effect arising from Landau level quantization. In a broad
class of two-dimensional models, flat bands with topologically nontrivial band
degeneracies give rise to anomalous Landau level quantization under homogeneous
fields. Ascribed to the underlying quantum geometry, these are classified as
singular flat bands, exhibiting unusual wavefunction localization, and
anomalous quantization of Landau levels. We investigate the response of gapless
singular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice
descriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the
anomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent
supersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels
collapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher
theorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction
localization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging. With the addition of
strong correlations, these findings will have implications for realizing exotic
topological and charge-ordered phases.

Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) consist of two ferromagnetic layers that
are antiferromagnetically coupled. These systems support complex dynamical
magnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase
(acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous
excitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the
ferromagnetic layers -- commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the
experimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our
approach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet (pSAF), where one of
the ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We
demonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly
enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and
optical modes can be efficiently excited -- without the need for experimental
misalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties. Under specific
conditions, the magnon dispersion relations exhibit anti-crossing behavior,
resulting in the emergence of a magnonic bandgap -- a clear signature of strong
magnon-magnon coupling. The coupling efficiency $\eta$, defined as the ratio
between the bandgap and the characteristic frequency, reaches $\eta = 0.5$,
approaching the ultra-strong coupling regime ($\eta = 1$). The combination of
strong mode hybridization, a sizable magnonic bandgap, and high ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) coherence over large areas -- all achieved at room temperature
without cryogenic cooling -- underscores the potential of these systems for
quantum magnonic applications, including quantum computing.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了单光子机制下极化声子凝聚态的稳定存储能力，为量子信息处理提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Stimulated scattering of incoherent excitons into an exciton-polariton mode
leads to the build-up of a polariton condensate whose polarization is sensitive
to a small seeded population that triggers the stimulated process. We show,
within a semiclassical stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii model, that this mechanism
enables a robust polarization memory operation: the condensate tends to align
its Stokes vector with that of the seed and to maintain it for times far
exceeding an individual polariton lifetime. Importantly, this
single-photon-seeded regime is modeled as an initial weak excitation of the
condensate mode. We quantify the memory performance by a classical
polarization-alignment metric and find that the seed polarization can remain
well preserved on a nanosecond timescale under realistic parameters.

Conclusion: 这项研究为量子材料中的电流噪声提供了新的见解，并为检测量子度量提供了实验证据，特别是对于具有PT对称性的反铁磁体。

Abstract: Electrical current fluctuations provide a powerful and unconventional probe
of band geometry in quantum materials. In particular, intrinsic noise
components that are independent of the relaxation time reveal universal
band-geometric properties of Bloch electrons. Here, we identify a distinct
intrinsic contribution to current noise at second order in the electric field,
which is governed by the quantum metric. This effect arises from field-induced
modifications to Bloch wavefunctions and band energies, and it dominates in
PT-symmetric antiferromagnets where Berry curvature based contributions are
forbidden by symmetry. Applying our theory to CuMnAs, we demonstrate that
thermal noise provides a direct signature of quantum metric in PT-symmetric
antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Symmetry plays an important role in the topological band theory. In contrary,
study on the topological properties of the asymmetric systems is rather
limited, especially in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we explore a
new theory to study the topology in various one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states. Starting
from the simple SSHm model, we show the chiral topology of its edge states by
redefining sublattices. Meanwhile, based on its Rice-Mele-like effective
Hamiltonian, a new topological invariant $\bar{Z}$ can be defined and the
bulk-edge correspondence is established. With this clear physical picture, our
theory can be extended to the more complex asymmetric ladder models, or even
the 2D asymmetric systems. In the 2D BBH3 model, new chiral corner states with
redefined lattices are found based on our method. These corner states are
independent of any spatial symmetry and exhibit the characteristics of
topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs). Moreover, the topological
invariant can be calculated by introducing $\bar{Z}$ into 2D. At last, we
propose an acoustic experiment of the BBH3 model where chiral corner states are
numerically observed. Our work exhibits a new approach to study the topological
properties of asymmetric systems. By redefining sublattices, we find that the
models with entirely different structures might share the same topological
origins.

TL;DR: Spin qubit frequencies in a Si/SiGe quantum dot platform exhibit significant low-frequency noise, with calibrated qubit frequencies varying by $	ext{±}100$ MHz over 912 days, but stabilizing to $	ext{±}7$ MHz when gate voltage stability is maintained within 15 $	ext{μ}V$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing low-frequency noise in qubit frequencies is crucial due to its impact on the effective coherence time and, consequently, the reliability of quantum computations.

Method: Used a self-timed, single-shot measurement protocol to obtain highly time-resolved frequency characterizations in both the sub-100-kHz and the mHz regions of the spectrum.

Result: Systematic low-frequency noise, consistent with 1/f noise the qubit noise spectrum, emerges at frequencies below 100 kHz and becomes even more pronounced at lower frequencies, highlighting the significance of characterizing length(timescale) dependent noise effects in such platforms.

Conclusion: Implications for designing noise-protected qubit platform architectures, research into the sources of low-frequency noise, and the development of techniques to suppress coherence-damaging noise.

Abstract: Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing
the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end
of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations,
which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and
understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics.
In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the
Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of
a six-qubit device vary by up to $\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of
experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the
precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept
constant to within 15 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than
$\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit
frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard
deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise
spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and,
strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.

Abstract: Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric
fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by
thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of
intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly
understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin
magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band
geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two
key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs
thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry
curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These
intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic
insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet
CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our
results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and
provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin
caloritronic materials.
