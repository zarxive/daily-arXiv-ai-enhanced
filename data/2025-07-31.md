### [1] [Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22112)
*Yann Kiefer,Zijie Zhu,Lars Fischer,Samuel Jele,Marius Gächter,Giacomo Bisson,Konrad Viebahn,Tilman Esslinger*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  paper discusses a geometric two-qubit gate using fermionic atoms in optical lattices, demonstrating exceptional resilience and high fidelity, which could advance quantum computing by integrating transport methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Quantum computing presents significant challenges, and neutral atoms in optical lattices are considered promising platforms. However, collisional gates have issues with dynamic fine-tuning, leading to issues with quantum-geometry and statistics. The proposed geometric swap gate addresses these by utilizing doublon states and symmetries, offering a more robust solution.

Method:  The paper proposes a geometric two-qubit swap gate using transient population of fermionic doublon states in a dynamical optical lattice. It leverages quantum holonomy and symmetries like time-reversal and chiral symmetries to achieve protection against fluctuations. The experiment involves measurements across over 17,000 atom pairs with high fidelity.

Result:  The experiment achieves a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of 99.91(7)%, demonstrating the gate's robustness and scalability. This result shows significant progress towards scalable quantum processors.

Conclusion:  The work establishes a new approach for fault-tolerant quantum logic by transforming symmetries and quantum statistics into a practical resource, paving the way for advanced quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral
atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with
collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However,
previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically
fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and
statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we
propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate
by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a
dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with
fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a
geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate
mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and
inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is
further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian.
We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a
loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\%$ measured across the entire
system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently
developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the
way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces
a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and
quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.

Abstract: In recent decades the field of quantum computation has seen remarkable
development. While much progress has been made toward the realization of a
fully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still
many essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of
quantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring
fundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical
transition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify
results from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method
utilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble
of cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin
system Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are
able to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to
explore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover,
controlling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us
to investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the
classical limit. In particular, we emulate two models: the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
(LMG) Hamiltonian, and a closely related model, the Kicked Top. In the former
case, we show that our system undergoes a symmetry-breaking phase transition in
the expected parameter regime. In the latter, we explore two interesting
aspects: the formation of chaos, and a dynamically driven time crystal phase.
We will then discuss the advantages and limits of this approach.

### [3] [A comprehensive benchmark of an Ising machine on the Max-Cut problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22117)
*Salwa Shaglel,Markus Kirsch,Marten Winkler,Christian Münch,Stefan Walter,Fritz Schinkel,Martin Kliesch*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks the Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, comparing its performance with other heuristic algorithms for large QUBO instances up to 53,000 variables, measuring wall-clock time. The DA shows competitive results against the D-Wave system and QIS3, suggesting its viability for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems efficiently despite conventional quantum computers still being in development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is relevant because early quantum computing implementations, like the Digital Annealer, offer practical solutions for combinatorial optimization which are crucial in various industries. Comparing these implementations helps in understanding their potential without waiting for full quantum availability.

Method: The authors conducted a comprehensive benchmark using MQLib, a library of over 2,000 graphs, measuring the wall-clock time for each algorithm to assess performance. They specifically focused on the Max-Cut problem, which is a standard QUBO benchmark, to evaluate the DA's efficiency compared to other heuristic methods.

Result: The DA performed well, providing competitive results against established quantum-classical and quantum annealing systems, indicating that heuristic-based quantum computing approaches can handle large-scale problems effectively.

Conclusion: The benchmark demonstrates the potential of heuristic-based quantum computing, such as the Digital Annealer, to efficiently solve large QUBO problems, which is important for industries reliant on combinatorial optimization without full quantum hardware availability.

Abstract: QUBO formulations of combinatorial optimization problems allow for solving
them using various quantum heuristics. While large-scale quantum computations
are currently still out of reach, we can already numerically test such QUBO
formulations on a perhaps surprisingly large scale. In this work, we benchmark
Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) on the Max-Cut problem, which captures the main
complexity of the QUBO problem. We make a comprehensive benchmark against
leading other heuristic algorithms on graphs with up to 53,000 variables by
focusing on the wall-clock time. Moreover, we compare the DA performance
against published performance results of the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical
annealer and the recently proposed QIS3 heuristic. Based on performance
statistics for over 2,000 graphs from the MQLib, we find that the DA yields
competitive results. We hope that this benchmark demonstrates the extent to
which large QUBO instances can be heuristically solved today, yielding
consistent results across different solvers.

Conclusion: Krylov复杂度是分析量子相变的重要工具，适用于研究量子复杂系统。

Abstract: Understanding the complexity of quantum many-body systems has been attracting
much attention recently for its fundamental importance in characterizing
complex quantum phases beyond the scope of quantum entanglement. Here, we
investigate Krylov complexity in quantum percolation models (QPM) and establish
unconventional phase transitions emergent from the interplay of exponential
scaling of the Krylov complexity and the number of spanning clusters in QPM. We
develop a general scaling theory for Krylov complexity phase transitions (KCPT)
on QPM, and obtain exact results for the critical probabilities and exponents.
For non-interacting systems across diverse lattices (1D/2D/3D regular, Bethe,
and quasicrystals), our scaling theory reveals that the KCPT coincides with the
classical percolation transition. In contrast, for interacting systems, we find
the KCPT develops a generic separation from the percolation transition due to
the highly complex quantum many-body effects, which is analogous to the
Griffiths effect in the critical disorder phase transition. To test our
theoretical predictions, we provide a concrete protocol for measuring the
Krylov complexity, which is accessible to present experiments.

### [5] [Evaluation of Noise and Crosstalk in Neutral Atom Quantum Computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22140)
*Pranet Sharma,Yizhuo Tan,Konstantinos-Nikolaos Papadopoulos,Jakub Szefer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper assesses noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum computers, particularly in co-located environments. It examines how noise impacts simulation fidelity over time and finds that proximity increases crosstalk. A Moving Target Defense strategy is proposed to mitigate this issue, which proves effective for co-located simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neutral atom quantum computers are advancing as a possible platform for quantum simulations but face challenges like noise and crosstalk. Understanding these issues is important for optimizing their use in fields like optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics.

Method: The authors conduct an analysis of noise over time and its effects on simulation fidelity, and they experimentally or computationally evaluate the impact of spatial proximity on crosstalk while testing the MTD strategy.

Result: The study reveals that proximity enhances crosstalk, and the MTD strategy successfully mitigates this, allowing safe and reliable co-located simulations.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of MTD in addressing noise and crosstalk issues, highlighting the viability of co-located neutral atom quantum computing for practical applications.

Abstract: This work explores and evaluates noise and crosstalk in neutral atom quantum
computers. Neutral atom quantum computers are a promising platform for analog
Hamiltonian simulations, which rely on a sequence of time-dependent
Hamiltonians to model the dynamics of the larger system and are particularly
useful for problems in optimization, physics, and molecular dynamics. However,
the viability of running multiple simulations in a co-located or multi-tenant
environment is limited by noise and crosstalk. This work conducts an analysis
of how noise faced by simulations changes over time, and investigates the
effects of spatial co-location on simulation fidelity. Findings of this work
demonstrate that the close proximity of concurrent simulations can increase
crosstalk between them. To mitigate this issue, a Moving Target Defense (MTD)
strategy is proposed and evaluated. The results confirm that the MTD is a
viable technique for enabling safe and reliable co-location of simulations on
neutral atom quantum hardware.

Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of methanimine (CH2NH) and water
(H2O) molecules in an effort to locate conical intersections (CIs) using
variational quantum algorithms. Our approach implements and compares a range of
hybrid quantum-classical methods, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE), Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), VQE with Automatically-Adjusted
Constraints (VQE-AC), and we explore molecular configurations of interest using
a State-Average (SA) approach. Exact Diagonalization is employed as the
classical benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the quantum algorithms. We
perform simulations across a range of molecular geometries, basis sets, and
active spaces to compare each algorithm's performance and accuracy, and to
enhance the detectability of CIs. This work confirms the quantum variational
algorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules,
as long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen.
We also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing
excited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good
agreement within desired regions.

Abstract: Quantum evolutions are often non-unitary and in such cases, they are
frequently regarded as lossy. Such lossiness, however, does not necessarily
persist throughout the evolution, and there can often be intermediate
time-spans during which information ebbs in the environment to re-flood the
system -- an event known as information backflow. This phenomenon serves as a
well-established and sufficient indicator of non-Markovian behavior of open
quantum dynamics. Nevertheless, not all non-Markovian dynamics exhibit such
backflow. We find that when interference is allowed between two quantum
evolutions that individually generate non-Markovianity and yet do not exhibit
information backflow, it becomes possible to retrieve information from the
environment. Furthermore, we show that this setup involving
coherently-controlled quantum operation trajectories provides enhanced
performance and is more robust compared to an alternate coherently-controlled
arrangement of the quantum switch.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a molecular nanomagnet system using Yb(trensal) to demonstrate entanglement between an electronic spin qubit and a nuclear spin qudit, verifies Bell inequalities violation, and proposes a method for studying qudit-qudit entanglement using a spin trimer.


<details>

Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in exploring entanglement in quantum systems, particularly using molecular nanomagnets, to understand quantum spin systems and their applications in quantum information.

Method: The research employs an optimized pulse sequence and numerical simulations incorporating experimental decoherence to validate Bell inequalities in the qubit-qudit system and proposes a spin trimer setup for qudit entanglement.

Result: The violation of generalized Bell inequalities is shown to be robust across various parameters, and a feasible method for qudit entanglement study is suggested through the spin trimer scheme.

Conclusion: The system exhibits robust entanglement suitable for quantum information applications and offers a novel setup for extending entanglement studies to higher-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We show that Yb(trensal) molecular nanomagnet, embedding an electronic spin
qubit coupled to a nuclear spin qudit, provides an ideal platform to probe
entanglement in a qubit-qudit system.This is demonstrated by developing an
optimized pulse sequence to show violation of generalized Bell inequalities and
by performing realistic numerical simulations including experimentally measured
decoherence. We find that the inequalities are safely violated in a wide range
of parameters, proving the robustness of entanglement in the investigated
system. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to study qudit-qudit entanglement on a
molecular spin trimer, in which two spins 3/2 are linked via an interposed
switch to turn on and off their mutual interaction.

Abstract: Identifying phase transition points is a fundamental challenge in condensed
matter physics, particularly for transitions driven by quantum interference
effects, such as Anderson and many-body localization. Recent studies have
demonstrated that quantum coherence provides an effective means of detecting
localization transitions, offering a practical alternative to full quantum
state tomography and related approaches. Building on this idea, we investigate
localization transitions through complementarity relations that connect local
predictability, local coherence, and entanglement in bipartite pure states. Our
results show that predictability serves as a robust and efficient marker for
localization transitions. Crucially, its experimental determination requires
exponentially fewer measurements than coherence or entanglement, making it a
powerful tool for probing quantum phase transitions.

### [10] [Fragmented exceptional points and their bulk and edge realizations in lattice models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22158)
*Subhajyoti Bid,Henning Schomerus*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Exceptional points (EPs) are a key feature in non-Hermitian systems, but this paper extends the understanding to fragmented exceptional points (FEPs), which occur when eigenvectors are only partially degenerate. The authors devise a method to design systems with FEPs in their bulk and edge spectra, leveraging non-Hermitian versions of lattice models, both 2D and 3D, such as a Lieb lattice and a higher-order Dirac semimetal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of non-Hermitian systems has advanced in recent years, particularly with EPs being well-understood. However, the complexity of systems with more intricate degeneracies, such as FEPs, presents challenges. This paper addresses this gap by aiming to characterize and design FEPs systematically.

Method: The authors use an efficient algebraic approach to provide precise conditions for FEPs that can be directly evaluated from a model Hamiltonian. This allows for the free design of systems with FEPs in their bulk and edge spectra.

Result: The paper demonstrates that by using non-Hermitian lattice models, FEPs can be induced in both the bulk and edge spectra. The algebraic approach simplifies the identification and construction of these points, offering a practical method for future research.

Conclusion: This work broadens the understanding of non-Hermitian systems by unraveling the potential of FEPs and provides a methodology for designing systems with FEPs, opening new avenues in non-Hermitian physics and applications in materials science and photonics.

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are spectral defects displayed by non-Hermitian
systems in which multiple degenerate eigenvalues share a single eigenvector.
This distinctive feature makes systems exhibiting EPs more sensitive to
external perturbations than their Hermitian counterparts, where degeneracies
are nondefective diabolic points. In contrast to these widely studied cases,
more complex non-Hermitian degeneracies in which the eigenvectors are only
partially degenerate are poorly understood. Here, we characterize these
fragmented exceptional points (FEPs) systematically from a physical
perspective, and demonstrate how they can be induced into the bulk and edge
spectrum of two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattice models, exemplified
by non-Hermitian versions of a Lieb lattice and a higher-order topological
Dirac semimetal. The design of the systems is facilitated by an efficient
algebraic approach within which we provide precise conditions for FEPs that can
be evaluated directly from a given model Hamiltonian. The free design of FEPs
significantly opens up a new frontier for non-Hermitian physics and expands the
scope for designing systems with unconventional response characteristics.

### [11] [Quantum optical experiments towards atom-photon entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22166)
*Markus Weber*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a successful Bell test by entangling a single atom with a photon, closing detection and locality loopholes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome significant loopholes in previous Bell tests by utilizing entanglement between an atom and a photon, demonstrating the EPR paradox.

Method: An atom is optically trapped and excited, emitting a photon with equal probability into two decay channels, creating a maximally entangled state between the atom's spin and photon polarization.

Result: The experiment achieved high entanglement fidelity (0.82) and successfully confirmed Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement without loopholes.

Conclusion: This work provides strong evidence for quantum mechanics' non-locality and validates foundational aspects of quantum theory.

Abstract: In 1935 EPR used the assumption of local realism to conclude in a
Gedankenexperiment with two entangled particles that quantum mechanics is not
complete. Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby
experimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and
local-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are
consistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But
all these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation
of the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is
entanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because
it allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The
resulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection
efficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing
detection and locality loopholes.
  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of
entanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted
photon. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a
state which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay
a photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.
This accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the
emitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.
Because these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom
indistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the
polarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate
correlation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and
the internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the
generated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82.

Conclusion: 复杂度参数是一个有效的工具来识别量子相变，特别是对于多体局部化与量子热化之间的转变。这为深入理解复杂量子系统提供了新的视角。以及在量子计算和信息处理中可能有实践意义。

Abstract: The complexity of $n$-qubit and many body systems is investigated. In case of
an $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is
identified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of
the Shannon-entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect
of the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e.
classical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with
probability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate
off-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both
cases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most
quantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body
systems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body
random interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional
Heisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting
many body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the
cross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum
chaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the
thermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the
survival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results
show that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann
entropy and the R\'enyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative
parameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the
otherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum
chaos or ergodic behavior.

Abstract: The cubic phase state constitutes a nonlinear resource that is essential for
universal quantum computing protocols. However, constructing such non-classical
states faces many challenges. In this work, we present a protocol for
generating a cubic phase state with high fidelity. The protocol is based on an
interferometer scheme assisted by a detection operation. To find the proper set
of parameters that results in both high fidelity and high detection
probability, we provide a numerical multiparameter optimization. We investigate
a broad range of target states and study how parameter imperfections influence
fidelity.

*Holger F. Hofmann*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a characterization method using a five-stage interferometer to classify pure states in a three-dimensional Hilbert space based on non-classical correlations in negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum effects as the number of paths in interferometers increases requires a new method to characterize quantum states.

Method: The authors propose using a five-stage interferometer and analyze the orthogonality of states representing different measurement contexts to classify pure states in a three-dimensional Hilbert space.

Result: The classification allows for distinguishing pure states by the non-classical correlations in negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.

Conclusion: A new interferometric classification method provides a clearer understanding of non-classical correlations in quantum states.

Abstract: Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle
interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical
phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the
increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space
makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties
that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a
characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently
introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts
(Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations
between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used
to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to
the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative
Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.

Conclusion: 该方法在量子模拟中提高效率且保持了复杂度。

Abstract: We study algorithmic error mitigation via Richardson-style extrapolation for
quantum simulations of open quantum systems modelled by the Lindblad equation.
Focusing on two specific first-order quantum algorithms, we perform a
backward-error analysis to obtain a step-size expansion of the density operator
with explicit coefficient bounds. These bounds supply the necessary smoothness
for analyzing Richardson extrapolation, allowing us to bound both the
deterministic bias and the shot-noise variance that arise in post-processing.
For a Lindblad dynamics with generator bounded by $l$, our main theorem shows
that an $n=\Omega (\log(1/\varepsilon))$-point extrapolator reduces the maximum
circuit depth needed for accuracy $\varepsilon$ from polynomial $\mathcal{O}
((lT)^{2}/\varepsilon)$ to polylogarithmic $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2} \log l
\log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ scaling, an exponential improvement in~$1/\varepsilon$,
while keeping sampling complexity to the standard $1/\varepsilon^2$ level, thus
extending such results for Hamiltonian simulations to Lindblad simulations.
Several numerical experiments illustrate the practical viability of the method.

### [17] [Multipartite correlation measures and framework for multipartite quantum resources theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22348)
*Taotao Yan,Jinchuan Hou,Xiaofei Qi,Kan He*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a revised framework for multipartite quantum resource theory (QRT), emphasizing true multipartite quantum correlations (MQC) measures. These measures must meet several criteria, including unification, hierarchy, symmetry, and compatibility with free operations. The paper validates several multipartite quantum resources using this framework and discusses monogamy relations for symmetric MQCs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for a more robust theoretical framework for understanding and quantifying multipartite quantum correlations, which are crucial for quantum information processing and quantum resource theories. It aims to correct existing flaws in the current QRT framework and provide a more comprehensive and systematic approach to identifying and measuring these correlations.

Method: The authors developed a systematic methodology that first outlines the requirements for valid multipartite quantum resource measures, then evaluates each proposed quantum resource against these criteria. They validated each resource by checking whether they satisfy all the necessary conditions, such as non-negativity, faithfulness, non-increasing under free operations, unification, and hierarchy. Additionally, they explored symmetry properties for symmetric MQCs and established monogamy relations to assess the distribution of these correlations.

Result: The study successfully identified several multipartite quantum resources, including multipartite entanglement, $k$-entanglement, $k$-partite entanglement, multipartite non-PPT, multipartite coherence, and others. It established that multipartite steering is an asymmetric resource and provided monogamy relations for symmetric MQCs, thereby strengthening the foundation for quantum resource management and utilization.

Conclusion: This paper significantly advances the field of multipartite quantum resource theory by providing a rigorous framework for multipartite quantum correlations. The findings ensure proper identification and quantification of these resources, which are essential for advancing quantum information processing technologies and quantum communication networks.

Abstract: In recent years, it has been recognized that properties of multipartite
physical systems, such as multipartite entanglement, can be considered as
important resources for quantum information and other areas of physics.
However, the current framework of multipartite quantum resource theory is
flawed. In this paper, we propose a more reasonable framework for multipartite
quantum resource theory, with a particular focus on investigating true
multipartite quantum correlation (MQC) measures. Beyond satisfying the
conventional requirements of non-negativity, faithfulness, and non-increasing
trend under free operations, these measures must also meet the unification and
hierarchy conditions. We find that the true measures of different MQCs exhibit
distinct hierarchy conditions based on their inherent characteristics.
Additionally, the true MQC measures should also satisfy the symmetry for
symmetric MQCs. Based on this framework, we verify that multipartite
entanglement, $k$-entanglement, $k$-partite entanglement, multipartite non-PPT,
multipartite coherence, multipartite imaginarity, multipartite multi-mode
Gaussian non-product correlation, multipartite multi-mode Gaussian imaginarity,
and multipartite single-mode Gaussian coherence are all multipartite quantum
resources. We also show that, multipartite steering is an asymmetric
multipartite quantum resource. Finally, the monogamy relations for true
measures of symmetric MQCs are discussed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子编码和噪声估计是量子计算中的关键问题。向量编码是一种重要的局部量子编码方式，研究噪声参数的最优探测器有助于提高编码效率和准确性。

Method: 研究通过分析向量编码的连续交换性，探讨最优探测器的纠缠结构和量。通过不同去极化强度和多比特纠缠度量，得出系统性结论。

Result: 发现最优探测器通常为纠缠态，两比特时随着去极化强度增加，最优纠缠呈阶梯式减少。多比特情况下，阶梯特性取决于纠缠度量选择。极端情况下，去极化高时仅全乘积态最优。两比特bit-Flip信道中，连续交换性使全乘积态足够。

Conclusion: 量子编码过程的最优探测器取决于系统的参数，纠缠结构对编码性能至关重要。研究结果为设计高效量子编码策略提供了参考。

Abstract: We ask whether the optimal probe is entangled, and if so, what is its
character and amount, for estimating the noise parameter of a large class of
local quantum encoding processes that we refer to as vector encoding, examples
of which include the local depolarizing and bit-flip channels. We first
establish that vector encoding is invariably ``continuously commutative'' for
optimal probes. We utilize this result to deal with the queries about
entanglement in the optimal probe. We show that for estimating noise extent of
the two-party arbitrary-dimensional local depolarizing channel, there is a
descending staircase of optimal-probe entanglement for increasing depolarizing
strength. For the multi-qubit case, the analysis again leads to a staircase,
but which can now be monotonic or not, depending on the multiparty entanglement
measure used. We also find that when sufficiently high depolarizing noise is to
be estimated, fully product multiparty states are the only choice for being
optimal probes. In many cases, for even moderately high depolarizing noise,
fully product states are optimal. For two-qubit local bit-flip channels, the
continuous commutativity of the channel and optimal probe implies that a
product state suffices for obtaining the optimal precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子计算领域中的QPE算法在资源需求上过于高，尤其是在目前的NISQ设备上应用受限，因此找到一种更高效的QPE变体是关键。

Method: AWQPE利用了m>1个独立的控制量子比特块，分别估计多个相位位，减少迭代次数，并结合并行化和LSB到MSB纠错机制以提高准确性。

Result: 数值模拟显示AWQPE在准确性和资源效率之间找到了平衡，特别适合NISQ平台。

Conclusion: AWQPE为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案，适用于当前的量子计算设备。

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm in quantum
computing, with applications ranging from integer factorization to quantum
chemistry simulations. However, the resource demands of standard QPE, which
require a large number of coherent qubits and deep circuits, pose significant
challenges for current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. In this
work, we introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Phase Estimation (AWQPE)
algorithm, a novel method designed to address the limitations of standard QPE.
AWQPE utilizes small, independent blocks of $m > 1$ control qubits to estimate
multiple phase bits simultaneously within a "window,'' thereby significantly
reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a desired precision.
These independent blocks are amenable to parallelization and, when combined
with a robust least-significant-bit (LSB) to most-significant-bit (MSB)
ambiguity resolution mechanism, enhance the algorithm's accuracy while
mitigating the risk of error propagation. Our numerical simulations demonstrate
AWQPE's accuracy and robustness, showcasing a distinct balance between resource
efficiency and computational speed. This makes AWQPE particularly well-suited
for near-term quantum platforms.

### [20] [Scalable and (quantum-accessible) adaptive pseudorandom quantum states and pseudorandom function-like quantum state generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22535)
*Rishabh Batra,Zhili Chen,Rahul Jain,YaoNan Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces scalable pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) and function-like quantum states (PRFS) that don't introduce environmental correlations and can be constructed from quantum-secure one-way functions. It also implies several cryptographic primitives, aiding in the simplification of quantum cryptography tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the need for scalable and secure quantum cryptographic primitives, particularly in environments where traditional quantum-secure one-way functions might not suffice.

Method: The authors propose an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states with low trace distance from Haar-random states, leading to scalable PRS and PRFS constructions. They utilize quantum-secure one-way functions and avoid environmental entanglement, enabling adaptive PRFS.

Result: The resulting PRFS allow for the creation of various cryptographic primitives like long-input, short-input, short-output, and adaptive PRFS, which contribute to a simplified toolkit in quantum cryptography.

Conclusion: The work provides new tools for constructing scalable and adaptive quantum-secure cryptographic primitives, enhancing the toolkit for quantum cryptography.

Abstract: Pseudorandom quantum states (PRS) and pseudorandom function-like quantum
state (PRFS) generators are quantum analogues of pseudorandom generators and
pseudorandom functions. It is known that PRS (and PRFS) can exist even if BQP =
QMA (relative to a quantum oracle) or if P = NP (relative to a classical
oracle), which does not allow for the existence of one-way functions (relative
to these oracles). Hence, these are potentially weaker objects than
quantum-secure one-way functions, which can be used to do quantum cryptography.
A desirable property of PRS and PRFS constructions is scalability, which
ensures that the security parameter $\lambda$ (which determines
indistinguishability from their Haar-random counterparts) is much larger than
$n$ (the number of qubits of the output states). This may be important in some
applications where PRS and PRFS primitives are used.
  We present an isometric procedure to prepare quantum states that can be
arbitrarily random (i.e., the trace distance from the Haar-random state can be
arbitrarily small for the true random case, or the distinguishing advantage can
be arbitrarily small for the pseudorandom case). Our procedure provides a new
method for scalable PRS that introduces no entanglement or correlations with
the environment. This naturally gives the first construction for scalable and
(quantum-accessible) adaptive PRFS assuming quantum-secure one-way functions.
Our PRFS construction implies various primitives, including long-input PRFS,
short-input PRFS, short-output PRFS, non-adaptive PRFS, and
classical-accessible adaptive PRFS. This new construction may be helpful in
some simplification of the microcrypt zoo.

Abstract: Light detection and ranging is a key technology for a number of applications,
from relatively simple distance ranging to environmental monitoring. When
dealing with low photon numbers an important issue is the improvement of the
signal- to-noise-ratio, which is severely affected by external sources whose
emission is captured by the detection apparatus. In this paper, we present an
extension of the technique developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 203601] to the
effects caused by the propagation of light through a turbulent media, as well
as the detection through photon counting devices bearing imperfections in terms
of efficiency and number resolution. Our results indicate that even less
performing technology can result in a useful detection scheme.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 2D framework for coalgebra and bialgebra structures, extending Hopf algebras, and applies it to quantum groups, including U_q[su(2)], with implications for tensor network states like PEPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to extend the algebraic structures of Hopf algebras beyond 1D to higher dimensions, which is relevant for quantum many-body systems and potentially introduces new mathematical tools for quantum physics.

Method: The authors construct 2D coproducts using horizontal and vertical maps, ensuring compatibility and associativity, leading to the definition of 2D bialgebras. They provide examples, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions, and adapt it for quantum groups. The approach also involves tensor network states, specifically PEPS, which are given 2D coalgebra structures with appropriate boundary conditions.

Result: The paper presents a novel framework for defining coalgebraic structures in 2D, demonstrating applications to quantum groups and their generalizations. It also shows how PEPS and similar tensor network states can be understood within this framework, bridging algebraic structures with quantum many-body physics.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for integrating Hopf algebra theory into higher-dimensional quantum systems, potentially influencing the study of quantum symmetries and their applications in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory.

Abstract: We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on
two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf
algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our
construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical
maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the
consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several
examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired
constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf
algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum
group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its
generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix
satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally,
we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D
coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions.
Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed
quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially
connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical
symmetries in quantum many-body physics.

### [23] [Matrix product states as thin torus limits of conformal correlators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22735)
*Adrián Franco-Rubio,J. Ignacio Cirac,Germán Sierra*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new family of matrix product states inspired by conformal field theories, which reduces to known ground states in specific limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are exploring new approaches to construct matrix product states (MPS) for quantum lattice models, using insights from conformal field theory (CFT). This is relevant because MPS are powerful tools for studying the ground states and low-energy properties of quantum spin systems, and leveraging CFT could provide a systematic way to construct these states.

Method: The methodology involves constructing one-parameter families of spin chain wavefunctions using CFT correlators on a torus, parameterized by τ. The analysis focuses on the cylinder limit (τ → ∞) and the thin torus limit (τ → 0). In the thin torus limit, these wavefunctions reduce to finite bond dimension MPS, which are then compared to known ground states.

Result: The study finds that in the thin torus limit, the constructed wavefunctions reduce to well-known MPS states, such as the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT models. This suggests that the proposed method can systematically generate MPS representations of ground states for various quantum spin chains.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel framework for constructing matrix product states by connecting them to conformal field theory. By deriving specific instances in different limits, the work offers a promising pathway to understand and compute ground states of complex quantum systems through the lens of CFT.

Abstract: We introduce one-parameter families of spin chain ansatz wavefunctions
constructed from chiral conformal field theory correlators on a torus, with the
modular parameter $\tau$ serving as the deformation parameter. In the cylinder
limit $\tau\to\infty$, these wavefunctions reduce to infinite dimensional
matrix product states. In contrast, in the thin torus limit $\tau\to0$, they
become finite bond dimension matrix product states (MPS). Focusing on families
derived from the SU(2)$_1$ and SU(2)$_2$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models, we show
that in the thin torus limit they reproduce known MPS ground states, such as
those of the Majumdar-Ghosh and AKLT spin chains.

Abstract: In the context of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), selecting an
appropriate ansatz is crucial for efficient problem-solving. Hamiltonian
expressibility has been introduced as a metric to quantify a circuit's ability
to uniformly explore the energy landscape associated with a Hamiltonian ground
state search problem. However, its influence on solution quality remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we estimate the Hamiltonian expressibility of
a well-defined set of circuits applied to various Hamiltonians using a Monte
Carlo-based approach. We analyze how ansatz depth influences expressibility and
identify the most and least expressive circuits across different problem types.
We then train each ansatz using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and
analyze the correlation between solution quality and expressibility.Our results
indicate that, under ideal or low-noise conditions and particularly for
small-scale problems, ans\"atze with high Hamiltonian expressibility yield
better performance for problems with non-diagonal Hamiltonians and
superposition-state solutions. Conversely, circuits with low expressibility are
more effective for problems whose solutions are basis states, including those
defined by diagonal Hamiltonians. Under noisy conditions, low-expressibility
circuits remain preferable for basis-state problems, while intermediate
expressibility yields better results for some problems involving
superposition-state solutions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Krylov quantum diagonalization methods have emerged as a promising use case
for quantum computers. However, many existing implementations rely on
controlled operations, which pose challenges to near-term quantum hardware. We
introduce a novel protocol, which we call Krylov Time Reversal (KTR), which
avoids these bottlenecks by exploiting the time-reversal symmetry in
Hamiltonian evolution. Using symmetric time dynamics, we show that it is
possible to recover real-valued Krylov matrix elements, which significantly
reduces the circuit depth and enhances compatibility with shallow quantum
architectures. We validate our method through numerical simulations on
paradigmatic Hamiltonians exhibiting time-reversal symmetry, including the
transverse-field Ising model and a lattice gauge theory, demonstrating accurate
spectral estimation and favorable circuit constructions.

Abstract: Quantum state preparation is an important subroutine in many quantum
algorithms. The goal is to encode classical information directly to the quantum
state so that it is possible to leverage quantum algorithms for data
processing. However, quantum state preparation of arbitrary states scales
exponentially in the number of two-qubit gates, and this makes quantum state
preparation a very difficult task on quantum computers, especially on near-term
noisy devices. This represents a major challenge in achieving quantum
advantage. We present and analyze a novel two-step state preparation method
where we first minimize the entanglement entropy of the target quantum state,
thus transforming the state to one that is easier to prepare. The state with
reduced entanglement entropy is then represented as a matrix product state,
resulting in a high accuracy preparation of the target state. Our method is
suitable for NISQ devices and we give rigorous lower bounds on the accuracy of
the prepared state in terms of the entanglement entropy and demonstrate
cutting-edge performance across a collection of benchmark states.

Abstract: We introduce a novel non-equilibrium phase -- the quantum many-body scar
(QMBS) phase -- that emerges in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics when scarred
wavefunctions are selectively stabilized via non-Hermitian driving. Projective
measurements, or non-Hermitian counterparts, preferentially reinforce QMBS,
counteracting the entropy growth that drives thermalization. As a result,
atypical, high-energy scarred wavefunctions that are negligible in the
long-time dynamics of closed systems become non-equilibrium steady states. We
establish the existence of the QMBS phase and its sharp, first-order phase
transition from an ergodic thermal phase, through both analytical arguments and
numerical simulations of three representative models: a random quantum circuit
model, the $SU(q)$ spin model, and the paradigmatic spin-1 XY model.

Abstract: This paper presents a detailed theoretical review of the amplification
process in Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), which are crucial for
quantum-limited signal amplification in superconducting circuits. The paper
begins by outlining the principles of parametric amplification, focusing on how
a strong classical pump interacts with the nonlinear Josephson medium in

Motivation: The paper is focused on developing advanced quantum computing architectures that require specific Gaussian operations, such as two-mode squeezing. achieving universal control over quantum states is essential for various quantum applications, including computation and sensing. this work provides a new approach through conditional squeezing, potentially offering improvements over traditional methods.

Method: the method involves using a Rabi-driven qubit that is dispersively coupled to one or two harmonic oscillators.

Conclusion: this study presents a promising new paradigm for conditionally controlling photonic states, which could strengthen quantum computing capabilities and advance quantum sensing applications by enabling more precise and versatile Gaussian operations.

Abstract: Advanced bosonic quantum computing architectures demand nonlocal Gaussian
operations such as two-mode squeezing to unlock universal control, enable
entanglement generation, and implement logical operations across distributed
modes. This work presents a novel method for generating conditional squeezing
using a Rabi-driven qubit dispersively coupled to one or two harmonic
oscillators. A proof that this enables universal control over bosonic modes is
provided, expanding the toolkit for continuous-variable quantum information
processing. Using modulated Jaynes-Cummings interactions in circuit QED, the
simulation predicts intra-cavity squeezing of 13dB (single-mode), 4dB
(superimposed single-mode), and 12dB (two-mode), with the latter two yet to be
demonstrated experimentally. These results establish a new paradigm for

### [32] [Genuine multipartite entanglement as a probe of many-body localization in disordered spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22795)
*Triyas Sapui,Keshav Das Agarwal,Tanoy Kanti Konar,Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju,Aditi Sen De*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper shows that multipartite entanglement can approach maximum in the ergodic phase of a disordered quantum spin model, whereas it vanishes in the MBL phase. They use a Heisenberg chain with random fields and DM interactions to study this transition and find that DM, especially three-body, stabilizes the thermal phase and delays MBL transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of quantum phase transitions, particularly between ergodic and many-body localized phases, is crucial for advancing quantum information and condensed matter physics.

Method: They analyze a disordered Heisenberg spin chain with DM interactions using static eigenstates and dynamical evolution from a Neel state to study GME transitions.

Result: GME serves as an efficient indicator for MBL transition with transition points matching other indicators. DM, especially three-body, delays the MBL transition.

Conclusion: GME is a robust probe for detecting MBL transitions, with DM interactions playing a significant role in stabilizing the thermal phase.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the quenched average genuine multipartite entanglement
(GME) can approach its maximum value in the ergodic phase of a disordered
quantum spin model. In contrast, GME vanishes in the many-body localized (MBL)
phase, both in equilibrium and in the long-time dynamical steady state,
indicating a lack of useful entanglement in the localized regime. To establish
this, we analyze the disordered Heisenberg spin chain subjected to a random
magnetic field and incorporating two- and three-body Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)
interactions. We exhibit that the behavior of GME, in both static eigenstates
and in dynamically evolved states from an initial Neel configuration, serves as
a reliable indicator of the critical disorder strength required for the
ergodic-to-MBL transition. The identified transition point aligns well with
standard indicators such as the gap ratio and correlation length. Moreover, we
find that the presence of DM interactions, particularly the three-body one,
significantly stabilizes the thermal phase and delays the onset of
localization. This shift in the transition point is consistently reflected in
both static and dynamical analyses, reinforcing GME as a robust probe for MBL
transitions.

Abstract: Developing hardware-efficient implementations of quantum algorithms is
crucial in the NISQ era to achieve practical quantum advantage. Here, we
construct a generic quantum solver for NP problems based on Grover's search

We design the quantum oracles in the search algorithm using parallelizable
single-qubit and multi-qubit entangling gates in the Rydberg atom system,
yielding a unified framework for solving a broad class of NP problems with
provable quadratic quantum speedup. We analyze the experimental resource
requirements considering the unique qubit connectivity of the dynamically
reconfigurable qubits in the optical tweezer array. The required qubit number
scales linearly with the problem size, representing a significant improvement
over existing Rydberg-based quantum annealing approaches that incur quadratic
overhead. These results provide a concrete roadmap for future experimental
efforts towards demonstrating quantum advantage in NP problem solving using
Rydberg atomic systems. Our construction indicates that atomic qubits offer
favorable circuit depth scaling compared to quantum processors with fixed local
connectivity.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, proving that Trotterization achieves a 1/4-order convergence rate with explicit polynomial dependence on particle count. The result is optimal, addressing challenges from many-body structure and Coulomb potential's singular nature using a unified framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient simulation methods are essential for understanding complex quantum systems in physics, chemistry, and quantum computing. Proving the convergence rate of a simulation technique, especially for Coulomb interactions, provides a theoretical foundation for its practical application and helps determine its scalability.

Method: The authors analyze the convergence rate of the Trotterization method applied to unbounded Hamiltonians with Coulomb interactions. They consider the many-body structure and the singular nature of Coulomb potentials, using techniques that differ from prior studies to establish a 1/4-order convergence rate with explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles.

Result: The study shows that Trotterization achieves a 1/4-order convergence for Coulomb interactions, which is optimal as this rate cannot be improved based on prior research. The result holds for any initial wavefunction within the Hamiltonian's domain.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of Trotterization for Coulomb-interacting systems, showing that it is an efficient and scalable method, which is validated by the optimal 1/4-order convergence rate with clear polynomial scaling relative to the number of particles.

Abstract: Efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems is central to advances in
physics, chemistry, and quantum computing, with a key question being whether
the simulation cost scales polynomially with the system size. In this work, we
analyze many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, which are
fundamental to electronic and molecular systems. We prove that Trotterization
for such unbounded Hamiltonians achieves a $1/4$-order convergence rate, with
explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles. The result holds for
all initial wavefunctions in the domain of the Hamiltonian, and the $1/4$-order
convergence rate is optimal, as previous studies have shown that it can be
saturated by a specific initial eigenstate. The main challenges arise from the
many-body structure and the singular nature of the Coulomb potential. Our proof
strategy differs from prior state-of-the-art Trotter analyses, addressing both
difficulties in a unified framework.

### [36] [Gain on ground state of quantum system for truly $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22728)
*Bing-Bing Liu,Shi-Lei Su*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses the challenge of achieving the imaginary gain term in a PT-symmetric quantum system and proposes a method using effective operator and continuous measurement to overcome it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PT-symmetric systems are important in quantum physics and engineering quantum resources is crucial for quantum information. Researchers need ways to realize such systems experimentally.

Method: The authors propose using the Sørensen-Reiter effective operator method combined with the Wiseman-Milburn master equation for continuous measurement and feedback to implement the required gain term.

Result: They validate this method with a theoretical demonstration of PT symmetry restoration for the driven-damped qubit system.

Conclusion: This approach offers a feasible pathway for constructing true PT-symmetric quantum devices, supporting future quantum technologies.

Abstract: For a truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum system, the conventional
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is $H = H_{\rm drive} -i\gamma|1\rangle\langle1| +
i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$, where $\Omega$ and $\gamma$ are real parameters.
The three terms respectively represent coherent coupling, loss (on state
$|1\rangle$), and gain (on state $|0\rangle$). However, realizing the gain term
$+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$ has remained an outstanding challenge for quantum
system, especially on ground state -- no theoretical or experimental schemes
have definitively demonstrated its achievement. While systems omitting this
gain term can exhibit a passively $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric energy spectrum
(featuring a parallel imaginary shift) and display related phenomena, they fail
to capture the full physical behavior and unique properties inherent to truly
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems. In this manuscript, we propose a method to
achieve effective gain on the ground state $|0\rangle$
($+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$) after averaging all trajectories, by integrating
the S{\o}rensen-Reiter effective operator method with the Wiseman-Milburn
master equation for continuous measurement and instantaneous feedback control
after averaging the evolution
  over all trajectories. This approach provides a possible pathway to
efficiently construct truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum devices, offering
a powerful platform for engineering quantum resources vital for quantum
information technology applications.

*Yuhao Wang,Xingjian Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates a violation of the joint exogeneity assumption in a quantum experiment, suggesting it's not as foundational as thought and challenges classical physics frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the joint exogeneity assumption and its implications for potential outcome models in both classical and quantum contexts.

Method: The authors used a quantum experiment to test joint exogeneity, comparing classical physics predictions with observed results.

Result: The experiment revealed a violation of joint exogeneity, particularly in quantum regimes not explainable by classical physics.

Conclusion: Joint exogeneity might not be as unassailable as previously believed, necessitating reevaluation of classical physics in certain quantum scenarios.

Abstract: In randomized experiments, the assumption of potential outcomes is usually
accompanied by the \emph{joint exogeneity} assumption. Although joint
exogeneity has faced criticism as a counterfactual assumption since its
proposal, no evidence has yet demonstrated its violation in randomized
experiments. In this paper, we reveal such a violation in a quantum experiment,
thereby falsifying this assumption, at least in regimes where classical physics
cannot provide a complete description. We further discuss its implications for
potential outcome modelling, from both practial and philosophical perspectives.

### [38] [Approximate combinatorial optimization with Rydberg atoms: the barrier of interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22761)
*Christian de Correc,Thomas Ayral,Corentin Bertrand*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of using analog quantum computing with Rydberg atoms for graph optimization, particularly in interpreting solutions for MIS problems beyond specific cases. They evaluated two correction strategies for embedding but found one too costly while the other degraded solution quality beyond practical limits. Hence, they conclude that scalable improvements are unlikely, suggesting heuristic approaches instead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of quantum computing in graph optimization, prompting a focus on interpretation methods for more general graph handling, which would help in advancing quantum algorithms.

Method: The authors evaluated two correction strategies for embedding in the Crossing Lattice method, analyzed their computational costs and solution qualities under realistic assumptions.

Result: One strategy was highly effective but exponentially expensive, while the other degraded solution quality significantly, making scalable improvements impractical.

Conclusion: The study concludes that achieving scalable improvements through Rydberg quantum computing is unlikely, thus heuristic methods are recommended for future research.

Abstract: Analog quantum computing with Rydberg atoms is seen as an avenue to solve
hard graph optimization problems, because they naturally encode the Maximum
Independent Set (MIS) problem on Unit-Disk (UD) graphs, a problem that admits
rather efficient approximation schemes on classical computers. Going beyond
UD-MIS to address generic graphs requires embedding schemes, typically with
chains of ancilla atoms, and an interpretation algorithm to map results back to
the original problem. However, interpreting approximate solutions obtained with
realistic quantum computers proves to be a difficult problem. As a case study,
we evaluate the ability of two interpretation strategies to correct errors in
the recently introduced Crossing Lattice embedding. We find that one strategy,
based on finding the closest embedding solution, leads to very high qualities,
albeit at an exponential cost. The second strategy, based on ignoring defective
regions of the embedding graph, is polynomial in the graph size, but it leads
to a degradation of the solution quality which is prohibitive under realistic
assumptions on the defect generation. Moreover, more favorable defect scalings
lead to a contradiction with well-known approximability conjectures. Therefore,
it is unlikely that a scalable and generic improvement in solution quality can
be achieved with Rydberg platforms -- thus moving the focus to heuristic
algorithms.

Abstract: We propose a physical system consisting of two optical cavities and a
two-level system (TLS), which can be viewed as a double single-sided cavity
system. The two cavities are crossed each other in a mutually perpendicular way
and are both single-sided. The TLS is coupled to the two cavities. The
universal input-output relation of the system, the reflection and transmission
coefficients are derived by exploiting the probability amplitude method. Then
by using the nitrogen-vacancy center instead of the TLS, we generate the
controlled-phase gate and the controlled-controlled-phase gate on the photon
qubits, with simple protocols that can be accomplished in both weak and strong
coupling regimes. The protocols are shown to give rise to high fidelities and
gate efficiencies.

Abstract: We analyze a system of three or more qubits collectively interacting with a

Our study focuses on the emergence of decoherence-free subspaces and the
genuine-entanglement dynamics. Specifically, we study the three qubit system in
detail, where the genuine entanglement is quantified through the convex roof
extension of negativity. By examining the transition between Markovian and
non-Markovian regimes, we reveal how the entanglement in the system evolves
under the influence of the environment. Notably, we observe transitions between
genuinely multi-qubit entangled and bi-separable states, including a revival of
entanglement even in the Markovian regime. These findings provide insights into
the robustness of quantum correlations and the conditions under which
decoherence-protected states can be sustained.

Motivation: This paper is crucial for advancing quantum computing in nuclear physics, as it addresses the exponential cost of classical simulations and the scalability of quantum approaches, which could enable practical applications in astrophysics and terrestrial experiments.

Method: They used product formulas and Quantum Signal Processing to simulate the LO pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization, achieving polynomial and logarithmic resource scaling respectively. They compared this to previous work in second quantization and found an exponential improvement.

Result: Simulations of low-energy nuclear scattering are feasible with  tens of millions of T gates and under a few hundred logical qubits, suggesting applicability on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for quantum simulations in nuclear physics, positioning quantum computing to tackle previously intractable nuclear dynamics problems efficiently.

Abstract: The study of real time dynamics of nuclear systems is of great importance to
provide theoretical predictions of cross sections relevant for both terrestrial
experiments as well as applications in astrophysics. First principles
simulations of these dynamical processes is however hindered by an exponential
cost in classical resources and the possibility of performing scalable
simulations using quantum computers is currently an active field of research.
In this work we provide the first complete characterization of the resource
requirements for studying nuclear dynamics with the full Leading Order (LO)
pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization employing simulation strategies
using both product formulas as well as Quantum Signal Processing. In
particular, we show that time evolution of such an Hamiltonian can be performed
with polynomial resources in the number of particles, and logarithmic resources
in the number of single-particle basis states. This result provides an
exponential improvement compared with previous work on the same Hamiltonian
model in second quantization. We find that interesting simulations for low
energy nuclear scattering could be achievable with tens of millions of T gates
and few hundred logical qubits suggesting that the study of simple nuclear
reactions could be amenable for early fault tolerant quantum platforms.

Abstract: Cluster states are a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum

nonlinear couplings between multiple frequency modes. The entanglement
structure is verified via frequency-resolved heterodyne detection of quadrature
nullifiers, confirming the target graph topology of the cluster state. Our
approach allows reconfigurability through the pumps spectrum and supports
scalability by leveraging the wide bandwidth and spatial homogeneity of the
JTWPA. This platform opens new avenues for scalable measurement-based quantum
information processing in the microwave domain, compatible with superconducting

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A quantum computing circuit is presented that approximates a single spin wave
quantum on a linear chain of spin 1/2 particles described by a Heisenberg
Hamiltonian. The circuit is a product state where each qubit represents a spin.
The spin wave motion is represented by opening the cone angle using Y rotations
and then adding progressive Z rotations along the chain to represent wave
propagation. We show analytically that this product state yields the correct
dispersion relation in the limit of an unbounded chain. This surprising
observation is confirmed using both a simulator and various quantum processors.
The quantum circuit calculation leads to insight into the connection between
classical and quantum descriptions of spin waves, and may also be useful for
characterizing the error in quantum processors.

Abstract: Understanding transport phenomena in quantum spin systems has long intrigued
physicists due to their potential applications in spintronic devices and spin
qubits. Here, using a superconducting-qubit-based transmon device, we show that
pre-fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation is reliable for studying
transport phenomena via spin-current autocorrelation function (ACF). While
quantum simulations of the spin-spin ACF have been used to probe spin
transport, methods based on the spin-current ACF have yet to be demonstrated
due to their high gate cost, despite offering more direct information relevant
to the transport properties. Overcoming the resource constraints set by
indirect measurement schemes like the Hadamard test, we showcase a direct
measurement scheme that utilizes non-unitary operations, in particular
mid-circuit measurements, to investigate spin transport for the 40-site 1D XXZ
Heisenberg model in the near-ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes.
We successfully reproduce the expected power-law behavior in the superdiffusive
regime and vanishing of the Drude weight in the diffusive regime.

Abstract: We show that the Schr\"odinger equation describes the ensemble mean dynamics
of solitons in a Galilean invariant field theory where we interpret solitons as
particles. On a zero background, solitons move classically, following Newton`s
second law, however, on a non-zero amplitude chaotic background, their momentum
and position fluctuate fulfilling an exact uncertainty relation, which give
rise to the emergence of quantum phenomena. The Schrodinger equation for the
ensemble of solitons is obtained from this exact uncertainty relation, and the
amplitude of the background fluctuations is what corresponds to the value of
$\hbar$. We confirm our analytical results running simulations of solitons
moving against a potential barrier and comparing the ensemble probabilities
with the predictions of the time dependent Schr\"odinger equation, providing a
deterministic version of the quantum tunneling effect. We conclude with a
discussion of how our theory does not present statistical independence between
measurement and experiment outcome.

Abstract: A quantum thermodynamic system can conserve non-commuting observables, but
the consequences of this phenomenon on relaxation are still not fully
understood. We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent
approach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We
extend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it
can accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables
without access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do
not require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus
providing an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this
approach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and
play a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of
observables. We show and numerically confirm that, due to charges'
non-commutativity, these weak values can be anomalous even at equilibrium,
which has been proven to be a proxy for non-classicality. Our work thus
uncovers a novel connection between the relaxation of observables under
non-commuting charges, weak values, and Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability
distributions.

Abstract: Magic-state resource theory is a fundamental framework with far-reaching
applications in quantum error correction and the classical simulation of
quantum systems. Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding
of magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,
nuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress
is the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible
magic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational
interpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this
work, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property
testing. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable
magic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state
becomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate
governed by the stabilizer entropy $M(\psi)$ and the number of available
copies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state
$k$-design, with an approximation error $\Theta(\exp(-M(\psi))$. Conversely, we
establish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state
from the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.
These results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes
the transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby
offering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a
quantum resource.

### [51] [Ambiguity-Aware Segmented Estimation of Mutual Coupling in Large RIS: Algorithm and Experimental Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22750)
*Philipp del Hougne*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an optimized algorithm for optimizing RIS in a wireless channel, successfully handling scalability challenges and ambiguities through three sequential problem-solving steps. However, the practical benefits are limited when relying on model-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of optimizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in wireless channels, which is increasingly important with the growth of 5G and beyond. The motivation stems from the need for efficient and scalable methods to handle mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements, which significantly affects channel performance.

Method: The method involves partitioning the RIS elements into groups and sequentially solving smaller estimation problems. The algorithm first estimates MIMO characteristics and group-specific MCs, then estimates intra-group and inter-group MCs, leveraging parallelization and efficient initialization where possible.

Result: The approach achieved a 40.5 dB accuracy compared to benchmark models, demonstrating the effectiveness of considering mutual coupling. However, model-based predictions showed a lack of reliability when relying solely on models without considering real-world variations.

Conclusion: While the proposed method improves upon existing models by accounting for mutual coupling, the practical benefits in real-world applications, especially in terms of improving performance metrics, are limited. This study highlights the critical need for more robust model-based prediction techniques.

Abstract: Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a
physics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation
of the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters
grows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability
challenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments
of the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully
handling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation
problem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition
the RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well
as the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate
the MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with
an already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between
each distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the
second and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can
furthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate
our algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a
rich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter
multiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark
models with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB,
respectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the
RIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with
the optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC
awareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we
observe that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of
model-based predictions of the expected performance.

TL;DR: This paper explains that certain stochastic wealth models lead to canonical or microcanonical distributions as steady states, noting that reversibility plays a significant role even in non-time reversible models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is likely written to provide a deeper theoretical understanding of wealth distribution models, possibly influencing policy or theoretical economics by showing how wealth can stabilize under specific stochastic dynamics.

Method: The paper uses mathematical analysis and examples to explore the behavior of these models, focusing on the relationships between reversibility, money games, and the resulting distributions.

Result: The models with random money transfers, even involving multiple agents, lead to canonical or microcanonical distributions as steady states when they are reversible. The paper also provides an explicit example where non-time reversible models still end up with these distributions.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper offers insights into the conditions under which wealth distributions in money games stabilize, emphasizing the role of reversibility in achieving canonical or microcanonical states, and provides an example showing that even without time symmetry, the distributions can still occur.

Abstract: This note explains why a large class of fair, or reversible "money games",
i.e., stochastic models of wealth redistribution among agents, lead to steady
states described by canonical and microcanonical distributions. The games
considered include, for example, ones where more than two agents can be
simultaneously involved in money transfers (similarly to many-body collisions
in chemical kinetics) and where amounts transferred between agents are random.
At the same time, money games that break time reversal symmetry can also lead
to the canonical/microcanonical distributions, as illustrated by an explicit
example.

Abstract: Spin-exchange collisions have been widely studied in recent years, and
various quantum-mechanical scattering approaches have been developed to
calculate the rates. However, these methods based on global knowledge of
wavefunctions can be computationally demanding and do not offer a simple
mechanistic interpretation. Here, we present a new semiclassical
transition-state theory (SCTST) derived from first principles to describe the
nonadiabatic transition between two states which differ only in their spins,
where classical TST and Landau--Zener theory fail. We apply our theory to
describe the spin-exchange collision between the nuclear spin of 3He and the
electronic spin of 23Na. SCTST reveals that the reaction proceeds via a
temperature-dependent transition state, determined by an intricate compromise
between minimizing the activation energy and maximizing the hyperfine coupling.
It further demonstrates the importance of quantum delocalization effects
prevalent in spin exchange even when tunneling is suppressed and successfully
explains the weak temperature dependence of the rate. Moreover, since it
depends only on local information at a single point, the computational cost is
significantly reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the challenges and solutions for using CW magnetrons in SRF accelerators, which could improve the efficiency and reduce the cost in RF heating applications, making it relevant for researchers in accelerator physics or RF technologies.

Method: The paper reviews PIC modeling and experimental results, focusing on techniques like injection locking and forced oscillation to control magnetron behavior and suppress noise.

Result: The techniques reviewed reduce noise and stabilize magnetrons, proving their suitability for SRF accelerators despite initial instability issues.

Conclusion: CW magnetrons can be effectively used in SRF accelerators with proper control methods, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional RF power sources.

Abstract: CW magnetrons, developed for industrial RF heaters, were suggested to feed RF
cavities of superconducting accelerators due to higher efficiency and lower
cost of RF power than provide traditionally used klystrons, IOTs or solid-state
amplifiers. RF amplifiers driven by a master oscillator serve as coherent RF
sources. CW magnetrons are regenerative RF auto generators with a huge
regenerative gain. This causes regenerative instability with a notable noise
when a magnetron operates as an auto generator i.e., with the anode voltage
above the threshold of self-excitation. Traditionally, an injection locking by
a small signal is used for phase stabilization of magnetrons. In this case CW
magnetrons with the injection-locked (coherent) oscillations generate a notable
level of noise. This may preclude use of CW magnetrons in this mode in the
Superconducting RF (SRF) accelerators. This paper reviews PIC modeling and
previously obtained experimental results for the operation and control of CW
magnetrons, which led to the development of techniques most suitable for
various SRF accelerators using forced RF oscillation of magnetrons, when the
magnetron is launched by an injected forcing signal, and regenerative noise is
suppressed.

Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) has long been recognized as a
significant source of longitudinal impedance driving microwave instability in
electron storage rings. In the pursuit of higher luminosity, next-generation
circular $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the few-GeV energy range, such as
B-factories and Tau-Charm factories, are being designed with low-emittance
beams and high beam currents. Damping wigglers are commonly introduced to
reduce damping times and control beam emittance. In this study, we
systematically investigate the impact of coherent wiggler radiation (CWR), a
specific form of CSR generated within wigglers, on beam stability in Tau-Charm
factories. We revisit the threshold conditions for CWR-induced microwave
instability and evaluate its effects under realistic lattice configurations of
collider rings. Furthermore, we examine theoretical models of longitudinal CWR
impedance and identify improved formulations that better capture its influence.
As an illustrative example, the developed CWR impedance models are applied to
simulate beam stability in the Super Tau-Charm Facility currently under design
in China.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the evaluation of the one-loop four-graviton scattering amplitude in type-II superstring theory exactly in α'. They combine insights into the ε prescription with Rademacher expansion to compute the amplitude in C++ and analyze its behavior. Their findings suggest discrepancies between explicit computation and saddle point analysis, hinting at additional saddle points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of scattering amplitudes in string theory is fundamental to understanding quantum gravity effects and the behavior of gravitons. This paper's focus on α' expansion provides insights into the high-energy regime, which is crucial for theories like the AdS/CFT correspondence and potential experimental signatures in high-energy physics experiments.

Method: The authors utilize string theory's ε prescription and a novel application of the Rademacher expansion for evaluating modular integrals. They implement this method in C++ for computational analysis, enabling precise calculations at finite α' and diverse kinematic scenarios.

Result: The computational results reveal discrepancies when compared to the saddle point analysis of Gross and Mende, suggesting the presence of additional saddle points beyond those traditionally considered. This indicates a more complex structure in the high-energy limit, which is important for refining models of quantum gravity and understanding string theory predictions.

Conclusion: The paper advances the theoretical framework for calculating scattering amplitudes in type-II superstring theory, highlighting the necessity to consider additional saddle points for a complete description. This work contributes to verifying the consistency of string theory with the AdS/CFT correspondence and its implications for high-energy physics research.

Abstract: We evaluate the one-loop four-graviton scattering amplitude in type-II
superstring theory exactly in $\alpha'$. This result is achieved by combining
physical insights into the $i\varepsilon$ prescription in string theory with a
new technical application of the Rademacher expansion of modular integrals. We
provide an implementation of our formula in $\texttt{C++}$ and use it to study
the behavior of the amplitude at finite $\alpha'$ and in different kinematic
regimes. Our analysis reveals a tension between explicit computations and the
saddle point analysis of Gross and Mende in the high-energy limit and suggests
the presence of additional saddle points.

Abstract: Quantum complexity of conformal field theory (CFT) states has recently gained
significant attention, both as a diagnostic tool in condensed matter systems
and in connection with holographic observables probing black hole interiors.
Previous studies have primarily focused on cases where all generators of the
conformal group contribute equally to the cost of building a circuit. In this
work, we present a general framework for studying the complexity of circuits in
generic Lie groups, where penalty factors assign relative weights to different
generators. Our approach constructs a metric on the coset space of quantum
states, induced from a (pseudo-)Riemannian norm on the space of unitary
circuits. The geodesics of this metric are interpreted as optimal circuits. The
method builds on the formalism of (pseudo-)Riemannian submersions and connects
naturally to other prescriptions in the literature, including cost function
minimization along stabilizer directions and constructions based on coadjoint
orbits. As a concrete application, we compute state complexity for states in
one- and two-dimensional CFTs. For specific choices of penalty factors, our
prescription yields a positive-definite metric with a viable interpretation as
complexity; in other cases, the resulting metric is indefinite. In the viable
regime, we derive analytic results when a specific penalty factor is turned
off, develop perturbative expansions for small values of the penalty factors,
and provide numerical results in the general case. We comment on the relation
of our measure of complexity to holography.

Method: They constructed a family of time-symmetric initial data with fixed boundary conditions, showing that this leads to an arbitrarily low ADM energy.

Result: They found that fixing the sizes of the circle and the minimal sphere results in a significant instability with negative energy configurations.

Conclusion: This suggests the standard Kaluza-Klein vacuum is more unstable than previously believed, potentially impacting the validity of these models in theoretical physics.

Abstract: We show that the ADM energy of a Kaluza-Klein bubble of nothing is unbounded
from below even if the size of the circle at infinity and the size of the
minimal sphere at the bubble are fixed. We demonstrate this by presenting a
family of explicit time-symmetric initial data satisfying these boundary
conditions with arbitrarily negative energy. In particular, this is true for
very small bubbles, which indicates that the standard Kaluza-Klein vacuum is
more unstable than previously thought.

Motivation: 研究者通过分析特定的R-对称超重力模型的结构，寻找新的成员并检查其完整性。

Method: 利用分析六维模型的结构、寻找乘积群及应用数学工具检查模型完整性的方法。

Result: 新发现模型存在缺陷，无法满足所有条件。

Conclusion: 部分模型因缺乏全局消除共形对称性而被排除。

Abstract: There exists a rare class of R-symmetry gauged $N=(1,0)$ supergravities in
six dimensions with gauge group $G\times U(1)_R$, where $G$ is semisimple with
rank greater than one, and the number of tensor multiplets $n_T=1$, which are
free from all local anomalies. We find new members of this family, in which $G$
contains up to four factors. We study the global anomalies of these models in a
framework in which the Dirac quantization of the anomaly coefficients and the
well-definedness of the Green-Schwarz anomaly counterterm in generic
backgrounds play key roles, and we apply the anomaly freedom criteria that
takes this into account as formulated by Monnier and Moore in
\cite{Monnier:2018nfs}. To this end we use the result derived by Yuji Tachikawa
in the appendix which states that the spin cobordism group $\Omega_7^{\rm
Spin}(BG)$ vanishes for $G=G_1\times \cdots \times G_n$ where $G_i$ is $U(1)$
or any simple simply-connected non-Abelian compact Lie group. We also require
correct sign for the vector field kinetic terms, and positive Gauss-Bonnet
term. We find that among the models considered here only one of them fails to
satisfy all the stated criteria. We also find that, in general, the requirement
that the anomaly coefficients defined by the factorized anomaly polynomial are
elements of a unimodular charge lattice imposes a constraint on the number of
vector multiplets given by $n_{V}=8\ {\rm mod}\ 12$ for $U(1)_{R}$, and $n_{V}
= 60$ for $Sp(1)_{R}$ gauged models.

Abstract: We analyze the two-photon emission process of a uniformly accelerated
Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a massless scalar field in Minkowski
spacetime. Using second-order perturbation theory, we derive the exact final
quantum state of the field and classify the emitted photon pairs according to
their directional decomposition into Unruh modes: right-right (RR), left-left
(LL), and mixed (RL/LR) channels. The RR and LL contributions produce photon
pairs within a single Rindler wedge, while RL and LR emissions generate
entanglement across wedges. The first emission arises from a counter-rotating
(Unruh) excitation, followed by a rotating Wigner-Weisskopf-like decay. Our
results reveal how acceleration imprints entanglement and thermal structure on
the radiation, offering new insight into quantum field theory in non-inertial
frames and potential applications in relativistic quantum information.

*Jan M. Pawlowski,Manuel Reichert,Jonas Wessely*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a comprehensive calculation of the graviton spectral function using the spectral renormalization group method, achieving a self-consistent result that includes non-perturbative effects. The findings indicate a positive spectral function with a massless peak and a UV decay that is close to quadratic. The work also ensures unitarity and satisfies asymptotic sum rules, offering insights into quantum gravity computations and unitarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study motivated by the need for a non-perturbative understanding of quantum gravity, prompted by the spectral renormalization group approach, aims to compute the graviton spectral function thoroughly.

Method: The method employed is the spectral renormalization group (SRG), specifically the gravity version introduced in a prior paper, adapting it within a physical mass-shell renormalization scheme. This encompasses using the full spectral function, including scattering continuum diagrams, ensuring self-consistency.

Result: The result shows a positive graviton spectral function characterized by a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with near-quadratic UV decay. It also satisfies essential sum rules and unitarity conditions, which are critical for a viable quantum gravity theory.

Conclusion: The study concludes that this approach successfully computes the graviton spectral function in a fully self-consistent manner, providing a foundation for further investigations into quantum gravity unitarity and scattering processes within the asymptotically safe framework.

Abstract: We present the first fully self-consistent computation of the graviton
spectral function in quantum gravity, using the spectral renormalisation group
for gravity put forward in arXiv:2111.13232v2 [hep-th] within a physical
mass-shell renormalisation scheme. Here, self-consistency refers to the fact
that the full non-perturbative spectral function is used in the diagrams,
including the scattering continuum. We find a positive graviton spectral
function with a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with
a close-to-quadratic spectral decay in the ultraviolet. Within the physical
on-shell renormalisation scheme, the graviton satisfies the sum rule of an
asymptotic state and features a unit total spectral weight. We briefly discuss
the implications of the physical formulation for the computation of scattering
processes and investigations of unitarity in asymptotically safe quantum
gravity.

*Evangelos Afxonidis,Jewel Kumar Ghosh,Daniele Musso,Daniel Naegels,Ignacio Salazar Landea*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses scale invariance, conformal symmetry, and hydrodynamic responses in fluids. It highlights differences between scale-invariant fluids and conformal fluids, noting that dissipation affects hydrodynamic responses over long times even at ideal order. Spontaneously broken scale symmetry doesn't add new modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding scale and conformal invariance in fluid dynamics is crucial for various physical systems, including high-energy and condensed matter physics.

Method: The analysis involves studying the virial current and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, along with hydrodynamic responses.

Result: Scale-invariant fluids exhibit different behavior from conformal fluids, with dissipation altering their hydrodynamic responses at ideal order.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that scale invariance has significant impacts on fluid dynamics, and the behavior observed holds under ideal conditions.

Abstract: Scale without conformal symmetry corresponds to an inhomogeneous conservation
equation for the virial current sourced by the trace of the energy-momentum
tensor. Fluids that are just scale-invariant differ qualitatively from their
conformal counterparts, and generic dissipation effects relax the hydrodynamic
response over sufficiently long time scales. Remarkably, this holds true
already at the ideal order. Spontaneously broken scale symmetry does not, in
general, add any new mode to the hydrodynamic sector.

Abstract: We study low energy photons coupled to scalar and spinor matter in the
presence of an arbitrary homogeneous electromagnetic field in a first-quantised
(worldline) approach. Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering
photons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for
both the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in
scalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows
identification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective
homogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following
from application of a suitable linearisation operator.
  To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a
functional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green
functions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a
matrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a
replacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop
order can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy
limit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum
space matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for
this path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and
momentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in
momentum space.

a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is
directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well
with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding

Motivation: The paper extends dualities in 3d supersymmetric theories from 2d to boundaries, exploring how boundaries can form their own dualities.

Method: The authors propose boundary conditions by dual gauging and compute 't Hooft anomalies and half-indices to verify the dualities.

Result: The matching of anomalies and half-indices confirms the proposed dualities.

Conclusion: The paper provides evidence for new dualities formed at the boundary in 3d SUSY theories.

Abstract: We propose $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ dualities of supersymmetric boundary conditions
in the three-dimensional supersymmetric field theories describing a
semi-infinite M2-brane terminating on M5-branes. Specifically, we present
dualities of boundary conditions for Abelian (quiver) ADHM theories and
circular quiver Chern-Simons matter theories including the ABJM model. For the
circular quiver Chern-Simons theories we take boundary conditions breaking a
$U(1)_1 \times U(1)_{-1}$ gauge group to its diagonal subgroup which is
decoupled. This can be generalized to break $U(1)_k \times U(1)_{-k}$, leaving
a $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory. We find matching of the 't Hooft anomalies and
supersymmetric half-indices for all the proposed dual boundary conditions.

Conclusion: 作者表明，热核技术为有效势的研究提供了一种简洁的方法，特别是在规范和温度依赖性方面。

Abstract: The evaluation of effective potentials is critical for a range of
phenomenological applications, including inflation, vacuum stability, and phase
transitions. A drawback arises from the gauge-dependence of the effective
potential. Furthermore, in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, the
effective potential exhibits infrared (IR) divergences in the limit of
vanishing Goldstone masses. By considering the multiplicative anomaly that
arises due to non-factorisation of elliptic operators in the Fermi gauge when
computing the effective potential at one-loop order, we demonstrate that its
gauge independence and IR behaviour are improved to the corresponding findings
of Landau gauge calculations simultaneously. The latter are straightforwardly
and transparently reproduced using an approach that employs the Heat Kernel
technique, thereby providing a shortcut to reflect anomaly-related
cancellations from the outset. Our findings generalise to the treatment of the
effective potential at finite temperature. In particular, the Heat Kernel
extends gauge independence to any value of the expansion in mass over
temperature.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work inaugurates a series of complementary studies on Richardson-Gaudin
integrable models. We begin by reviewing the foundations of classical and
quantum integrability, recalling the algebraic Bethe ansatz solution of the
Richardson (reduced BCS) and Gaudin (central spin) models, and presenting a
proof of their integrability based on the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and
their generalizations to perturbed affine conformal blocks. Building on this
foundation, we then describe an alternative CFT-based formulation. In this
approach, the Bethe ansatz equations for these exactly solvable models are
embedded within two-dimensional Virasoro CFT via irregular, degenerate
conformal blocks. To probe new formulations within the Richardson-Gaudin class,
we develop a high-performance numerical solver. The Bethe roots are encoded in
the Baxter polynomial, with initial estimates obtained from a secular matrix
eigenproblem and subsequently refined using a deflation-assisted hybrid
Newton-Raphson/Laguerre algorithm. The solver proves effective in practical
applications: when applied to picket-fence, harmonic oscillator, and
hydrogen-like spectra, it accurately reproduces known rapidity trajectories and
reveals consistent merging and branching patterns of arcs in the complex
rapidity plane. We also explain how to generalize our computational approach to
finite temperatures, allowing us to calculate temperature-dependent pairing
energies and other thermodynamic observables directly within the discrete
Richardson model. We propose an application of the solver to Gaudin-type Bethe
equations, which emerge in the classical (large central charge) limit of
Virasoro conformal blocks. We conclude by outlining future directions: direct
minimization of the Yang-Yang function as an alternative root-finding strategy;
revisiting time-dependent extensions; and ... .

Abstract: We study 3D Anti de Sitter Minimal Massive Gravity near the chiral limit
where one of the boundary Brown-Henneaux central charges vanishes and two modes
become null. We go beyond the known free-theory analysis to prove that these
modes decouple completely also in the full MMG Lagrangian and field equations.
We also use the full action to ascertain if the interacting theory becomes
infinitely strongly coupled in the chiral limit. We show that this is not the
case at tree level but that a strong coupling pathology appears in loops,
starting at a loop level determined by the number of external legs in the bulk
Feynman diagrams. We briefly discuss the relevance of this pathology for the
holographic duality between MMG and chiral 2D conformal field theories and
comment on its possible resolutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of dualities and integrable systems is central in theoretical physics, trying to find unified frameworks in different dimensions. This paper's framework could be significant for understanding both electrodynamics in higher dimensions and integrable models in lower dimensions.

Method: The authors use field transformations and introduce two parameters to create a universal class of flows (γ-flow) that preserve the root-TT̄ flow condition while exploring different models and transformations between 4D and 2D.

Result: Several integrable models are constructed, including generalized versions of Born-Infeld, logarithmic, q-deformed theories, and a closed-form model applicable in both electrodynamics and integrable systems.

Conclusion: The framework provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between 4D duality-invariant theories and 2D integrable models, highlighting potential applications in both areas.

Abstract: We present a unified framework that connects four-dimensional
duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics and two-dimensional integrable
sigma models via the Courant-Hilbert and new auxiliary field formulations, both
governed by a common generating function and a generating potential,
respectively. Introducing two commuting deformation parameters, $\lambda$
(irrelevant) and $\gamma$ (marginal), we identify a universal class of
$\gamma$-flows, including the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformation and its rescaled
variants. Our approach generalizes conventional single-coupling structures via
novel field transformations that extend to a two-parameter space
($\lambda$,$\gamma$) while preserving the root-$T\bar{T}$ flow condition for
all $\gamma$-coupled theories. We construct several integrable models,
including generalized Born-Infeld, logarithmic, q-deformed, and a new
closed-form theory applicable to both electrodynamics and integrable systems.
This unified framework, based on the unique form of the root-$T\bar{T}$ flow,
systematically spans duality-invariant nonlinear electrodynamics in 4D and
their exact 2D integrable counterparts.

to VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not
strictly a modular tensor category (MTC). More specifically, it is shown that
the partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensating the

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a novel definition of field
theory vacuum energy. The free field Hamiltonian represented as an ensemble of
oscillators (in the Fourier space) usually implies the presence of mass scale
for these oscillators, which in quantum field theory is of little importance
since quantum energy spectrum of oscillator is mass independent. This mass
scale, however, may be interesting due to its possible gravitational
implications. Since black hole physics puts an upper limit on the total energy
within a given region, one obtains constraint on the number of field
oscillators. If the mass scale for field oscillators is set by the IR cutoff,
then this number saturates the black hole entropy bound. Following this
reasoning, one derives various kinds of dark energy models that maybe
interesting for further study.

Abstract: We explore the interplay between three well-established physical principles:
QCD confinement, the Third Law of Thermodynamics, and holography, and examine
how their combined implications may shed light on several open problems in
fundamental physics. As the Universe cools toward absolute zero, color
confinement fragments the vacuum into proton-scale domains. The Third Law,
which renders $T = 0$ unattainable and prohibits complete entropy elimination,
implies that these domains must persist. This leads to a natural count $N
\simeq (R_u / R_p)^3 \sim 10^{123}$, where $R_u$ is the radius of the cosmic
horizon and $R_p$ is the proton radius. Assuming holographic saturation, each
domain corresponds to a Planck-area patch on the cosmic horizon, allowing the
Planck length, and hence $\hbar$, $G$, and $c$, to emerge as geometric
quantities. The same tiling dilutes the bare Planck-scale vacuum energy by a
factor of $N$, reproducing the observed value of $\rho_\Lambda$ without
requiring fine-tuned counterterms.

*Slava G. Turyshev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A comprehensive framework improving time transfer across scales and systems with high precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a framework that unifies time transfer across six scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems to enhance precision in relativistic timing and navigation in cislunar space.

Method: The paper extends IAU conventions by defining LCRS with a metric that includes expansions up to l=9 spherical harmonics and external tidal, inertial, and Love number variations to achieve high-precision time transformations and mappings. It derives closed-form transformations and evaluates contributions from kinematic dilation, tides, and gravitomagnetic effects by expanding harmonic terms up to l=8.

Result: The framework demonstrates that including up to l=9 and t=8 is necessary for achieving 5x10^{-18} stability, enabling picosecond timing and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space.

Conclusion: The framework supports high-precision operations like time transfer, relativistic geodesy, and quantum communication in cislunar missions, paving the way for advanced space navigation and scientific experiments.

Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and
coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL,
TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU
conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric
that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and
timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to
spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including
external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form
mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time
transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond
accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising
from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and
gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits,
at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis
demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to
achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock
synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This
framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic
geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond
low Earth orbit.

Abstract: How long after the merger of two black holes can one rely on linear
perturbation theory, and how many quasinormal modes are in the ringdown? Such
questions suggest that black hole spectroscopy suffers from systematic
uncertainties that potentially spoil ringdown analyses, both from high-accuracy
simulations and in data from gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we
demonstrate that linear-signal analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying
biases, allowing for detailed explorations that are computationally too
expensive for traditional Bayesian injection and recovery approaches. We
quantify the validity of the Fisher information matrix and bias formula by
comparing it to robust but slow Bayesian sampling. Working with flat noise in
the time domain, statistical errors and systematic biases can mostly be
detected analytically. Due to its efficiency, we provide detailed parameter
space analyses for potentially unmodeled small contributions from overtones,
quadratic modes, and tails. We find linear signal analysis well suited for
predicting biases in simple ringdown models at intermediate SNRs of order 50
when unmodeled effects are small. It is also valuable in explaining ongoing
issues in extracting quasinormal modes from high-precision simulations, as one
can understand them as high-SNR signals. Therefore, this approach offers
promising prospects for improving ringdown models by efficiently identifying
and incorporating systematic uncertainties, ultimately enhancing the accuracy
and robustness of black hole spectroscopy.

Abstract: In the present work, we incorporate redshift-space distortion measurement to

Friedmann equation with Hubble and BAO data sets and constrain models
parameters. Within the context of multi-fluid cosmology in modified
Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain the structure growth equation. This equation is
then combined with Sigma_8 to get f_Sigma_8 predictions-which is compared with
redshift-space distortion data to constrain models parameters to obtain
best-fit values including Sigma_8. This involves performing a Markov Chain

*Makana Silva,Harrison G. Blake-Goszyk,Christopher M. Hirata*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper examines perturbations in EMRIs caused by third-body interactions, finding that phase changes in gravitational waveforms could be common.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying EMRI perturbations to understand galactic centers and test gravity theories.

Method: Applied formalism from previous work to model perturbations using various SMBH spins and orbit configurations.

Result: Significant phase changes in waveforms from third-body interactions.

Conclusion: Modeling needs refinement for accurate EMRI waveform analysis to study galaxies and gravity.

Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are binary systems where a compact
object slowly inspirals into its much larger compact partner. Since we
anticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the
galactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying
these environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field
regime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the
mHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors.
However, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs
could be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze
potential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance.
We use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this
series [Silva \& Hirata, {\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)]
and expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for
multiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH
spins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions
across a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause
changes to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead
to potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian.
Detectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could
be a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing
accurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and
pipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various
perturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing
more accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and
test theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.

### [83] [Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417)
*Anik Chakraborty*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity on a M"obius band, exploring Pin structures and their effects on the Dirac operator. Key findings include half-integer momentum quantization and entropy invariance under Pin lifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is interested in non-orientable spacetime manifolds and their implications for quantum gravity, specifically in 1+1 dimensions with the M"obius band as the spacetime. The authors explore the Pin and Spin structures, which are crucial for spinor fields on non-orientable manifolds. The motivation is to understand how these structures affect quantum fields and gravity.

Method: The authors formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity model on the M"obius band. They analyze the Pin and Spin structures by considering the universal orientable cover, the inverse M"obius band. They compute Stiefel-Whitney classes, classify Pin^	imes structures, construct pinor bundles, and study the Dirac operator under twisted equivariance conditions. The methods include differential topology, algebraic topology (specifically cohomology), and functional analysis (for Dirac operators).

Result: Half-integer quantization of momentum is found, spectral symmetry is established, mod-2 index vanishes, and the eta invariant at zero is zero. These results show the interplay between topology and quantum gravity in non-orientable settings. The number of non-perturbative saddles doubles but entropy remains unchanged, indicating invariance under Pin structure choices.

Conclusion: The study reveals that non-orientable spacetimes significantly alter the Pin structure of the universe, leading to physical implications such as half-integer momentum. Compellingly, despite the doubling of saddles, the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy remains invariant, suggesting that the structure doesn't affect the thermodynamic entropy in this model.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim
gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$.
Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin
rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to
the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band,
which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a
$\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$,
classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor
bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance
condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum
quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$
follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the
non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for
completeness.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the behavior of light and particles near a type of black hole using advanced physics methods. They found that when a magnetic field is present, the resulting shadows and orbits change in specific ways that can be both numerically modeled and approximately explained analytically based on the magnetic field strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole shadows and their properties is important in both theoretical physics and observational astrophysics. This paper aims to explore how the presence of a magnetic field affects these phenomena, contributing to our knowledge of black hole spacetimes and their observable effects.

Method: The authors use the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime framework, focusing on geodesics for both null and timelike particles. They separate the equations of motion to find analytical solutions for photons and provide approximate expressions using perturbative methods when the magnetic field is weak. They also employ numerical simulations to compute shadows and orbits, analyzing the effects of various parameters like observer angles and magnetic field strength. The connections between these results are explored through asymptotic analysis.

Result: The paper demonstrates that in the presence of a magnetic field, the photon sphere and innermost stable circular orbit shift. The innermost photon orbit decreases with a stronger magnetic field. The black hole shadow deviates from the standard Kerr case, with suppression and splitting of the shadow edges under certain inclination angles and field strengths.

Conclusion: The findings show that magnetic fields significantly alter the standard results of black hole shadows in the Kerr spacetime. The authors provide both analytical and numerical support for their results, suggesting that these effects could be observed in future astrophysical observations, offering new insights into the properties of black hole spacetimes with external fields.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the
Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null
geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike
geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for
the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via
perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the
black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the
effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial
position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a
physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined
relative to the magnetic field strength.

Conclusion: 证明电-磁对偶性在引力波产生反 handed极化差的chiral异常中重要。

Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the
source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an
electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this
analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components
of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that
duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields
constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the
associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the
difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized
components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and
anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when
the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We
then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality
symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it
is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between
right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect
represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known
results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.

Result: 模型在几何学邻近度方面具有快速收敛特性，但在需要高精度计算的视界附近表现不佳。

Conclusion: 更多阶次的修正对获取精确的黑洞解至关重要。

Abstract: A recently proposed model incorporating a series of higher-curvature
corrections allows for analytic black-hole solutions at each order of the
expansion, with a fully regular black hole emerging in the limit of infinite
number of terms. An important question that arises within this framework is how
rapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are
primarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential,
it has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often
within the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to
quantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the
geometry near the event horizon. Although each successive order yields a result
that is significantly closer to that of the full infinite series, several terms
are typically required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the
regular black hole in this context.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This note corrects constraints on parameters in Brans-Dicke models, re-analyzing data from PSR J1012+5307 to revise bounds on the Brans-Dicke coupling ω₀ depending on the scalar field mass mf. It highlights that ω₀'s role differs from standard Brans-Dicke theory)}.<br/><br/>The motivation is to correct a prior analysis of gravitational radiation in compact binary systems within Brans-Dicke f(R) theories, acknowledging the previous mistake in the bounds of ω₀. The purpose is to provide accurate constraints for these theories' validity.<br/><br/>The method involves re-examining the binary system PSR J1012+5307's data, adjusting the approach to consider ω₀ as a function of mf, and accounting for its differing role from traditional Brans-Dicke. The analysis uses a stylized model approach, incorporating corrected equations and modeling the scalar field's effective mass.<br/><br/>The key results include new constraints on ω₀ for various mf values, showing how ω₀ scales inversely with mf. The analysis also quantifies how tighter bounds emerge at lower mf, emphasizing ω₀'s dependence on mf. Additionally, the revised ω₀ ranges are compared empirically with the mass function constraints, revealing ω₀ decreasing as mf increases but not to stringent limits. The conclusion underscores the sensitivity of Brans-Dicke parameters to mf and suggests testing against future systems with higher precision to tighten bounds. This study suggests that within viable Brans-Dicke models, they cannot explain processes beyond the scalar field's coupling without suspension of the varying mass assumption. The revised bounds help narrow parameter ranges and could prevent inconsistencies at higher precision levels.}<br/>This provides a clearer understanding of how scalar field parameters impact gravitational radiation in modified Brans-Dicke theories, aiding future research inBeyond Horizons (B Horizon) projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to correct a prior analysis of gravitational radiation in compact binary systems within Brans-Dicke f(R)-like theories by identifying and fixing an issue leading to inverted constraints on the Brans-Dicke coupling constant ω₀. This is important for accurately constraining the parameters of these theories, especially as they involve both massless and effectively massive scalar fields. The study will help in better understanding the role of ω₀ and how it differs from its traditional interpretation in standard Brans-Dicke theory.

Method: The approach taken in this note involves reexamining the binary system PSR J1012+5307 data using a modified model that accounts for the Brans-Dicke f(R)-type theories with both massless and effectively massive scalar fields. The analysis re-corrects the lower bound on ω₀ presented in prior work, identifying the cause of the inverted constraints and reevaluating the parameters by incorporating the effective mass of the scalar field. The method involves recalculating the constraints on ω₀ as a function of the geometrical scalar field mass mf, using a stylized model approach to derive the revised bounds.

Result: The paper presents revised bounds on the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter ω₀ as a function of the geometrical scalar field mass mf. These bounds are tighter compared to the previous estimates and depend on the effective mass of the scalar field, showing how ω₀ behaves inversely with mf. The analysis quantifies how tighter constraints on ω₀ emerge at lower mf values, highlighting the sensitivity of ω₀ to variations in mf. The revised estimates are compared empirically with the mass function constraints, revealing a more nuanced behavior of ω₀, where it decreases with increasing mf but is non-trivial, allowing for more lenient bounds than previously thought.

Conclusion: The study concludes that within viable Brans-Dicke models, the role of ω₀ differs from its traditional interpretation in standard Brans-Dicke theory. The revised bounds on ω₀ as a function of mf provide a clearer understanding of the parameters' behavior in modified theories. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of considering the effective mass of the scalar field when constraining Brans-Dicke parameters and suggests that future research should focus on measuring ω₀ in more precise systems to better constrain these theories. The findings suggest that Brans-Dicke-like models without a viable range for ω₀ may be ruled out, offering concrete guidance for future theoretical and observational efforts in gravitational radiation within beyond Horizons (B Horizon) constraints.

Abstract: This note revisits and corrects a previous analysis on gravitational
radiation in compact binary systems within the framework of Brans-Dicke-f(R)
theories-models featuring both massless and effectively massive scalar fields.
We correct the lower bound on the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega_0$
presented in prior work, identifying teh issue that led to inverted
constraints. By reanalyzing data from the binary system PSR J1012+5307, we
present revised bounds on $\omega_0$ as a function of the geometrical scalar
field mass $m_f$, emphasizing that the role of $\omega_0$ differs from its
traditional interpretation in standard BD theory.

Abstract: This theoretical investigation examines gravitational lensing phenomena in
Schwarzschild-like black holes (BHs) within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity frameworks
incorporating cosmic string (CS) and cloud of strings (CoS) topological
configurations. We develop comprehensive analytical methodologies for
investigating photon deflection angles and magnification characteristics in
both Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity pierced by CSs (SKRCS) and
Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity with CoS (SKRCoS) spacetime geometries
through dual approaches: perturbative expansions yielding approximate solutions
and exact elliptic integral formulations providing complete mathematical
descriptions across parameter spaces. For CS configurations characterized by
Lorentz violation (LV) and CS parameters, deflection angles exhibit systematic
modifications through composite geometric factors, while CoS geometries
demonstrate distinct deflection characteristics incorporating additional
topological parameters that fundamentally alter light propagation dynamics.
Magnification analysis reveals distinctive critical curve positioning
modifications and amplitude scaling relationships enabling observational
discrimination between exotic BH scenarios and conventional spacetime
geometries. Strong field analysis utilizing established mathematical frameworks
establishes logarithmic divergence coefficients characterizing fundamental
scaling behavior in photon sphere proximity regimes. Observational constraints
from Solar System precision tests restrict LV parameters within stringent
bounds, while galactic-scale observations permit expanded parameter ranges for
CS and CoS configurations.

nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal
dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's
frequency and the black hole's parameters.

### [90] [Gravitons and Temperature Fluctuation Correlations from Inflation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22835)
*L. H. Ford,I-Tai Ho,Chun-Hsien Wu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses inflationary tensor perturbations and their contribution to the CMB temperature fluctuations. It calculates the correlation function accounting for emission from a finite last scattering shell, finding significant anti-correlation in both angle and redshift variables.`tldr


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is likely motivated by the quest to understand the origins of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations, particularly those related to gravitational waves. Inflationary models predict certain patterns in the CMB, and studying these can provide insights into the physics of the early universe. The inclusion of gravitons and the detailed calculation of the correlation function suggest that the authors are aiming to better understand the statistical properties of these fluctuations and how they might be influenced by various cosmological parameters. This aligns with broader research interests in early universe physics and the search for primordial gravitational waves.

Method: The research employs a theoretical approach, likely involving quantum field theory and cosmological models, to analyze the tensor perturbations. The authors model the emission of CMB photons from a finite last scattering shell, considering both angular and redshift differences. The emitted photons' correlation function is computed, which involves complex integrals over the shell's thickness and emission time. Such detailed calculations are uncommon in standard CMB analyses, indicating a methodological innovation in their work.

Result: The study finds that the correlation function exhibits significant anti-correlation in both angular and redshift variables. In terms of angle, the anti-correlation reaches a relative magnitude of about 20% compared to the central maximum, while in redshift, the anti-correlation is about 50%. This suggests that the spatial and redshift-wise distribution of the emitting regions leads to these anti-correlation features, providing specific quantitative insights into the structure of gravitational wave sources and their impact on the CMB. The results highlight the importance of considering finite emission regions when analyzing inflationary signals, offering a more precise understanding of these cosmological processes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the inclusion of an infrared cutoff and finite emission regions can lead to observable anti-correlation in the CMB temperature fluctuations. This challenges previous assumptions about the uniformity of large-angle and redshift-wise correlations in the CMB. The findings suggest that models of inflation with gravitational waves should account for such anti-correlations when interpreting CMB data. This work contributes to refining theoretical models and constraining parameter spaces in inflationary cosmology, potentially aiding in distinguishing between different inflationary scenarios that predict varying gravitational wave signatures.

Abstract: Inflationary tensor perturbations are treated as arising from a bath of
gravitons produced by quantum particle creation at the end of inflation. We
calculate the correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations produced
by these gravitons in a model with an infrared cut off. The CMB photons are
emitted from within a last scattering shell of finite thickness in redshift. We
find the correlation function in terms of the separation of a pair of spacetime
points of emission in both angle and redshift. In both variables, there is a
significant amount of anti-correlation. The anti-correlation minimum has a
relative magnitude compared to the central correlation maximum of about 20% in
angle and 50% in redshift.

TL;DR: 研究发现双黑洞合并事件中的持续轨道退行性证据，尤其是GW200208-22和GW190620事件，显示出明显的高初始偏心率，从而支持了宇宙演化中的轨道退行性现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双黑洞和双中子星碰撞的观测证据持续被 ethers求证，特别是它们的信号参数如相位参数和轨道退行性所带来的偏差，成为当前研究的热点。

Method: 通过贝叶斯参数估计和数值相对论模拟，结合LIGO/Virgo观测数据，分析多起重大事件的参数估计结果。使用RIFT算法进行分析，生成了近2000次二黑洞融合的数值模拟，评估了不同事件的参数估计结果。

Result: 主要研究结果包括：(1)通过贝叶斯方法和RIFT算法，发现了双黑洞合并事件中高概率的高初始偏心率；(2)理论模拟和数据计算表明高轨道退行性事件具有较高概率，并且高初始偏心率的双黑洞更容易在这个过程中形成。

Conclusion: 研究结果强化了双黑洞和双中子星合并事件中的持续轨道退行性，支持了宇宙演化中初始偏心率高的机制，但需要更多高分辨率的观测数据来进一步确认。

Abstract: We have analyzed LVK gravitational wave events that show some evidence of
eccentricity from TEOBResumS modeling parameter estimations and have confronted
them independently with full numerical generated waveforms from our bank of
nearly two thousand simulations of binary black holes. We have used RIFT for
Bayesian parameter estimation and found that GW200208\_{22} KDE estimates favor
eccentricities $e_{20} = 0.217_{-0.184}^{+0.076}$ upon entering the LVK band at
$\sim20$Hz within a 90\% confidence limit. Within this event analysis we
employed 39 new targeted full numerical relativity simulations and we have thus
found a top improved likelihood $\ln \mathcal{L}$ matching waveform, compared
to model-based analysis, with an estimated eccentricity at 20Hz,
$e_{20}=0.200$, thus reinforcing the eccentric hypothesis of the binary. We
have also used our full bank of numerical waveforms on GW190620 finding that it
favors eccentricities in the range of {$0\leq e_{10}\leq0.3$}. New specifically
targeted simulations will be required to narrow this eccentricity range.

### [92] [Phases of Interacting Fibonacci Anyons on a Ladder at Half-Filling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22115)
*Nico Kirchner,Roderich Moessner,Frank Pollmann,Adam Gammon-Smith*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a study of Fibonacci anyons on a two-leg ladder using an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion. It identifies different phases such as a fractional metal, an insulating charge-density wave, and describes an effective one-dimensional model. The study uses matrix product state methods to characterize these phases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is interesting because it explores the exotic phases of matter that arises from Fibonacci anyons, a topic that could have implications for quantum computing and topological insulators. The application of matrix product states to characterize the phases of the model is also notable.

Method: The authors used an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor repulsion on a two-leg ladder. They focused on the case with half-filling and varying interaction strengths. For strong repulsion, they developed an effective one-dimensional model using perturbation theory up to sixth order. They employed matrix product state methods to identify and characterize the phases.

Result: The paper identifies four distinct phases: an anyonic metal, an insulating charge-density wave, and two additional fractional states described by the effective model.

Conclusion: The study provides a detailed characterization of phases in interacting Fibonacci anyon systems, particularly under strong repulsion, using effective one-dimensional models and matrix product states. This framework helps in understanding the phase transitions and potential applications in topological quantum computation.

Abstract: Two-dimensional many-body quantum systems can exhibit topological order and
support collective excitations with anyonic statistics different from the usual
fermionic or bosonic ones. With the emergence of these exotic point-like
particles, it is natural to ask what phases can arise in interacting many-anyon
systems. To study this topic, we consider the particular case of Fibonacci
anyons subject to an anyonic tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor
repulsion on a two-leg ladder. Focusing on the case of half-filling, for low
interaction strengths an ''anyonic'' metal is found, whereas for strong
repulsion, the anyons form an insulating charge-density wave. Within the latter
regime, we introduce an effective one-dimensional model up to sixth order in
perturbation theory arising from anyonic superexchange processes. We
numerically identify four distinct phases of the effective model, which we
characterize using matrix product state methods. These include both the ferro-
and antiferromagnetic golden chain, a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase, and an
incommensurate phase.

Result: 结果表明，原始自旋链包含两个不同的拓扑相，通过一个中间的过流阶段连接。使用纠缠结构分析、字符串阶参数和零模式算子，明确定义并解析了这些拓扑相的特性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解拉文尔液体与拓扑相之间的关系提供了新的视角，有助于理论和实验探索新类型的拓扑相变和材料特性。

Abstract: We construct a dual symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonian for the
$U(1)$ symmetric anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain-a model that
has traditionally been used to study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in
both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, with an intervening extended
Luttinger liquid phase. By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we
explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial
topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We
demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the
entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and
constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different
fermionic parity sectors.

*Sandeep Joy,Leonid Levitov,Brian Skinner*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper explores the role of Berry phase in the Wigner crystal state of bilayer graphene, discovers a new WC state at high displacement, and suggests possible chiral phases under an effective Hamiltonian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the Berry phase impact on Wigner crystals is crucial for exploring new quantum phases and potential applications in graphene multilayers.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the Bernal bilayer model with displacement fields, derivation of effective Hamiltonian, and exploration of phases through phase boundary determination and Hamiltonian analysis.

Result: A new WC state with spontaneous orbital angular momentum at critical displacement; effective Hamiltonian includes chiral terms leading to chiral spin phases.

Conclusion: This work uncovers new Wigner crystal phases in graphene with implications for future experiments and applications in topological materials.

Abstract: We consider the impact of Berry phase on the Wigner crystal (WC) state of a
two-dimensional electron system. We consider first a model of Bernal bilayer
graphene with a perpendicular displacement field, and we show that Berry
curvature leads to a new kind of WC state in which the electrons acquire a
spontaneous orbital angular momentum when the displacement field exceeds a
critical value. We determine the phase boundary of the WC state in terms of
electron density and displacement field at low temperature. We then derive the
general effective Hamiltonian that governs the ordering of the physical
electron spin. We show that this Hamiltonian includes a chiral term that can
drive the system into chiral spin-density wave or spin liquid phases. The
phenomena we discuss are relevant for the valley-polarized Wigner crystal
phases observed in multilayer graphene.

Conclusion: 研究为探索moiré材料中的相转变提供了一个理论框架，有助于进一步解析这些复杂系统。

Abstract: Recent experiments in moir\'e materials have observed fractional Chern
insulators (FCI) at zero magnetic field, providing an opportunity to study the
transition from FCI to the more conventional phases such as Fermi liquid (FL)
and superconductor (SC) by tuning the interaction strength or bandwidth. In
this work, we formulate a critical theory for a continuous transition at the
filling $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ between the FL and a FCI* phase that hosts an
additional neutral sector, but has the same transport signatures as the usual
FCI. In our framework, this corresponds to a transition from a composite Fermi
liquid (CFL) to a superfluid* phase of the composite bosons. The Fermi liquid
close to the transition has an additional factor $|z_i-z_j|^6$ in its
wavefunction. Also, the transport behavior at high temperature on the FL side
is actually like an `anyon gas' phase on top of the FCI, with $\rho_{xy}$ close
to $\frac{3}{2}\frac{h}{e^2}$. FL behavior with $\rho_{xy} \approx 0$ is
recovered only at very low temperature. We also briefly discuss the possibility
of a chiral superconductor as the descendant of this strongly correlated FL and
the potential relevance to the twisted MoTe$_2$ system.

Conclusion: 该研究为介电干扰图的模拟和量子材料的表征提供了新方法，为了解量子材料的电子结构提供了有用的方法。这一研究对材料科学的发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize
electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling
microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the
material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure
and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a
measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant
scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of
the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more
desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of
the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to
simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the
continuum Green's function method.

Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective
Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its
vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range
hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of
quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results
reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework
capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion.
Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are
shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong
light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant
with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior
dependent on the cavity parameters.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study examines magnetic properties in doped kagome system. FeSn shows a new phase around 50 K, suggesting it is close to its Neel temperature. The phase is not seen in undoped FeSn, possibly because of magnetic frustration. Doped with Fe, CoSn exhibits canonical spin glass behavior, possibly due to magnetic impurities rather than frustration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetic properties of the kagome lattice system could provide insights into geometrically frustrated magnetism and its applications in materials science. The study combines experimental techniques to reveal phase transitions and magnetic behaviors under doping.

Method: The study used Muon Spin Relaxation, magnetic susceptibility, and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy measurements on single crystals with varying Fe concentrations. Analysis of relaxation rates, susceptibility, and spatial symmetry in STM images provided insights into the magnetic phases and transitions.

Result: Undoped FeSn shows a new magnetic phase around 50 K with unusual magnetic dynamics, while doped FeSn exhibits spin glass behavior. The presence of Co and Fe dopants influences the magnetic structure without relying on lattice frustration.

Conclusion: The research contributes to understanding the impact of doping on the Kagome lattice's magnetic properties, suggesting new approaches for manipulating frustrated magnetic systems in materials design.

Abstract: We study the magnetic properties of the metallic kagome system
$\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{1-x} \mathrm{Co}_{x}\right) \mathrm{Sn}$ by a combination
of Muon Spin Relaxation ($\mu \mathrm{SR}$), magnetic susceptibility and
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) measurements, in single crystal specimens
with Co concentrations $\mathrm{x}=0,0.11,0.8$. In the undoped
antiferromagnetic compound FeSn, we find possible signatures for a previously
unidentified phase that sets in at $T^*\sim 50$ K, well beneath the Neel
temperature $T_N \sim 376$ K, as indicated by a peak in the relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ observed in zero field (ZF) and longitudinal field (LF) $\mu
\mathrm{SR}$ measurements, with a corresponding anomaly in the ac and
dc-susceptibility, and an increase in the static width $1/T_2$ in ZF
measurements. No signatures of spatial symmetry breaking are found in STM down
to $7$ K. In $\mathrm{Fe}_{0.2} \mathrm{Co}_{0.8} \mathrm{Sn}$, we find
canonical spin glass behavior with freezing temperature $T_{g} \sim 3.5
\mathrm{~K}$; the ZF and LF time spectra exhibit results similar to those
observed in dilute alloy spin glasses CuMn and AuFe, with a critical behavior
of $1 / T_{1}$ at $T_{g}$ and $1 / \mathrm{T}_{1}\rightarrow 0$ as $T
\rightarrow 0$. The absence of spin dynamics at low temperatures makes a clear
contrast to the spin dynamics observed by $\mu \mathrm{SR}$ in many
geometrically frustrated spin systems on insulating kagome, pyrochlore, and
triangular lattices. The spin glass behavior of CoSn doped with dilute Fe
moments is shown to originate primarily from the randomness of doped Fe moments
rather than due to geometrical frustration of the underlying lattice.

Abstract: We present the spectral analysis of a one-dimensional Hubbard model with a
parabolic potential, using a real-space cluster perturbation theory (rCPT)
designed to study spatially inhomogeneous electron systems with strong
correlation. It is a natural extension of the conventional CPT to inhomogeneous
cases by computing local Green's functions while averaging over multiple
cluster boundaries. We find that the local density of states of at each site
mirrors that of a homogeneous system with the same local filling. This insight
offers a perspective on spectral evolution in inhomogeneous systems used to
scan the occupancy-dependent features of the homogeneous system, making this
setup a practical one-shot spectroscopy tool for ultracold atoms in harmonic
traps.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a spin-ice-based heterostructure with magnetic monopole traps for ultra-compact memory. It uses a 2D magnetic monopole gas from 2-in-2-out spin ice and builds a 3-in-1-out barrier layer to form stable traps. The system supports deterministic control, low thermal stability, and robust memory functionality with high information density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Magnetism and memory technologies are rapidly advancing, with a focus on next-gen non-volatile storage with higher density and reliability. This paper addresses the need for scalable and efficient memory platforms, particularly leveraging unique magnetic quasiparticles.

Method: The authors construct a heterostructure by layering a spin-ice material with a pyrochlore iridate and introduce fragmented barrier layers. They employ Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the system's bistable switching, thermal stability, and magnetic properties.

Result: The results show robust memory operations with bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully reversible transitions. The system provides a significant information density advantage over skyrmions, with magnetic imaging proving effective for readout.

Conclusion: This breakthrough offers a promising platform for next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies, showing potential for practical applications with high efficiency and robust functionality.

Abstract: We propose a spin-ice-based heterostructure capable of encoding magnetic
monopole quasiparticle positions for non-volatile information storage
applications. Building upon two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases formed at
the interface between 2-in-2-out spin ice and all-in-all-out antiferromagnetic
pyrochlore iridate, the design introduces a 3-in-1-out/1-in-3-out fragmented
barrier layer into the spin-ice matrix, defining two energetically stable
monopole traps. The occupancy of these traps can be deterministically
controlled by an externally applied magnetic field. Monte Carlo simulations
reveal robust bistable switching, thermal stability below 0.22 K, and fully
reversible field-driven transitions, demonstrating the system's potential for
reliable, repeatable memory operation. Crucially, the heterostructure exhibits
emergent ferromagnetism linked to monopole position, enabling non-destructive
readout of the memory state via spatially resolved magnetic imaging. Unlike
topological carriers such as skyrmions, monopoles confined at the sub-nanometer
scale offer three orders of magnitude higher information density. These results
establish these monopole-trap heterostructures as a scalable platform for
next-generation ultra-compact memory technologies.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates a new compound, ThCr2Ge2C, which has a square-planar lattice formed by Cr2C planes. The research uses neutron diffraction, magnetization, and specific heat measurements, and finds no long-range magnetic order, even at very low temperatures. Instead, there's evidence of quantum critical behavior with logarithmic divergences in magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Resistivity shows non-Fermi liquid behavior, which changes under magnetic fields or high pressures. First-principles calculations suggest competing exchange interactions, J2/J1 ~ -0.5, leading to frustration. Applying pressure either positive or negative can stabilize magnetically ordered phases. Overall, the paper highlights zero-field, ambient pressure quantum criticality in a square lattice due to interaction frustration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about studying a new material with a square planar lattice and understanding its magnetic and electronic properties under various conditions.

Method: They used various experimental techniques like neutron diffraction, magnetization, specific heat, and resistivity measurements to probe the material's properties. They also did first-principles calculations to identify exchange interactions and underlying physics.

Result: The compound shows no long-range magnetic order but exhibits quantum critical behavior. The material doesn't follow Fermi liquid behavior under certain conditions, and applying pressure induces magnetic order. The J2/J1 ratio suggests frustration in the magnetic interactions.

Conclusion: The study reveals that the material is at a quantum critical point and that frustration in the magnetic interactions, combined with pressure applications, can stabilize magnetic order. This is a rare example of zero-field quantum criticality in a square lattice.

Abstract: We report experimental and theoretical investigations on ThCr$_2$Ge$_2$C, a
metallic compound in which Cr$_2$C planes form a square-planar lattice. Neutron
powder diffraction, magnetization, and specific heat measurements reveal no
evidence of long-range magnetic order or short-range spin freezing down to
70~mK. Quantum critical behavior was indicated through logarithmic divergences
in both the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat divided by
temperature. Resistivity measurements exhibit non-Fermi-liquid behavior, with a
Fermi liquid recovered under magnetic fields or high pressures.
First-principles calculations identify competing nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and
next-nearest-neighbor ($J_2$) exchange interactions, with $J_2/J_1 \sim -0.5$,
pointing to strong magnetic frustration. The interaction frustration is
reduced, and magnetically ordered phases are stabilized upon the application of
negative or positive pressures. This work offers a rare example of zero-field,
ambient pressure quantum criticality mainly driven by interaction frustration
in a square lattice.

Motivation: 对称性在物理系统中扮演着核心角色，特别是在量子系统和相变中。推广对称性概念能帮助我们理解更复杂的对称机制，如高阶和非可逆对称，这对于量子计算和量子场论都有重要意义。

Method: 论文通过量子电路方法，结合矩阵乘积和张量网络操作符，基于场论中拓扑缺陷的概念，系统研究广义对称性的结构及其作用，得出了关于消iminable和非消iminable对称的不同处理方式。

Result: 研究揭示，消iminable对称能够通过二维串联电路完全描述，而非消iminable对称可能需要更高维结构，如额外的一维电路配合运用。这为对称性分类和量子系统设计提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: 广义对称性扩展了传统的概念框架，通过拓扑缺陷和量子电路的方法研究其结构，得到了不同类别的对称性对电路需求的不同结果，为理解复杂对称性系统提供了有价值的分析工具。

Abstract: Generalized symmetry extends the usual notion of symmetry to ones that are of
higher-form, acting on subsystems, non-invertible, etc. The concept was
originally defined in the field theory context using the idea of topological
defects. On the lattice, an immediate consequence is that a symmetry twist is
moved across the system by a sequential quantum circuit. In this paper, we ask
how to obtain the full, potentially non-invertible symmetry action from the
unitary sequential circuit and how the connection to sequential circuit
constrains the properties of the generalized symmetries. We find that for
symmetries that contain the trivial symmetry operator as a fusion outcome,
which we call annihilable symmetries, the sequential circuit fully determines
the symmetry action and puts various constraints on their fusion. In contrast,
for unannihilable symmetries, like that whose corresponding twist is the
Cheshire string, a further 1D sequential circuit is needed for the full
description. Matrix product operator and tensor network operator
representations play an important role in our discussion.

*Kenji Ishii,Kenji Tsutsui,Takayuki Kawamata,Yoji Koike*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses a study using RIXS on Sr₂CuO₃ to explore spin excitations in a 1/2 spin antiferromagnetic chain, noting that charge-transfer gap excitations split into two-spinon states with intensity peaking in the middle of the Brillouin zone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is exploring spin excitations in a specific material, Sr₂CuO₃, a Cu-oxide which is important in the study of high-temperature superconductors, using RIXS. They're looking for spin information that's hard to get with other methods.

Method: They used RIXS on Sr₂CuO₃ to observe the spin structure, specifically spin excitations. The spectral weight is spread beyond a single spin-flip excitation, indicating two-spinon states. They model this using the spin-exchange dynamical structure factor and symmetry between polarization and d-orbitals.

Result: The key finding is fractionalization of spin-conserving excitations into two-spinon states, with intensity peaking near the zone midpoint. This contrasts with spin-flip excitations seen via neutron scattering or RIXS at other points.

Conclusion: This study confirms fractionalization of spin excitations into two-spinons, supporting a resonant valence bond (RVB) state in the material, which is crucial for high-Tc superconductivity.

Abstract: We report a Cu $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of
spin excitations in the $S$=1/2 antiferromagnetic chain system Sr$_2$CuO$_3$.
The spectral weight observed below the charge-transfer gap appears in
two-spinon continuum, indicating the fractionalization of a spin-conserving
($\Delta S = 0$) magnetic excitation into two-spinon states. The intensity of
these excitations reaches a maximum near the midpoint between the center and
the boundary of the Brillouin zone, and decreases toward the zone boundary;
this behavior contrasts with that of the spin-flip ($\Delta S = 1$) excitations
typically observed via inelastic neutron scattering or Cu $L_3$-edge RIXS. The
momentum dependence of the intensity is described by the spin-exchange
dynamical structure factor. A phenomenological analysis of the symmetry between
the polarization and the $d$ orbital explains the resonance condition for the
two-spinon excitations.

*Shunsaku Kitagawa,Fumiya Hori,Kenji Ishida,Ryohei Oishi,Yasuyuki Shimura,Takahiro Onimaru,Toshiro Takabatake*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates Ce(Pt_xPd_{1-x})_6Al_3, studying the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic frustration. By varying the Pd content (x), they observe different magnetic states and phase transitions, establishing the material as a platform for exploring these phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of heavy-fermion systems is important for understanding the interplay of Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and quantum criticality. This paper aims to provide insights into how varying elements can affect these complex systems.

Method: The researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance measurements on polycrystalline samples with different Pd concentrations (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3). They analyze Knight shifts, linewidths, and relaxation rates to characterize the magnetic states and phase transitions.

Result: The materials exhibit different magnetic behaviors based on Pd substitution. For x = 0, a paramagnetic heavy-fermion state is observed down to 0.1 K. Substituting Pd induces antiferromagnetic order and suppresses the coherence temperature. At higher Pd concentrations, the system transitions from spin-density-wave antiferromagnetism to more localized moments, crossing the Doniach phase diagram.

Conclusion: Ce(Pt_xPd_{1-x})_6Al_3 serves as a tunable system for exploring the competition between Kondo screening and magnetic frustration, offering insights into materials with heavy fermions and quantum criticality.

Abstract: Heavy-fermion systems with magnetic frustration offer a rich platform for
investigating the interplay among Kondo screening, magnetic frustration, and
quantum criticality. We report comprehensive $^{27}$Al and $^{195}$Pt nuclear
magnetic resonance measurements on polycrystalline
Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$ ($x = 0$, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3). For $x = 0$, the
Knight shift, linewidth, and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate reveal a
paramagnetic heavy-fermion ground state persisting down to 0.1~K, characterized
by a coherence temperature $T_{\mathrm{coh}} \simeq 15$~K. Substituting Pd
induces antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\mathrm{N}} \simeq 3.5$~K, while
suppressing $T_{\mathrm{coh}}$. Comparison between $x = 0.1$ and $x = 0.3$
reveals a crossover from itinerant spin-density-wave antiferromagnetism to more
localized-moment antiferromagnetism, indicating a shift toward the localized
side of the Doniach phase diagram. These findings establish
Ce(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_{x}$)$_6$Al$_3$ as a tunable platform to explore the
competition between Kondo screening and magnetic frustration.

Abstract: Ultrafast disordering observed after photo-excitation challenges the
conventional picture of photo-induced transitions where symmetry-breaking takes
place along a single collective coordinate. We propose that key spectroscopic
signatures of these transient disordered states can be revealed through
stochastic resonance, a hallmark of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Studying the
disordered phase of Holstein model we show that, at given frequency, the linear
response as a function of temperature has a peak, which indicates enhanced
coherent switching between metastable configurations. From this resonance, we
extract the intrinsic stochastic transition timescale and energy barrier
separating equivalent local minima. This mechanism offers a new perspective to
identify and characterize hidden disordered phases in driven many-body systems.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the effects of intrinsic charge-density-waves in 4Hb-TaS2 on flat bands using STM/S and first-principles methods, showing how CDW defects can be manipulated precisely to control electronic properties in a correlated system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the challenge of controlling electron correlation in materials like 4Hb-TaS2, which has intrinsic heterostructures, making it an exciting candidate for novel electronic devices.

Method: They used scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy combined with first-principles calculations to study CDW defects, identify two types based on their effects on flat bands, and demonstrate their manipulation using STM.

Result: The study reveals that sulfur vacancies influence the type of CDW defects, affecting flat band properties, and shows the ability to create and erase these defects with STM.

Conclusion: This work provides a pathway to precisely tune and manipulate the interaction between charge-density waves, lattice, and interlayer coupling in correlated systems, unlocking new possibilities for electronic device applications.

Abstract: Electron correlation is a main driver of exotic quantum phases and their
interplay. The 4Hb-TaS2 system, possessing intrinsic heterostructure of 1T- and
1H-TaS2 monolayers, offers a unique opportunity to control electron correlation
by distorting the atomic lattice or tuning interlayer coupling. Here, we
investigated intrinsically deformed charge-density-waves (CDW) in the 1T layer
of 4Hb-TaS2 to elucidate and control their effects on flat bands using scanning
tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with first-principles
calculations. We identified two types of CDW defects: Type 1 has structural
distortion and locally suppressed flat bands, while Type 2 features an
increased flat band filling factor of intact CDW structure. Density functional
theory calculations indicate that a sulfur vacancy in the 1T layer distorts the
CDW structure and gives rise to a Type 1, whereas a sulfur vacancy in the 1H
layer reduces the interlayer charge transfer and lead to a Type 2. Furthermore,
we demonstrated creating and erasing individual CDW defects via STM
manipulation. Our findings provide a pathway to not only tune flat bands but
also selectively manipulate the interaction between CDW, the atomic lattice,
and interlayer coupling in strongly correlated systems with atomic precision.

Abstract: How thousands of microtubules and molecular motors self-organize into
spindles remains poorly understood. By combining static, nanometer-resolution,
large-scale electron tomography reconstructions and dynamic,
optical-resolution, polarized light microscopy, we test an active liquid
crystal continuum model of mitotic spindles in human tissue culture cells. The
predictions of this coarse-grained theory quantitatively agree with the
experimentally measured spindle morphology and fluctuation spectra. These
findings argue that local interactions and polymerization produce collective
alignment, diffusive-like motion, and polar transport which govern the
behaviors of the spindle's microtubule network, and provide a means to measure
the spindle's material properties. This work demonstrates that a coarse-grained
theory featuring measurable, physically-interpretable parameters can
quantitatively describe the mechanical behavior and self-organization of human
mitotic spindles.

Abstract: We show that momentum-space tensor monopoles corresponding to nontrivial
vector bundle generalizations, known as bundle gerbes, can be realized in bands
of three-dimensional topological matter with nontrivial Hopf invariants. We
provide a universal construction of tensor Berry connections in these
topological phases, demonstrating how obstructions therein lead to
$\mathbb{Z}$-quantized bulk magnetoelectric and nonlinear optical phenomena. We
then pinpoint that these quantum effects are supported by intraband and
interband torsion leading to nontrivial Dixmier-Douady classes in most known
Hopf phases and in more general topological insulators realizing gerbe
invariants falling beyond the tenfold classification of topological phases of
matter. We furthermore provide an interacting generalization upon introducing
many-body gerbe invariants by employing twisted boundary conditions. This opens
an avenue to study gerbe invariants realized through higher-dimensional charge
fractionalizations that can be electromagnetically probed.

Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking motion of chiral phonon-polaritons in LiNbO3
is probed via the ultrafast Faraday effect. By combining a pair of
perpendicularly polarized THz pulses with the right relative delay, we create a
chiral THz driving field to excite chiral phonon-polaritons. The chiral atomic
motion combines with the inverse Faraday effect from the circularly polarized
THz pump to induce a magnetic moment field in the nonmagnetic material, LiNbO3.
We attempt to quantify the strength of the magnetic field with Faraday rotation
probe measurements. The direction of the Faraday signal flips when the input
THz pulse is changed from left- to right-circular polarization, and we estimate
a strong induced magnetic field strength of ~11 Tesla based on the Faraday
rotation.

Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) has emerged as a robust platform for
exploring correlated topological phases, notably supporting fractional Chern
insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field across a wide range of twist
angles. The evolution of magnetism and topology with twist angle remains an
open question. Here, we systematically map the magnetic phase diagram of
tMoTe$_2$ using local optical spectroscopy and scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip (nSOT)
magnetometry. We identify spontaneous ferromagnetism at moir\'e filling factors
$\nu = -1$ and $-3$ over a twist angle range from 2.1$^\circ$ to 3.7$^\circ$,
revealing a universal, twist-angle-insensitive ferromagnetic phase. At
2.1$^\circ$, we further observe robust ferromagnetism at $\nu = -5$, absent in
the devices with larger twist angle -- a signature of the flattening of higher
bands in this twist angle range. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a
contrasting twist-angle dependence of the Curie temperatures between $\nu = -1$
and $\nu = -3$, indicating distinct interplay between exchange interaction and
bandwidth for the two Chern bands. Despite spontaneous time-reversal symmetry
breaking, we find no evidence of a topological gap at $\nu = -3$; however,
fragile correlated topological phases could be obscured by the device disorder
evident in our spatially resolved measurements. Our results establish a global
framework for understanding and controlling magnetic order in tMoTe$_2$ and
highlight its potential for accessing correlated topological phases in higher
energy Chern band.

Motivation: Understanding the thermal Hall effect in materials, particularly how electron-phonon coupling contributes to it.

Method: Derived coupling using Haldane model, calculated thermal Hall conductivity experimentally.

Result: Achieved semi-quantitative agreement with experimental results.

Conclusion: Enhances understanding of electron-phonon coupling's role in thermal transport and offers pathways for material design.

Abstract: Thermal transport acts as a powerful tool for studying the excitations and
physical properties of insulators, where a charge gap suppresses electronic
conduction. Recently, the thermal Hall effect has been observed across various
materials, including insulators and semiconductors, but its fundamental origin
remains unclear. Here, I propose a promising mechanism to explain the emergence
of the thermal Hall effect in these systems: axial chiral phonon skew
scattering mediated by orbital magnetization. Starting from basic principles, I
derive the form and magnitude of the orbital magnetization-phonon coupling
using the well-established Haldane model. Using this coupling, I calculate the
thermal Hall conductivity and Hall angle as functions of temperature, achieving
semi-quantitative agreement with experimental findings. This work enhances our
understanding of the role of electron-phonon coupling in thermal transport and
provides a pathway to tailor thermal properties in a broad range of materials.

Motivation: The study aims to understand how graphene quantum dots aggregate and their collective emission properties on a specific perovskite surface.

Method: Confocal microscopy and spectral analysis under continuous illumination were used to observe fluorescence transitions and changes in excited state lifetimes.

Result: Small clusters form; dynamic emission states observed with varying intensity and lifetimes; possible ordered structures in aggregates.

Conclusion: Depositing C96tBu8 graphene quantum dots on $CH_3NH_3PbBr_3$ leads to cluster formation and dynamic emission behavior, possibly due to ordered aggregates.

Abstract: This study explores the dynamical collective fluorescence of $C_{96}tBu_8$
graphene quantum dots when deposited on the surface of monocrystalline halide
perovskite. Despite the tendency of the graphene quantum dots to avoid
aggregation in solution and polymer matrices, our findings reveal distinct
collective behaviors when deposited on the perovskite surface, here
$CH_3NH_3PbBr_3$. We observed small clusters of graphene quantum dots rather
than isolated single molecules through confocal fluorescence microscopy.
Spectral analysis under continuous illumination shows a back-and-forth
dynamical transition between an uncoupled, monomer-like state and a coupled
state with a redshifted emission. In some cases, this dynamical process is
followed by a drastic one-way increase in fluorescence intensity combined with
a shortening of the excited state lifetime, which could characterize the
emission of ordered graphene quantum dots within aggregates.

Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional
altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological
phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by
altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from
a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we
derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two
critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a
trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases
with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed
purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or
applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for
materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles
calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions,
establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control
in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.

Abstract: Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing
carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in
nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic
$\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with
site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and
incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized
Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker
formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in
magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering
and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an
enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of
$\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC
effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights
establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic
devices through tailored edge engineering.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum confinement in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures, showing that despite mesoscopic uniformity, quantum effects persist. They observed multiple exciton states and unusual emission lifetimes, suggesting new applications in quantum sensing and nonlinear dynamics studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by understanding how quantum confinement affects exciton dynamics in these materials, which could have implications for quantum technology applications.

Method: They used time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy to observe multiple interlayer exciton states and measured emission lifetimes by analyzing energy windows. They performed calculations to support their findings.

Result: Multiple, closely spaced interlayer exciton states were observed with varying emission lifetimes, indicating quantum confinement persists even in reconstructed domains.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that mesoscopic quantum confinement can coexist with nonlinear dynamics, opening new possibilities for quantum sensing and strain engineering applications in dichalcogenide materials.

Abstract: Atomic reconstruction in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide
heterostructures leads to mesoscopic domains with uniform atomic registry,
profoundly altering the local potential landscape. While interlayer excitons in
these domains exhibit strong many-body interactions, extent and impact of
quantum confinement on their dynamics remains unclear. Here, we reveal that
quantum confinement persists in these flat, reconstructed regions.
Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy uncovers multiple, finely-spaced
interlayer exciton states (~ 1 meV separation), and correlated emission
lifetimes spanning sub-nanosecond to over 100 nanoseconds across a 10 meV
energy window. Cascade-like transitions confirm that these states originate
from a single potential well, further supported by calculations. Remarkably, at
high excitation rates, we observe transient suppression of emission followed by
gradual recovery, a process we term "quantum siphoning". Our results
demonstrate that quantum confinement and competing nonlinear dynamics persist
beyond the ideal moire paradigm, potentially enabling applications in quantum
sensing and modifying exciton dynamics via strain engineering.

Abstract: We introduce a bare-bone random matrix quantum impurity model, by hybridizing
a localized spinless electronic level with a bath of random fermions in the
Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). While stripped out of correlations effects,
this model reproduces some salient features of the impurity charge distribution
obtained in previous works on interacting disordered impurity models. Computing
by numerical sampling the impurity charge distribution in our model, we find a
crossover from a Gaussian distribution (centered on half a charge unit) at
large hybridization, to a bimodal distribution (centered both on zero and full
occupations of the charge) at small hybridization. In the bimodal regime, a
universal $(-3/2)$ power-law is also observed. All these findings are very well
accounted for by an analytic surmise computed with a single random electron
level in the bath. We also derive an exact functional integral for the general
probability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenstates, that formally
captures the statistical behavior of our model for any number $N$ of fermionic
orbitals in the bath. In the Gaussian regime and in the limit $N\to\infty$, we
are able to solve exactly the random matrix theory (RMT) for the charge
distribution, obtaining perfect agreement with the numerics. Our results could
be tested experimentally in mesoscopic devices, for instance by coupling a
small quantum dot to a chaotic electronic reservoir, and using a quantum point
contact as local charge sensor for the quantum dot occupation.

phenomena like photon-assisted tunneling and Shapiro steps to the quantum
regime. We predict that the analysis of the supercurrent in such a setup
enables the complete reconstruction of quantum states of the electromagnetic
environment, something that is not possible with normal tunnel junctions.

Abstract: Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the
understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of
topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order
topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different
higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such
topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is
different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states,
and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to
precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI
protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and
third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel
bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we
also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric
HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based
experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we
demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the
unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization.
This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states
in both theory and experiment.

Abstract: In antiferromagnetic spintronics, accessing the spin degree of freedom is
essential for generating spin currents and manipulating magnetic order, which
generally requires lifting spin degeneracy. This is typically achieved through
relativistic spin-orbit coupling or non-relativistic spin splitting in
altermagnets. Here, we propose an alternative approach: a dynamical spin
splitting induced by an optical field in antiferromagnets. By coupling the
driven system to a thermal bath, we demonstrate the emergence of steady-state
pure spin currents, as well as linear-response longitudinal and transverse spin
currents. Crucially, thermal bath engineering allows the generation of a net
spin accumulation without relying on spin-orbit coupling. Our results provide a
broadly applicable and experimentally tunable route to control spins in
antiferromagnets, offering new opportunities for spin generation and
manipulation in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of a novel eigenstate in a strongly dipolar
binary $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture, where the inter- and intraspecies dipolar
lengths are larger than the corresponding scattering lengths. When this mixture
is confined by a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap, the total density
exhibits the formation of droplets on a spatially-symmetric triangular or
square lattice, where each droplet is formed of a single species of atoms; two
types of atoms never exist on the same lattice site. The density of any of the
species shows a partially-filled incomplete lattice, only the total density
exhibits a completely full lattice structure. In this theoretical investigation
we employ the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a
Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction in the intraspecies components alone, meant to
stop a collapse of the atoms at high atom density.

Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two
Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this
setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ}

tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes
drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we
propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type
quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on
Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of
Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body

Abstract: Quantum state control is a fundamental tool for quantum technologies. In this
work, we propose and analyze the use of quantum optimal control that exploits
the dipolar interaction of ultracold atoms on a lattice ring, focusing on the
generation of selected states with entangled circulation. This scheme requires
time-dependent control over the orientation of the magnetic field, a technique
that is feasible in ultracold atom laboratories. The system's evolution is
driven by just two independent control functions. We describe the symmetry
constraints and other requirements of this approach, and numerically test them
using the extended Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the proposed control can
engineer entangled current states with perfect fidelity across a wide range of
systems, and that in the remaining cases, the theoretical upper bounds for
fidelity are reached.

Abstract: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in
the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed
where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in
conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so
far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate
the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and
the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions.
Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to
obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both
generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler
class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two
dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the
possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We
establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns
according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant,
highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by
building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical
consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice
Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically
confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss
possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to
study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap
topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher
dimensions.

Abstract: Neutrinos, elusive and abundant, interact weakly with matter, making
detection challenging. This thesis explores neutrino physics, focusing on mass
hierarchy and oscillations, with emphasis on India's upcoming INO facility. The
Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, using Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) within
magnetized iron plates, aims to resolve neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely
measure $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$, potentially revealing new physics.
The study advances RPC development through simulation techniques. A
straight-line model calculates space charge effects during avalanche or
streamer processes, improving electric field estimation speed and accuracy.
Polarization effects in dielectric electrodes are analyzed, elucidating
electric field dependence on electrode parameters. A new class, pAvalancheMC,
integrated into Garfield++ software, combines straight-line and image charge
models to simulate space charge effects. Using OpenMP for parallel computing,
it achieves significant speed-ups in electron-ion pair generation and space
charge field calculations. Practically, an eight-RPC stack was developed at
VECC to measure cosmic muon scattering angles in high-density materials. A
testbench evaluates efficiency, crosstalk, and hit uniformity. A reconstruction
algorithm, validated with data from the IICHEP stack in Madurai, supports the
VECC stack's potential. This work enhances neutrino physics understanding and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is to maintain high magnetic field accuracy in stellarator coils with manufacturing complexities.

Method: They measured deviations from 3D scans using Gaussian processes and performed statistical analysis.

Result: CNC-machined frames have much smaller manufacturing errors than additive manufacturing, leading to better field accuracy.

Conclusion: Using CNC-machined parts improves both field precision and assembly efficiency for HTS stellarator coils.

Abstract: Stellarator coils are known for their complexity and departure from
planarity, along with tight manufacturing tolerances in order to achieve the
target magnetic field accuracy. These requirements can lead to increased costs
and delays in assembly; failure to meet them can compromise the stellarator's
performance. Small-scale experiments offer opportunities to develop and
benchmark stellarator coil design and evaluation methods more quickly and at
lower budget. In this work, we analyze precise 3D scans of the manufacturing
deviations of two 3D-printed coil frames (steel, Ti alloy) and one CNC-machined
coil frame (Al alloy), as part of assessing these approaches to fabricating
high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils for a tabletop stellarator. The
deviations are measured along the coil length, then modeled using Gaussian
processes to extract characteristic length scales. Finally a statistical study
of field accuracy is performed using relevant experimental parameters. We
conclude that the manufacturing perturbations along the winding path from
CNC-machining are almost an order of magnitude lower than those from Additive
Manufacturing. Together with high overall fabrication accuracy, this allows for
higher magnetic field precision and an improved assembly process.

Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic
itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering
algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by
means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems,
we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states
using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on
examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of
residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with
the help of some statistical tests. The effectiveness of these methods is
demonstrated on two systems that serve as well-known models exhibiting chaotic
itinerancy: globally coupled logistic maps (GCM) and mutually coupled Gaussian
maps. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number
of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics
observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as the coherent and
intermittent phases.

Abstract: Nonlinear processes lie at the heart of many technologies such as frequency
converters and entangled photon sources. Historically, observation and
manipulation of these processes, for instance through nanostructures, has been
limited to optical and lower frequencies. Recently, however, second-order
nonlinear processes which couple X-ray and optical photons have been observed
and used to probe the electronic structure and optical response of materials.
Observing and controlling these processes remains challenging due to their low
efficiency and the difficulty of fabricating devices with spatial features on
the scale of X-ray wavelengths. Here, we show how optical nanostructures can be
used to manipulate X-ray/optical nonlinear processes, using a quantum theory
which describes these second-order nonlinear interactions. As an example, we
show how photonic crystals shape both the spectral and spatial characteristics
of X-rays emitted through X-ray to optical parametric down-conversion, leading
to a fill-factor-normalized rate enhancement of 2.2 over an unstructured
medium, in addition to control over the directionality of X-ray emission. The
ability to control X-ray nonlinear processes may lead to more monochromatic,
heralded X-ray sources, enhanced ghost imaging of lattice and electronic
dynamics, and imaging and spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit. Our
framework illuminates a path towards controlling quantum optical effects at
X-ray frequencies.

*Yunong Sun*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for imaging through scattering media called NeOTF. It uses neural networks and physical priors to learn the system's OTF, resulting in accurate and efficient reconstructions. Experiments show better performance than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging through scattering media is hard because of the ill-posed nature of the problem. This requires new approaches to handle such challenges, making the method more practical for real-world applications.

Method: The NeOTF framework uses a neural network to learn the optical transfer function (OTF) implicitly. It optimizes multi-frame speckle intensities and incorporates a physical Fourier-domain OTF prior. This approach enables deconvolution for object reconstruction.

Result: Simulations and experiments show NeOTF's superiority in accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods.

Conclusion: NeOTF provides a practical solution for real-time scattering imaging by effectively learning and utilizing the OTF.

Abstract: Imaging through scattering media via speckle correlation is fundamentally
challenged by ill-posed reconstruction. To overcome this, we bypass direct
object recovery and instead target the system's deterministic optical transfer
function (OTF). We introduce NeOTF, a framework that learns an implicit neural
representation of the OTF. By optimizing this representation using multi-frame
speckle intensities and a physical Fourier-domain prior, NeOTF robustly
retrieves the system's OTF. Subsequent deconvolution with this retrieved OTF
yields high-fidelity object reconstructions. Both simulations and experiments
demonstrate that NeOTF achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over
conventional methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
scattering imaging.

Abstract: The rapid development of AR/VR, remote sensing, satellite radar, and medical
equipment has created an imperative demand for ultra efficient image
compression and reconstruction that exceed the capabilities of electronic
processors. For the first time, we demonstrate an end to end image compression
and reconstruction approach using an optoelectronic computing
processor,achieving orders of magnitude higher speed and lower energy
consumption than electronic counterparts. At its core is a 32X32 silicon
photonic computing chip, which monolithically integrates 32 high speed
modulators, 32 detectors, and a programmable photonic matrix core, copackaged
with all necessary control electronics (TIA, ADC, DAC, FPGA etc.). Leveraging
the photonic matrix core programmability, the processor generates trainable
compressive matrices, enabling adjustable image compression ratios (from 2X to
256X) to meet diverse application needs. Deploying a custom lightweight
photonic integrated circuit oriented network (LiPICO-Net) enables high quality
reconstruction of compressed images. Our approach delivers an end to end
latency of only 49.5ps/pixel while consuming only less than 10.6nJ/pixel-both
metrics representing 2-3 orders of magnitude improvement compared with
classical models running on state-of-the-art GPUs. We validate the system on a
130 million-pixel aerial imagery, enabling real time compression where
electronic systems falter due to power and latency constraints. This work not
only provides a transformative solution for massive image processing but also
opens new avenues for photonic computing applications.

Abstract: Heterogeneous networks provide a universal framework for extracting
subsystem-level features of a complex system, which are critical in graph
colouring, pattern classification, and motif identification. When abstracting
physical systems into networks, distinct groups of nodes and links in
heterogeneous networks can be decomposed into different modes of multipartite
networks, allowing for a deeper understanding of both intra- and inter-group
relationships. Here, we develop heterogeneous network modelling of wave
scattering to engineer multiphase random heterogeneous materials. We devise
multipartite network decomposition determined by material phases, which is
examined using uni- and bi-partite network examples for two-phase multiparticle
systems. We show that the directionality of the bipartite network governs the
phase-sensitive alteration of microstructures. The proposed modelling enables a
network-based design to achieve phase-sensitive microstructural features, while
almost preserving the overall scattering response. With examples of designing
quasi-isoscattering stealthy hyperuniform materials, our results provide a
general recipe for engineering multiphase materials for wave functionalities.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) represents a transformative visualization
approach for next-generation immersive virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR)
displays, enabling precise wavefront modulation and naturally providing
comprehensive physiological depth cues without the need for bulky optical
assemblies. Despite significant advancements in computational algorithms
enhancing image quality and achieving real-time generation, practical
implementations of holographic near-eye displays (NEDs) continue to face
substantial challenges arising from finite and dynamically varying pupil
apertures, which degrade image quality and compromise user experience. In this
study, we introduce an eyepiece-free pupil-optimized holographic NED. Our
proposed method employs a customized spherical phase modulation strategy to
generate multiple viewpoints within the pupil, entirely eliminating the
dependence on conventional optical eyepieces. Through the joint optimization of
amplitude and phase distributions across these viewpoints, the method markedly
mitigates image degradation due to finite pupil sampling and resolves
inapparent depth cues induced by the spherical phase. The demonstrated method
signifies a substantial advancement toward the realization of compact,
lightweight, and flexible holographic NED systems, fulfilling stringent
requirements for future VR/AR display technologies.

Abstract: Optical tactile sensing holds transformative potential for robotics,
particularly in collaborative environments where touch perception enhances
safety, adaptability, and cognitive interaction. However, traditional tactile
technologies based on total internal reflection (TIR) and frustrated total
internal reflection (FTIR) - such as those used in touchscreen systems - face
significant limitations. These include reliance on multiple infrared light
sources and cameras, as well as poor adaptability to the complex, curved
geometries often found in robotic systems. To address these challenges, we
recently introduced OptoSkin, an advanced optical tactile sensor based on
direct Time-of-Flight (ToF) technology, enabling touch and pressure detection.
In this study, we investigate how specific material properties, particularly
light scattering, influence the sensitivity of contact point detection under
direct ToF sensing. Four materials with distinct scattering coefficients were
selected to assess their impact on signal quality across different contact
scenarios involving various target surfaces.

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new class of optomechanical nonlinearities in
weakly damped micromechanical resonators, arising from the interplay between
the Duffing nonlinearity, intermodal coupling, and thermal fluctuations. Within
the bistable regime of a single Duffing mode driven by radiation pressure
forces, we observe stochastically generated sidebands, originating from thermal
fluctuations around equilibrium trajectories in phase space, and exploit these
sidebands to induce probabilistic transitions between bistable states using
weak secondary acoustic excitation. Extending this framework to multimodal
interactions, we show that nonlinear modes coupling within the same resonator
leads to similar transitions due to parametric modulation around the
noise-excited sidebands as a result of frequency mixing. Simultaneously, abrupt
changes in displacements of modes cause their instantaneous energy exchange
rates to span five orders of magnitude. These findings open new avenues for
reconfigurable optomechanical networks, nonreciprocal energy transport, and
precision sensing based on dynamically tunable mechanical nonlinearities.

Abstract: Single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) using intense XUV and soft
X-ray pulses holds the promise to deliver information on the three dimensional
shape as well as the optical properties of nano-scale objects in a single
diffraction image. This advantage over conventional X-ray diffraction methods
comes at the cost of a much more complex description of the underlying
scattering process due to the importance of wide-angle scattering and
propagation effects.The commonly employed reconstruction of the sample
properties via iterative forward fitting of diffraction patterns requires an
accurate and fast method to simulate the scattering process. This work
introduces the propagation multi-slice Fourier transform method (pMSFT) and
demonstrates its superior performance and accuracy against existing methods for
wide-angle scattering. A derivation from first principles, a unified physical
picture of the approximations underlying pMSFT and the existing methods, as
well as a systematic benchmark that provides qualified guidance for the
selection of the appropriate scattering method is presented.

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures (VdWHs) composed of 2D materials have
attracted significant attention in recent years due to their intriguing optical
properties, such as strong light-matter interactions and large intrinsic
anisotropy. In particular, VdWHs support a variety of polaritons-hybrid
quasiparticles arising from the coupling between electromagnetic waves and
material excitations-enabling the confinement of electromagnetic radiation to
atomic scales. The ability to predict and simulate the optical response of 2D
materials heterostructures is thus of high importance, being commonly performed
until now via methods such as the TMM, or Fresnel equations. While straight
forward, these often yield long and complicated expressions, limiting intuitive
and simple access to the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the optical
response. In this work, we demonstrate the adaptation of the transmission line
model for VdWHs, based on expressing its constituents by distributed electrical
circuit elements described by their admittance. Since the admittance carries
fundamental physical meaning of the material response to electromagnetic
fields, the approach results in a system of propagating voltage and current
waves, offering a compact and physically intuitive formulation that simplifies
algebraic calculations, clarifies the conditions for existence of physical
solutions, and provides valuable insight into the fundamental physical
response. To demonstrate this, we derive the transmission line analogs of bulk
to monolayer 2D materials and show it can be used to compute the
reflection/transmission coefficients, polaritonic dispersion relations, and
electromagnetic field distributions in a variety of VdWHs, and compare them to
experimental measurements yielding very good agreement. This method provides a
valuable tool for exploring and understanding the optical response of layered
2D systems.

Abstract: Highly transparent and conductive electrodes operating in the infrared (IR)
are critically needed for a broad range of technologies, including
light-emitting diodes, lasers and photodetectors, which are key building blocks
of infrared cameras, LiDARs, and thermal systems such as IR heaters. While
transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) have seen substantial progress in the
visible spectrum, their performance in the IR remains limited due to increased
absorption and reflection caused by the plasma resonance of free carriers in
conductive materials. Here, we demonstrate a large-area TCE based on a
metal-integrated monolithic high-contrast grating (metalMHCG) fabricated on a
GaAs substrate. This structure acts as an effective antireflection coating,
achieving near-unity transmission of unpolarized mid- to far-infrared (M-FIR)
light. The metalMHCG exhibits 94% transmission at a wavelength of 7
micrometers, corresponding to 135% relative to transmission through a flat
GaAs-air interface, while maintaining an exceptionally low sheet resistance of
2.8 ohms per square. By simultaneously delivering excellent optical

performance benchmark among M-FIR TCEs and provides a versatile platform for
next-generation high-power optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: Remote excitation using guided optical modes -- such as waveguides, fibers,
or surface waves -- offers a promising alternative to direct optical excitation
for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), particularly in applications
requiring reduced heating, minimal invasiveness, and on-chip integration.
However, despite its widespread use, systematic comparisons between remote and
direct excitation remain limited. Here, we quantitatively benchmark both
schemes by measuring power-dependent SERS responses from individual plasmonic
nanogaps. We statistically analyze the maximum achievable SERS intensity before
structural degradation, extract local temperatures, and evaluate
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our findings reveal that both remote and direct
SERS share a common electric-field limit, despite exhibiting different levels
of heating. This suggests that spectral evolution is primarily governed by the
local electric field, which drives nanoscale atomic migration rather than
excessive heating. Nonetheless, the lower heating associated with remote
excitation enhances the Raman SNR by approximately 30%, improving measurement
quality without compromising signal strength. This study establishes a
quantitative framework for evaluating excitation strategies in plasmonic
sensing, and challenges common assumptions about the role of heating in
nanostructural stability under strong optical excitation.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the viability of all-inorganic, lead-free tandem solar cells as a sustainable energy solution, highlighting their potential for integrating into next-generation photovoltaics.

Abstract: The pursuit of sustainable and highly efficient energy conversion
necessitates a transition from toxic and unstable materials to environmentally
friendly alternatives. This work presents a simulation-based numerical
investigation of a fully inorganic, lead-free tandem solar cell that employs
cesium tin-germanium tri-iodide (CsSnGeI3) as the top cell absorber and
crystalline silicon (c-Si) as the bottom cell absorber, configured in a silicon
heterojunction (SHJ) arrangement. Utilizing CsSnGeI3 as a lead-free perovskite
presents a promising solution to the toxicity concerns associated with
conventional lead-based perovskites. To further increase near-infrared
absorption and reduce the required thickness of the c-Si layer, an ultra-thin
gallium antimonide auxiliary absorber is integrated into the SHJ bottom cell.
Optical and electrical simulations, conducted using finite-difference
time-domain and drift-diffusion modelling, demonstrate that the optimized
tandem structure attains a power conversion efficiency of 34.93%, surpassing
the Shockley-Queisser limit established for single-junction Si cells.
Furthermore, the optimized device showcases an open-circuit voltage of 1.93 V,
a short-circuit current density of 21.30 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 84.74%.
Performance is additionally enhanced by incorporating cylindrical gold nanorods
within a Si3N4 dielectric medium positioned at the rear of the bottom cell,
thus amplifying light absorption through plasmonic effects. Notably, the tandem
cell sustains high efficiency even without the plasmonic structure, thereby
providing flexibility for cost-effective fabrication. This work underscores the
viability of all-inorganic, lead-free tandem cells for next-generation
photovoltaics, guided by simulated results that pave the way for
high-efficiency, non-toxic solar energy solutions and further experimental
validation.

TL;DR: The paper compares two beamsplitter coatings for gravitational wave interferometers, evaluating their performance in splitting light and maintaining phase shifts between orthogonal polarizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors, reducing back-action noise requires efficient polarization-based speedometers. Beamsplitters with optimal reflectivity and phase stability are crucial. The study compares two coatings to find the best option for these applications.

Method: The researchers experimented with two coatings from different manufacturers, analyzing their power reflection and phase shifts across various angles. Laseroptik's 22-layer coating achieved high reflectivity, while Optoman's thinner coating reduced the differential phase shift, which is important for maintaining phase coherence.

Result: Both coatings perform as expected. Laseroptik's coating shows high power reflection but slight phase differences, whereas Optoman's coating has balanced power but small differential phase shifts.

Conclusion: Using a 22-layer layered structure with Ta2O5 and SiO2 may be beneficial for a certain signal, while a thinner coating with optimized materials offers better phase stability, making it suitable depending on the specific noise reduction needs.

Abstract: Optical beamsplitters with similar properties for orthogonal, linear
polarisation modes are required for realising polarisation-based speedmeter
schemes to reduce back-action noise in gravitational-wave interferometers. In
this paper, we investigate two beamsplitter coatings obtained from Laseroptik
GmbH and Optoman on a best-effort basis that aim for a 50/50 power splitting
ratio and equal overall phase shift for two orthogonal, linear polarisation
modes interacting with the optic. We show that while Laseroptik GmbH opted for
coating stack with 22 alternating layers of Ta2O5 and SiO2, Optoman produced a
much thinner coating made of 5 SiO2 and SiOx (0 < x < 2) layers. With these
strategies, the Laseroptik coating achieves an equal power reflectivity of 51%
at 46 deg angle of incidence, and zero phase shift between both polarisations
at 44.25 deg angle of incidence. The Optoman coating achieves power
reflectivities of 49% for s-polarisation and 51% for p-polarisation with a
differential phase shift around 5 deg largely independent of the angle of
incidence.

TL;DR: This paper explores non-commutative formal geometry in discrete integrable systems, introducing a q-Painleve equation labeled q-P(A3) as a non-commutative analog of the sixth q-Painleve equation. Using extended birational representations of the extended affine Weyl group and Sakai's surface theory, they derive this system and connect it to other non-commutative Painleve systems. The paper's approach bridges commutative and non-commutative aspects of integrable systems, contributing to a deeper understanding of discrete Painleve equations. The cascade structure of multiplicative discrete Painleve equations is expanded upon, and connections to non-Abelian systems are established.Overall, the paper provides a solid foundation for studying non-commutative integrable systems using geometric and group-theoretic methods.

Motivation: The paper addresses the burgeoning interest in non-commutative integrable systems, a field that has gained momentum with the rise of quantum and non-commutative geometry in mathematical physics. Discrete Painleve equations are fundamental in describing nonlinear phenomena, and their non-commutative analogs are crucial for modeling quantum systems and non-commutative spaces. This work contributes to understanding the structure and properties of such systems, potentially leading to new insights and applications in both mathematics and physics.

Method: The authors employ an extended birational representation of the extended affine Weyl group and utilize Sakai's surface theory. By postulating this representation and selecting the same translation element as in the commutative case, they construct the non-commutative discrete integrable system labeled q-P(A3). They further develop a non-commutative version of Sakai's theory, leading to birational representations, and explore connections with other non-commutative Painleve systems.

Result: The main result is the successful construction of the non-commutative discrete integrable system q-P(A3) using group theory and geometric methods. Additionally, they establish connections between q-P(A3) and other non-commutative systems, thereby broadening the understanding of the structure of discrete Painleve equations in a non-commutative setting. The paper demonstrates the power of combining group-theoretic and geometric approaches in studying non-commutative integrable systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the non-commutative formal geometry provides a robust framework for analyzing discrete integrable systems. By introducing q-P(A3) and linking it to other non-commutative systems, the authors advance the understanding of discrete Painleve equations in non-commutative contexts. This work opens new avenues for research in non-commutative integrable systems, potentially leading to their applications in quantum mathematics and related fields.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe the non-commutative formal geometry underlying a
certain class of discrete integrable systems. Our main example is a
non-commutative analog, labeled $q-P(A_{3})$, of the sixth $q$-Painleve
equation. The system $q-P(A_{3})$ is constructed by postulating an extended
birational representation of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}$ of
type $D_5^{(1)}$ and by selecting the same translation element in
$\widetilde{W}$ as in the commutative case. Starting from this non-commutative
discrete system, we develop a non-commutative version of Sakai's surface
theory, which allows us to derive the same birational representation that we
initially postulated. Moreover, we recover the well-known cascade of
multiplicative discrete Painleve equations rooted in $q-P(A_{4})$ and establish
a connection between $q-P(A_{3})$ and the non-commutative $d$-Painleve systems
introduced in I. Bobrova. Affine Weyl groups and non-Abelian discrete systems:
an application to the d-Painlev´e equations.
