Abstract: Accurately predicting friction in sliding interfaces that contain third body
wear particles is critical for engineering applications such as sliding
movement in pistons, bearings, or metal forming. We present a hierarchical
multiscale framework that links particle scale mechanics to macroscopic
friction in a strip draw friction test. At the macroscale, a one dimensional
finite element model reproduces the global stress state of the strip draw setup
and updates the local wear particle density via Archard's law. The local
friction force at each node is then computed from mesoscale simulation results.
At the mesoscale, a coupled discrete element boundary element approach resolves
load sharing between rough surfaces and rigid oblate spheroidal wear particles.
The mesoscale solution returns to the macroscale solver a friction coefficient
that depends on normal pressure, sliding velocity, surface geometry, and
particle density, thereby closing the loop between scales. The simulated
friction coefficient matches strip draw experiments, capturing both the
observed decrease in friction with increasing normal pressure and the influence
of tool pad size.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a solid-state nanopore system using MIPs for the multiplexed detection and release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, GABAB, and histamine with high spatial-temporal resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing high-resolution multiplexed detection systems for neurochemical sensing and bio-computation is crucial for advancing understanding in neuroscience and nanotechnology.

Method: The authors developed a nanopore array where each pore is functionalized with a specific MIP to recognize neurotransmitters. They designed micro-chambers to prevent signal cross-talk and demonstrated controlled release of molecules.

Result: The system achieved exceptional performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, recovery, and stability, with high multiplexed spatiotemporal resolution.

Conclusion: This innovative approach opens new possibilities in real-time label-free sensing and bio-computing using solid-state nanopores.

Abstract: In nanopore technology, the development of multiplexed detection and release
platforms with high spatial and temporal resolution remains a significant
challenge due to the difficulty in distinguishing signals originating from
different nanopores in a single chip. In this work, we present a solid-state
nanopore system functionalized with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for
the selective detection and controlled release of neurotransmitters. We
designed a nanopore array where each nanopore is functionalized with a specific
MIP able to recognize specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric
acid, and histamine, respectively). The platform demonstrated high performance
in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, recovery, and stability. Multiplexed
detection with high spatiotemporal resolution of the order of 100 ms/ 3 {\mu}m
was achieved by specifically depositing MIPs and conductive hydrogels on
different nanopores prepared on a single solid-state membrane. The employment
of micro-chambers for each nanopore prevented signal cross-talk, thereby
enabling simultaneous detection and release of multiple neurotransmitters.
Moreover, we demonstrated computing with different logic gates and in-edge
computing. This nanopore platform represents a radically novel approach towards
hybrid solid-state nanopores able to perform real-time label-free multiplex
detection, controlled biomolecule release, and ionic logic computing,
addressing key challenges in neurochemical sensing and bio-computation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了纯量子系统是否能满足与智能体相关的三个基本条件，包括构建世界模型、评估行动的影响以及可靠地执行最大化期望效用的动作。该论文指出，前两个条件与量子克隆定理相冲突，因为克隆定理禁止从环境中复制未知的量子状态，从而导致构建世界模型和评估行动影响时的困难。此外，第三个条件也因量子动力学的线性性质而无法满足。论文指出这些结果带来了几个主要后果：智能体需要显著的古典资源；它们提供了经典智能体如何在量子宇宙中产生的见解；与此同时，它们表明量子计算机无法直接模拟智能体行为，而需要经典的组件；此外，它们挑战了量子理论对智能体、自由意志和意识的理解。

Motivation: 该研究旨在探索在完全量子化、无 decoherence 或 collapse 的环境中，智能体是否能够存在。这是一个基础性问题，关系到我们如何理解智能体的本质和局限性。

Method: 论文采用形式化的理论分析方法，结合量子力学的基本原理和克隆定理来探讨智能体的存在条件。通过构建理论模型和分析矛盾，得出结论。

Result: 论文得出结论：在纯量子系统中，智能体无法满足与智能体相关的三个基本条件。具体而言，构建世界模型和评估行动影响需要量子克隆，而这与克隆定理相矛盾。此外，量子力学的线性性质也导致无法可靠执行最大化期望效用的动作。

Conclusion: 智能体的存在需要显著的经典资源，而纯量子系统无法满足智能体的本质需求，这暗示着智能体的物理基础必须包含经典元素。

Abstract: What are the physical requirements for agency? We investigate whether a
purely quantum system (one evolving unitarily in a coherent regime without
decoherence or collapse) can satisfy three minimal conditions for agency: an
agent must be able to create a world-model, use it to evaluate the likely
consequences of alternative actions, and reliably perform the action that
maximizes expected utility. We show that the first two conditions conflict with
the no-cloning theorem, which forbids copying unknown quantum states:
world-model construction requires copying information from the environment, and
deliberation requires copying the world-model to assess multiple actions.
Approximate cloning strategies do not permit sufficient fidelity or generality
for agency to be viable in purely quantum systems. The third agency condition
also fails due to the linearity of quantum dynamics. These results imply four
key consequences. First, agency requires significant classical resources,
placing clear constraints on its physical basis. Second, they provide insight
into how classical agents emerge within a quantum universe. Third, they show
that quantum computers cannot straightforwardly simulate agential behavior
without significant classical components. Finally, they challenge quantum
theories of agency, free will, and consciousness.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$,
to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state
$|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A
common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength
schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the
excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on
the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we
report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the
two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to
the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to
resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We
also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for
stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a novel implementation of lambda-enhanced gray molasses cooling in
a non-standard beam geometry and with an inexpensive laser locking set-up. In
contrast to the established use of resource-intensive phase locking methods,
our laser system uses two independent lasers, frequency -locked to a spectral
feature produced by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
resonance. We show that this approach achieves sufficient coherence to enable
effective gray molasses cooling without the need for costly GHz electronics,
significantly reducing the complexity and cost of experimental setups and
represents a step toward more accessible cold atom technologies. A
wave-function Monte Carlo analysis supports the experimental findings, offering
insight into the cooling dynamics of this unconventional scheme

TL;DR: 研究了无序二维原子阵列的集体发光现象，发现即使在很强的无序情况下，系统仍然表现出类似完美无序时的超辐射特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解无序系统中的量子光学现象对于分析和设计真实系统的光子学性能至关重要。

Method: 使用大规模半经典仿真方法，结合解析变分估计，探索不同无序程度对集体发光特性的影响。

Result: 无论无序强度如何，系统的集体发光特性仍保留基本特征，但在有限规模下表现出更强的无序效应。 Use this method, we find that even with strong disorder, the system still exhibits superradiant-like behavior, but the decay mechanism is significantly modified by disorder.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解复杂量子光学系统提供了新的视角, 并为设计新型光子器件提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study the collective emission of a disordered array of $N$ excited
two-level atoms into a one-dimensional photonic waveguide. In the perfectly
ordered case, where atoms are spaced by exact integer multiples of the
wavelength, the system exhibits the characteristic superradiant burst with a
peak emission rate scaling as $N^2$. Using large-scale semiclassical
simulations, we find that this key signature of superradiance remains
asymptotically robust under strong spatial and spectral disorder, but also
exhibits subtle finite-size scaling toward this limit. To explain our
observations, we provide an analytical variational estimate for the maximal
decay rate, which tightly bounds the numerical results and reveals how disorder
shapes the collective decay. Specifically, we find that even in the presence of
strong disorder, the spins tend to self-organize spontaneously according to
their locations, which overall optimizes constructive interference effects and
explains the emergence of mirror-asymmetric correlations in superradiant decay.
These findings resolve important open questions regarding the existence and
nature of superradiance in strongly disordered arrays and offer valuable
insights for understanding collective quantum optical phenomena in realistic
systems.

Abstract: We establish a finite-time quantum tricycle driven by an external field and
investigate its thermodynamic performance in the slow-driving regime. By
developing a perturbative expansion of heat with respect to operation time, we
capture the dynamics of heat exchange processes beyond the quasistatic limit.
Within a geometric framework, we derive fundamental bounds on trade-offs
between the cooling rate, coefficient of performance, and dissipation, governed
by the thermodynamic length and trajectory geometry in control space. Our
findings unveil intrinsic limits to the performance of quantum thermal machines
and highlight the role of geometry in shaping finite-time thermodynamics. This
work advances the fundamental understanding of quantum thermodynamic processes
and offers guiding principles for the design of next-generation quantum

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，在强外场下，一维带有长程相互作用的XYZ模型可以在预热过程中表现出量子马currently effects（QME），而这种情况仅在相互作用具有足够短程时成立。这些结果为实验测试提供了平台。


<details>

Motivation: 探索长程相互作用如何影响量子马currently效应（QME）的存在条件，以便在实验中进行测试。

Method: 使用一维XYZ模型，引入长程相互作用，研究不同相互作用范围与外场对QME的影响。

Result: 当相互作用足够短程时，QME能在预热过程中出现；否则，不会出现。

Conclusion: 长程相互作用的存在与否显著影响了QME的出现，验证了理论预测。

Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of
equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems
initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in
terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically
restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ
model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field.
In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system
develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due
to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when
interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between
the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We
systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on
the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the
tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in
experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers.

### [9] [Censorship of quantum resources against catalytic account sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12876)
*Julien Pinske,Klaus Mølmer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum censorship and its implications for quantum network security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by concerns about the security of quantum networks.

Method: The paper introduces new censorship protocols that do not require perfect erasure of quantum resources and investigates the conditions under which these protocols are secure.

Result: The protocols provide a novel approach to quantum network security, different from existing methods such as quantum and post-quantum cryptography.

Conclusion: The paper suggests that resource-censored quantum networks can offer enhanced security compared to networks without censorship, but further research is needed to fully understand the implications.

Abstract: In quantum censorship, an agency oversees quantum communication in a
public-domain network. The agency restricts the users communication to the free
states of a quantum resource theory (QRT). Despite quantum correlations being
fragile, any realistic censorship leaves behind some quantumness, raising
concerns that censorship may be overcome through revival or distillation of
quantum resources. Here, we introduce censorship protocols that do not require
a perfect erasure of a quantum resource, but rather deem censorship successful
if users are unable to restore the original quantum state using free
operations. We investigate under which conditions censorship is secure, and
when it might fail. Moreover, we address the issue of account sharing in
quantum networks, wherein independent parties assist in transmitting quantum
resources to censored users. This connects resource censorship to timely topics
such as quantum catalysis and resource-assisted communication. Censorship
protocols offer a novel perspective on quantum network security, that differs
fundamentally from existing approaches such as quantum and post-quantum
cryptography.

### [10] [Observation of area laws in an interacting quantum field simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13783)
*Maciej T. Jarema,Mohammadamin Tajik,Jörg Schmiedmayer,Silke Weinfurtner,Tobias Haas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that mutual information follows the area law in quantum systems, even those with strong interactions, at finite temperatures. It achieves this by using cold atom simulators and measures mutual information, subsystem scaling, and non-Gaussian correlations via relative entropy. The approach is data-driven and model-agnostic, making it broadly applicable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how correlations behave in quantum systems is a fundamental question in physics. The area law provides a basis for understanding quantum entanglement and its role in quantum matter and spacetime. While the area law is well-understood in non-interacting systems, proving it in interacting systems presents significant challenges. This paper addresses this gap by experimentally verifying the area law in interacting quantum systems.

Method: The researchers used ultra-cold atom simulators of quantum fields with tunable interaction strength. They measured mutual information between subsystems by reconstructing density matrices from quantum states. They also used relative entropy to quantify non-Gaussian correlations. The method was data-driven and model-agnostic, allowing it to be applied to other platforms and observables.

Result: The study confirms that mutual information follows the area law even in interacting quantum systems at finite temperatures. It shows that mutual information scales with boundary area rather than subsystem volume. The researchers also quantified non-Gaussian correlations using relative entropy, which was essential for understanding the deviations from Gaussian statistics in interacting systems. The results highlight the universality of the area law beyond non-interacting systems.

Conclusion: This experiment opens new avenues for studying quantum correlations in high-dimensional systems. By demonstrating the area law in interacting quantum systems, the paper bridges a significant gap in our understanding of quantum entanglement. The data-driven approach provides a model-agnostic tool for probing information in various quantum systems, which could lead to new insights into quantum matter and spacetime structure.

Abstract: Information shared between parties quantifies their correlation. The encoding
of correlations across space and time characterises the structure, history, and
interactions of systems. One of the most fundamental properties that emerges
from studies of information is the area law, which states that information
shared between spatial subregions typically scales with the area of their
boundary rather than their volume. In non-interacting, quantum many-body
systems, where Gaussian statistics apply, the scaling of information measures
is well understood. Within interacting systems, the readout of information
measures is impeded by the complexity of state reconstruction. As such, no
measurements beyond small quantum systems (e.g., composed of few, localised
particles) have been made. Here, we fill this gap by experimentally
demonstrating the area law of mutual information in an ultra-cold atom
simulator of quantum fields with tuneable interaction strength. Our results
detail the scaling of mutual information with subsystem volume, boundary area,
and separation between spatial regions at finite temperature. Moreover, we
quantify the total effect of non-Gaussian correlations using an
information-theoretic measure - relative entropy. Our presented approach is
data-driven, model agnostic, and readily applicable to other platforms and
observables, thus constituting a universal toolkit for probing information in
high-dimensional quantum systems and its role in shaping quantum matter and
spacetime.

Conclusion: 该研究为Quantum Information and Computation领域的贡献是通过量化复杂性来辅助分析和比较信道性能。

Abstract: The statistical complexity of continuous-variable quantum states can be
characterized with a quantifier defined in terms of information-theoretic
quantities derived from the Husimi Q-function. In this work, we utilize this
complexity quantifier of quantum states to study the complexity of single-mode
bosonic quantum channels. We define the complexity of quantum channels as the
maximal amount of complexity they can generate from an initial state with the
minimal complexity. We illustrate this concept by evaluating the complexity of
Gaussian channels and some examples of non-Gaussian channels.

Result: 允许两比特经典通信可模拟所有某些状态，但仅凭测量结果无法模拟投影测量下的所有情况。

Conclusion: 经典通信的限制会影响其解释量子非局域的能力。

Abstract: A central aspect of quantum information is that correlations between
spacelike separated observers sharing entangled states cannot be reproduced by
local hidden variable (LHV) models, a phenomenon known as Bell nonlocality. If
one wishes to explain such correlations by classical means, a natural
possibility is to allow communication between the parties. In particular, LHV
models augmented with two bits of classical communication can explain the
correlations of any two-qubit state. Would this still hold if communication is
restricted to measurement outcomes? While in certain scenarios with a finite
number of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all
projective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In
fact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with
outcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without
communication. On the other hand, we also show that when restricted sets of
measurements are considered (for instance, when the qubit measurements are in
the upper hemisphere of the Bloch ball), outcome communication does offer an
advantage. This exemplifies that trivial properties in standard LHV scenarios,
such as deterministic measurements and outcome-relabelling, play a crucial role
in the outcome communication scenario.

Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising

Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate

TL;DR: The paper explores noise in quantum computers, noting that current models often overlook non-Markovian effects like qubit coupling and bath correlations. They used the PMME to study these effects and experimentally validated it, showing that crosstalk is a big factor in observed noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing relies heavily on understanding qubit noise; this work addresses a gap in current noise modeling techniques.

Method: Used the Post-Markovian Master Equation formalism and tested it with IBM Quantum superconducting qubits.

Result: Observed non-Markovian behavior in quantum circuits and found crosstalk to be a dominant factor.

Conclusion: Current quantum hardware's noise is significantly affected by crosstalk, and PMME better captures this behavior compared to Markovian models.

Abstract: Understanding the noise characteristics of quantum processors is crucial when
achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, typical qubit designs are
often studied under the Markovian approximation, which does not fully capture
realistic dynamics. Factors such as qubit-qubit coupling and extended bath
correlation times can introduce significant non-Markovian effects into the
noise processes. In this study, we employ the Post-Markovian Master Equation
(PMME) formalism to characterize memory effects in the noise dynamics. We
further experimentally validate the PMME framework using superconducting qubits
on an IBM Quantum device, demonstrating clear non-Markovian behavior during
circuit execution. Additionally, we quantify the crosstalk effect using an
information-theoretic approach and reveal that crosstalk can dominate the
observed non-Markovian effects in current quantum hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential loss in optical fiber-based QKD networks necessitates satellite-assisted solutions for scalable, long-distance secure communication.

Method: A satellite-based QKD setup was developed in the Iberian Peninsula, utilizing a LEO satellite with an SPDC source. The setup links Madrid with Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lisbon. Optimizations were made to enhance transmission probabilities by adjusting the satellite's beam waist to account for vibrations.

Result: The study demonstrated that satellite-assisted QKD can achieve key rates suitable for real-world applications, such as secure hospital communication, using existing hybrid classical-quantum protocols.

Conclusion: Satellite-based QKD is a viable near-term solution for national-scale secure communications, overcoming the limitations of optical fiber-based systems through scalable and optimized satellite-based setups.

Abstract: A promising use of quantum networking is quantum key distribution (QKD),
which can provide information-theoretic security unattainable by classical
means. While optical fiber-based QKD networks suffer from exponential loss,
satellite-assisted quantum communication offers a scalable solution for
long-distance secure key exchange. In this work, we propose and evaluate a
satellite-based QKD setup covering the Iberian Peninsula, linking Madrid with
Barcelona, Bilbao, and Lisbon. Our proposed setup uses a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO)
state-of-the-art satellite equipped with a spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) source to distribute entangled photon pairs to ground
stations. Considering vibrations in the satellite, we optimize the beam waist
to enhance the transmission probability and improve the secret key rate (SKR).
Our results show that key rates sufficient for real-world applications, such as
secure communication between hospitals, using hybrid classical-quantum
protocols are feasible with existing protocols. Our results highlight the
viability of near-term satellite-based QKD networks for national-scale secure
communications.

Abstract: We introduce a simulation-free method to estimate the fidelity of large
quantum circuits based on the order statistics of measured output probabilities
from highly entangled, chaotic states. The approach requires only the
highest-probability output bitstrings -- the most frequently observed
measurement outcomes -- and builds on exact analytical results for the order
statistics of Haar-random quantum states derived here. Analyzing their
modification under depolarizing noise, we propose a scalable fidelity
estimator, validated on Google's 12-qubit Sycamore experiment and further
supported by numerical simulations. We demonstrate its practicality for
intermediate-scale quantum circuits, where cross-entropy benchmarking is costly
and direct fidelity estimation is difficult.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Constructing a quantum computer capable of broad and important applications
is likely to require millions of addressable physical qubits, posing the
challenge of large-scale integration of quantum systems with classical
electronics. Fully depleted silicon-on-insulator CMOS technology has been used
to develop a range of cryogenic electronic components for the control and
readout of different qubit modalities interfaced on separate chips. However,
recent measurements of quantum dots on this technology raise the tantalising
prospect of realising control electronics and spin qubits on the same
manufacturing platform, within a single integrated circuit (IC). Here, we
demonstrate single-shot spin readout in addressable quantum dot devices within
an IC fabricated using industry-standard 22 nm fully depleted
silicon-on-insulator technology. We achieve spin-to-charge conversion via a
ramped energy-selective measurement, detected using a radio-frequency
single-electron transistor and addressed by on-chip cryogenic electronics. The
observation of consistent readout visibilities exceeding 90% and millisecond

*Varun Srivastava,Abhinash Kumar Roy,Soumik Mahanti,Jasleen Kaur,Salini Karuvade,Alexei Gilchrist*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Derives analytic expressions for avg sequence fidelity (ASF) in presence of temporally correlated (non-Markovian) noise with classical memory. Introduces methods to extract benchmarking parameters under such noise and identifies when such correlations are invisible to RB. Also provides criteria to witness temp correlations via RB and shows that classical correlations can affect worst-case errors quantified by diamond norm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum hardware benchmarking is crucial for verifying the performance of quantum devices. Traditional randomized benchmarking (RB) assumes uncorrelated noise, which is often not true for current hardware. Understanding the role of temporally correlated noise in RB is essential for accurate error characterization and mitigation.

Method: Derives analytical expressions for ASF under temporally correlated noise, considering both classical and quantum memory effects. Proposes criteria for detecting these correlations through RB experiments and evaluates the impact on diamond norm errors.

Result: The derived expressions enable the extraction of benchmarking parameters even when noise is correlated. The analysis identifies specific classes of noise models where such correlations are invisible to RB and demonstrates that these correlations can have both positive and negative impacts on diamond norm errors, depending on the specific noise scenario.

Conclusion: This work extend the capabilities of RB to account for realistic noise correlations, providing new tools for quantum hardware characterization. The findings highlight that while classical correlations can affect diamond norm errors, they may not always have detrimental effects, which is important for fault-tolerant quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Randomized benchmarking (RB) is a widely adopted protocol for estimating the
average gate fidelity in quantum hardware. However, its standard formulation
relies on the assumption of temporally uncorrelated noise, an assumption often
violated in current devices. In this work, we derive analytic expressions for
the average sequence fidelity (ASF) in the presence of temporally correlated
(non-Markovian) noise with classical memory, including cases where such
correlations originate from interactions with a quantum environment. We show
how the ASF can be interpreted to extract meaningful benchmarking parameters
under such noise and identify classes of interaction Hamiltonians that render
temporal correlations completely invisible to RB. We further provide
operational criteria for witnessing temporal correlations due to quantum memory
through RB experiments. Importantly, while classical correlations may remain
undetectable in the ASF data, they can nonetheless significantly affect
worst-case errors quantified by the diamond norm, a metric central to fault
tolerant quantum computing. In particular, we demonstrate that temporal
correlations may suppress worst-case errors highlighting that temporal
correlations may not always have detrimental effects on gate performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems typically evolve toward an
infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption. Before
reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived
prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete
time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of
periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the
IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate
interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits
with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced
DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla
qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling
oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed
into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in
systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly
stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On
the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on
53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively.
In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling
oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome
and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed.
These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state
simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the
two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in
ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases,
including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs.

*Margarida Pereira,Guillermo Currás-Lorenzo,Mateus Araújo*

TL;DR: This paper explores conic-optimization methods for quantum key distribution protocols with incomplete state characterization, showing improved performance under realistic source imperfections, especially for non-qubit encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols rely on rigorous security proofs, which are often computationally intensive. This paper aims to enhance numerical security proofs by addressing realistic source imperfections, making the framework more practical for implementation.

Method: The authors extend conic-optimization methods to scenarios where only partial information about the emitted states is known, focusing on both prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent (MDI) protocols. Their method accounts for source imperfections and non-qubit encodings, providing a more robust framework for numerical security evaluations.

Result: The results demonstrate that their conic-optimization-based approach outperforms existing analytical and numerical methods in realistic source imperfection scenarios, particularly for protocols using non-qubit encodings. This advancement paves the way for a standard numerical-based proof framework for evaluating QKD protocols with source imperfections.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the development of practical and scalable numerical verification methods for QKD protocols by considering partial state information and real-world source imperfections, thus enhancing their reliability and applicability in implementation.

Abstract: Numerical security proofs based on conic optimization are known to deliver
optimal secret-key rates, but so far they have mostly assumed that the emitted
states are fully characterized. In practice, this assumption is unrealistic,
since real devices inevitably suffer from imperfections and side channels that
are extremely difficult to model in detail. Here, we extend conic-optimization
methods to scenarios where only partial information about the emitted states is
known, covering both prepare-and-measure and measurement-device-independent
protocols. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
analytical and numerical approaches under realistic source imperfections,
especially for protocols that use non-qubit encodings. These results advance
numerical-based proofs towards a standard, implementation-ready framework for
evaluating quantum key distribution protocols in the presence of source
imperfections.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for quantum criticality in
the non-Hermitian detuned PXP model, and establish the complete phase diagram,
which had remained elusive in previous studies. Starting from a numerically
identified phase transition point, we construct an exact second-order phase
transition boundary through a similarity transformation in the real-energy
regime. By introducing the biorthogonal entanglement entropy and biorthogonal
Loschmidt echo, we demonstrate from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium
perspectives that this transition belongs to the Ising universality class.
Using the correlation function, we further distinguish between confined and
deconfined phases within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric region. In the
complex-energy regime, we identify both a full $\mathcal{PT}$ transition and a
first-excited-state $\mathcal{PT}$ transition, respectively. Moreover, we
identify the location of the Yang-Lee edge singularity (YLES) using both the
associated-biorthogonal and self-normal Loschmidt echoes, and extract the
corresponding critical exponent, which agrees with the predictions of
non-unitary conformal field theory. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme
to observe the YLES in Rydberg atomic arrays, which offers a promising route to
exploring non-Hermitian critical phenomena and singularities in future
experimental settings.

Abstract: Simultaneous quantum-classical communication (SQCC) protocols offer a
practical approach to continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) by
encoding quantum and classical signals onto the same optical pulse. However,
like most QKD protocols, their performance is limited when experimental
parameters, such as modulation variance, are optimised based on stationary
channel assumptions. In fluctuating environments, such as free-space links,
this can result in sub-optimal key rates and reduced transmission distances. In
this work, we introduce Gaussian post-selection into the SQCC framework,
enabling a software-based optimisation of the modulation variance after channel
estimation. This passive approach enhances key rates in both asymptotic and
finite-size regimes without requiring hardware modifications and remains
effective even when receiver imperfections are taken into account. We
demonstrate that our protocol significantly improves the transmission distance
and robustness of SQCC across both fibre and free-space channels. In
particular, we show that the protocol enables full communication windows under
ideal weather conditions and maintains higher duty cycles during adverse
weather in satellite-to-ground scenarios. These results highlight the
practicality of post-selection based SQCC for real-world quantum communication
over both terrestrial fiber networks and satellite-based free-space links.

Abstract: We investigate certain quantumness in the vicinity of the Schwarzschild black

on the l_1-norm of quantum coherence, the first-order coherence (FOC), the
concurrence-fill (CF) and the global concurrence (GC) in Schwarzschild black
hole, for systems with one, two and three physically accessible modes. We
conclude that the Hawking effect of the black hole not only disrupts but also
enhance the quantum entanglement, while destroying the quantum coherence for
systems with three physically accessible modes. For systems with one or two
physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect exerts a positive influence on
quantum coherence and quantum entanglement. Moreover, we study the influence of
both the Hawking effect and environmental noise (AD channels) on l_1-norm of
quantum coherence, FOC, CF and GC. It is demonstrated that for systems with
three physically accessible modes, the Hawking effect of the black hole
disrupts quantum coherence but exerts a positive influence on quantum

Abstract: The supersymmetric structure of a generalized non-Hermitian driven two-level
system is demonstrated. A unitary rotation turns the Hamiltonian into a more
convenient form. After decoupling a set of differential equations, the
supersymmetric structure of the problem can be unequivocally ap- appreciated.
Performing a spectral analysis of an auxiliary stationary Schr\"odinger-like
equation, complex time-dependent driving functions are obtained for which the
corresponding (time-dependent) Schr\"odinger equation can be straightforwardly
solved. Such complex drivings are seen to produce transitions in the qubit
state in different, however interesting, manners. We believe that the results
reported here will be of interest for designing and carrying out various
experiments in laboratories specializing in nuclear magnetic resonance or in

Motivation: Exploring nonlinear spin dynamics can lead to practical applications such as spin masers, time crystals, and magnetometers, making this research important for both fundamental physics and technology.

Method: They used dual-bias magnetic fields and dual-cell alkali-metal atomic gases, varying feedback and magnetic fields to observe dynamical behaviors. Analysis likely involved numerical simulations and experimental observations.

Result: Three stable dynamical behaviors: limit cycles, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaos. Phase transitions between these dynamics were observed by adjusting feedback gain and magnetic bias differences. The system's robustness against field noise was confirmed.

Conclusion: This study offers a versatile platform for complex spin dynamics and applications in advanced technologies, opening new possibilities for future research and innovations.

Abstract: Nonlinear spin systems exhibit rich and exotic dynamical phenomena, offering
promising applications ranging from spin masers and time crystals to precision
measurement. Recent theoretical work [T. Wang et al., Commun. Phys. 8, 41
(2025)] predicted intriguing nonlinear dynamical phases arising from
inhomogeneous magnetic fields and feedback interactions. However, experimental
exploration of these predictions remains lacking. Here, we report the
observation of nonlinear spin dynamics in dual-bias magnetic fields with
dual-cell alkali-metal atomic gases and present three representative stable
dynamical behaviors of limit cycles, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaos.
Additionally, we probe the nonlinear phase transitions between these phases by
varying the feedback gain and the difference of dual-bias magnetic fields.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the limit cycle and
quasi-periodic orbit against the noise of magnetic fields. Our findings
establish a versatile platform for exploring complex spin dynamics and open new
avenues for the realization of multimode spin masers, time crystals and
quasi-crystals, and high-precision magnetometers.

Abstract: Demonstration of quantum advantage for classical machine learning tasks

Two major bottlenecks to this goal are the high dimensionality of practical

is among the few models with experimentally verified quantum advantage, yet it
lacks practical applications. Here, we develop a hybrid framework that combines
the computational power of boson sampling with the adaptability of neural
networks to construct quantum kernels that enhance support vector machine
classification. The neural network adaptively compresses the data features onto
a programmable boson sampling circuit, producing quantum states that span a
high-dimensional Hilbert space and enable improved classification performance.
Using four datasets with various classes, we demonstrate that our model
outperforms classical linear and sigmoid kernels. These results highlight the

Abstract: Implementation of a two-level non-Hermitian qubit via postselection of a
three-level system has been demonstrated. The postselection procedure, which
discards quantum jump to the ground-state manifold while retaining excitations
in the first and second excited-state manifolds, effectively generates a
non-Hermitian qubit exhibiting PT symmetry. In this work, we perform continuous
homodyne mea- surement of this non-Hermitian qubit and analyze the interplay
between decay introduced by posts- election and measurement backaction. We
compare the ensemble-averaged dynamics obtained from measurement trajectories
with the the Liouvillian average. We formulate the no-jump stochastic
differential equation describing the postselected non-Hermitian qubit and show
that its ensemble- averaged dynamics agree with those of the jump-updated
postselected evolution at drive strengths far from the Liouvillian exceptional
point (EP). The degree of deviation near the EP depends sensitively on the
nature of the drive. This discrepancy is attributed to the interplay between
measurement backaction and the non-Hermitian decay introduced by postselection.
Furthermore, we determine the optimal path of the non-Hermitian qubit by
extremizing the action within the path-integral formulation of the quantum
trajectory framework Our results provide insights into how measurement
backaction and non-Hermitian dynamics together shape the transient behavior of
open quantum systems and enable controlled manipulation of qubits near
exceptional points.

Abstract: In the massive multiple-input and multiple-output (Massive MIMO) systems, the

devices, can show quantum advantage for approximately solving combinatorial
optimization problems. In this paper, we propose the QAOA based the maximum
likelihood detection solver of binary symbols. In proposed scheme, we first
conduct a universal and compact analytical expression for the expectation value
of the 1-level QAOA. Second, a bayesian optimization based parameters
initialization is presented, which can speedup the convergence of the QAOA to a
lower local minimum and improve the probability of measuring the exact
solution. Compared to the state-of-the-art QAOA based ML detection algorithm,
our scheme have the more universal and compact expectation value expression of
the 1-level QAOA, and requires few quantum resources and has the higher
probability to obtain the exact solution.

parameters, where $\text{Y}$ and $\bar{\text{Y}}$ refer to the spin-$1/2$
hyperon and its antihyperon, respectively. Without a dephasing effect, we show
that, LN, LQU, and LQFI vanish at $\varphi=\pm\pi$ and are symmetric around
$\varphi=\pi/2$. We also explore the LN, LQU, and LQFI for different
$\text{Y}\bar{\text{Y}}$ pairs subjected to three distinct types of decoherence
channels. Specifically, we show that amplitude damping (AD) and phase damping
(PD) lead to a decrease in LN, LQU, and LQFI with an increasing decoherence
parameter $s$. In contrast, the phase flip (PF) channel exhibits symmetric
behavior around $s=1/2$. Besides, we realize for teleportation, optimal
fidelity for different hyperon-antihyperon pairs ($ \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$,
$\Xi^{0}\bar{\Xi^{0}}$, $\Xi^{-}\bar{\Xi^{+}}$, $\Sigma^{+}\bar{\Sigma^{-}}$).
We discuss the influence of noisy channels, specifically (AD, PF and PD), on
the fidelity of quantum teleportation and on quantum correlations that can
exist even beyond entanglement. Furthermore, the results show that the fidelity
remains above the classical limit of $2/3$ in all three channels, even as the
noise increases. This is a significant finding because it shows that not all
quantum noise is detrimental. These results can have promising applications in
quantum information and particle physics.

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum-classical reservoir computing shows significant quantum advantage against adversarial attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancing hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models for enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks is crucial for practical applications. This study aims to evaluate a quantum reservoir computing model augmented with a multilayer perceptron, focusing on its resilience against white-box adversarial attacks.

Method: The research employs a quantum reservoir composed of Rydberg atoms governed by a fixed Hamiltonian, combined with a lightweight multilayer perceptron as the readout layer. The model is tested using balanced datasets: MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST under various adversarial perturbations.

Result: The hybrid model demonstrates significantly higher accuracy than purely classical models across different perturbation strengths, showcasing the potential of quantum reservoir computing in enhancing adversarial robustness.

Conclusion: This work represents the first systematic evaluation of adversarial robustness in a quantum reservoir computing model, highlighting its effectiveness in mitigating adversarial attacks and emphasizing the importance of integrating quantum and classical components for quantum machine learning applications.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) leverages the high-dimensional, nonlinear
dynamics inherent in quantum many-body systems for extracting spatiotemporal
patterns in sequential and time-series data with minimal training overhead.
Although QRC inherits the expressive capabilities associated with quantum
encodings, recent studies indicate that quantum classifiers based on
variational circuits remain susceptible to adversarial perturbations. In this
perspective, we investigate the first systematic evaluation of adversarial
robustness in a QRC based learning model. Our reservoir comprises an array of
strongly interacting Rydberg atoms governed by a fixed Hamiltonian, which
naturally evolves under complex quantum dynamics, producing high-dimensional
embeddings. A lightweight multilayer perceptron serves as the trainable readout
layer. We utilize the balanced datasets, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and
Kuzushiji-MNIST, as a benchmark for rigorously evaluating the impact of
augmenting the quantum reservoir with a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) in
white-box adversarial attacks to assess its robustness. We demonstrate that
this approach yields significantly higher accuracy than purely classical models
across all perturbation strengths tested. This hybrid approach reveals a new

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A quantum thermal diode, similar to an electronic diode, allows for
unidirectional heat transmission. In this paper, we study a quantum thermal
diode composed of two two-level atoms coupled to auxiliary two-level atoms. We
find that the excited auxiliary atoms can weaken heat current and enhance the
rectification effect, but the ground-state auxiliary atoms can enhance heat
current and weaken the rectification effect. The more auxiliary atoms are
coupled, the stronger the enhancing or weakening impact is. If the auxiliary
atom is in a superposition state, we find that only the fraction that projects
onto the excited state plays a significant role. In particular, if we properly
design the coupling of the auxiliary atoms, the rectification effect can be
eliminated. This provides the potential to control the heat current and the
rectification performance by the states of the auxiliary atoms.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A modular architecture for quantum computers that uses surface codes and lattice surgery offers an efficient way to implement fault-tolerant quantum computing by confining noise to processor interfaces while using only half the number of non-local gates as previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create a more scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture by dividing quantum processors into smaller modules connected by relatively noisy links.

Method: The method involves introducing a protocol for lattice surgery on surface codes that uses only Bell measurements as non-local operations. To mitigate the effects of noise, the protocol also includes a strategy of alternating the gate sequence with syndrome measurements to prevent logical operator formation.

Result: The protocol demonstrates improved performance, requiring 40% less entanglement resources for a given logical error rate compared to existing protocols, making it more resource-efficient.

Conclusion: This modular quantum computing design provides a scalable and efficient approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing by optimizing resource usage while maintaining high fidelity.

Abstract: Modular architectures are a promising approach to scaling quantum computers
to fault tolerance. Small, low-noise quantum processors connected through
relatively noisy quantum links are capable of fault-tolerant operation as long
as the noise can be confined to the interface. Finding protocols that implement
the quantum links between modules as efficiently as possible is essential
because inter-module entanglement is challenging to produce at a similar rate
and fidelity as local entanglement. We introduce a protocol for lattice surgery
on surface codes in which all non-local operations are Bell measurements. The
protocol simultaneously confines the link noise and requires only half as many
module-crossing gates as previously proposed protocols. To mitigate
distance-reducing hook errors, we introduce a strategy of alternating the gate
sequence between rounds of syndrome measurement, which prevents multiple hooks
from simultaneously aligning with a logical operator in the code. We evaluate
our protocol's performance when two logical qubits on separate modules are
prepared in a logical Bell state. Circuit-level simulations under depolarizing
noise show that the logical error suppression for a given entanglement rate
between modules is consistently stronger compared to the best-performing
alternative protocols for a wide range of link noise, with a typical 40%
entanglement resource saving for a constant logical error rate. Our approach to
protocol design is applicable to any quantum circuit that must be divided
across processor modules and can therefore guide development of
resource-efficient modular quantum computation beyond the surface code.

Abstract: We propose a state-specific orbital optimization scheme for improving the

optimize the orbitals. This scheme allows for more flexibility in the choice of

Conclusion: 该框架NCF在减少Hamiltonian模拟中的T门计数和T门深度方面表现出色，为量子计算中的资源优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a key quantum algorithm for modeling complex
systems. To implement a Hamiltonian simulation, it is typically decomposed into
a list of Pauli strings, each corresponds to an RZ rotation gate with many
Clifford gates. These RZ gates are generally synthesized into a sequence of
Clifford and T gates in fault-tolerant quantum computers, where the T-gate
count and T-gate depth are critical metrics for such systems. In this paper, we
propose NCF, a compilation framework that reduces both the T-gate count and
T-gate depth for Hamiltonian simulation. NCF partitions Pauli strings into
groups, where each group can be conjugated (i.e., transformed) into a list of
Pauli strings that apply quantum gates on a restricted subset of qubits,
allowing for simultaneous synthesis of the whole group and reducing both T-gate
count and depth. Experimental results demonstrate that NCF achieves an average
reduction of 57.4%, 49.1%, and 49.0% in T-gate count, T-gate depth, and
Clifford count, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new class of Hamiltonians, called the dome model, designed for robust quantum information processing through noise-assisted inverse engineering. It shows that this model improves system robustness and scalability, making it suitable for superconducting qubits with tunable couplers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust and scalable quantum systems are essential for practical quantum information processing, particularly in the face of noise. This paper presents a novel approach to achieve these goals through advanced Hamiltonian design.

Method: The authors employ noise-assisted inverse engineering to construct the dome model Hamiltonians. They use numerical simulations to validate the model's effectiveness and propose a cascaded strategy for scalability.

Result: The dome model demonstrates improved robustness against noise and scalability for long-distance quantum state transfer. It simplifies to known models at specific parameter values, enhancing both experimental feasibility and theoretical understanding.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in designing robust and scalable quantum Hamiltonians, paving the way for practical implementations in next-generation quantum technologies.

Abstract: Hamiltonian inverse engineering enables the design of protocols for specific
quantum evolutions or target state preparation. Perfect state transfer (PST)
and remote entanglement generation are notable examples, as they serve as key
primitives in quantum information processing. However, Hamiltonians obtained
through conventional methods often lack robustness against noise. Assisted by
inverse engineering, we begin with a noise-resilient energy spectrum and
construct a class of Hamiltonians, referred to as the dome model, that
significantly improves the system's robustness against noise, as confirmed by
numerical simulations. This model introduces a tunable parameter $m$ that
modifies the energy-level spacing and gives rise to a well-structured
Hamiltonian. It reduces to the conventional PST model at $m=0$ and simplifies
to a SWAP model involving only two end qubits in the large-$m$ regime. To
address the challenge of scalability, we propose a cascaded strategy that
divides long-distance PST into multiple consecutive PST steps. Our work is
particularly suited for demonstration on superconducting qubits with tunable
couplers, which enable rapid and flexible Hamiltonian engineering, thereby
advancing the experimental potential of robust and scalable quantum information
processing.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A comprehensive statistical framework for assessing single-qubit quantum teleportation performance beyond conventional average-fidelity benchmarks. The framework derives a closed-form expression for teleportation fidelity under two noise models, reveals that identical average fidelities can exhibit different statistical behaviors, and introduces a certification method based on prior importance functions. The study shows that higher fidelity teleportation requires stronger entanglement or non-locality, and the 'fighting noise with noise' effect is due to the choice of prior importance function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum teleportation is a crucial quantum information processing task, and its performance assessment is essential for optimizing resource usage and minimizing errors.

Method: Mathematical derivation of the probability density function for teleportation fidelities under various noise models. Bayesian analysis with prior importance functions for certification.

Result: Protocols with the same average fidelity can exhibit distinct statistical behaviors. The 'fighting noise with noise' effect is primarily due to the selection of prior importance functions, not inherent quantum advantage.

Conclusion: This framework provides a more nuanced approach to evaluating quantum teleportation by considering statistical variations beyond average fidelity, enabling better application-specific benchmarks and optimizations.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a comprehensive statistical framework for
assessing single-qubit quantum teleportation performance beyond the
conventional average-fidelity benchmark. At first, we derive a closed-form
expression for the full probability density function of actual teleportation
fidelities and apply it to both classical measure-and-prepare schemes and
standard quantum teleportation, considering two relevant noise models:
Bell-diagonal resource states and local amplitude-damping channels. These
results reveal that protocols with identical average fidelities can exhibit
markedly different statistical behaviors, and that relying solely on average
fidelity can mask inherent asymmetries introduced by local noise, potentially
leading to spurious conclusions of symmetry. Secondly, we introduce a
certification method based on prior importance functions (e.g., Beta
distributions), which unifies moment-based criteria and threshold-based success
probabilities into a single figure of merit. Applying this framework, we show
that certifying high-fidelity teleportation requires increasingly stronger
entanglement or non-locality, and we clarify that the so-called ``fighting
noise with noise'' effect arises from the chosen prior importance function
rather than representing a genuine advantage. Our approach thus provides
versatile tools for tailored, application-specific teleportation benchmarks.

Abstract: The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the
last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by
different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At
the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak
or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical
difference corresponds to a fundamental physical question: whether the global
charge associated to the symmetry group is accessible to symmetry-constrained
observers. In this context, we formulate a definition of a perspective in terms
of operational capacities, or lack thereof. Turning to consequences of adopting
either approach, we discuss how adopting the weak approach induces an ambiguity
in the momenta included in each perspective and bars from defining reversible
QRF transformations. We then review and analyze the existing arguments
motivating each approach, and show how they bear upon the problem of charge
accessibility. Finally, we introduce a simple operational scenario in which
upholding two reasonable physical postulates leads to the conclusion that
internal observers could measure the global charge by 1/ performing a
relativized interference measurement and 2/ classically communicating.

The findings suggest that cryogenic-compatible antennas can enable practical wireless communication within quantum computers, supporting future advancements in quantum computing infrastructure.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of
the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core
quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling
scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected
via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections
persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across
temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial
constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as
the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes
a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to
enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat.
Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately
capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a
realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation
within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection
coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat,
demonstrating efficient impedance matching.

Abstract: Randomized quantum algorithms have been proposed in the context of quantum
simulation and quantum linear algebra with the goal of constructing shallower
circuits than methods based on block encodings. While the algorithmic
complexities of such randomized schemes have been shown to be suboptimal, it
has been speculated that they may offer benefits in the early fault-tolerant
era where circuit depth comes at a premium. In this work, we investigate the
end-to-end resource requirements for a randomized quantum linear systems solver
to estimate scalar properties of the matrix inverse by combining sampling from
a Fourier series with Hamiltonian simulation. We derive explicit bounds on all
relevant algorithmic parameters that control the total error. We analyze two
algorithmic kernels for Hamiltonian simulation: a second order product formula
approximation and a method called random Taylor expansion (RTE).
  Finally, we provide numerical demonstrations that confirm the validity of our
analytical results and question the actual practicality of the randomized
Fourier series-based approach for linear systems problems as we show that the
sampling complexity can grow exponentially. By providing explicit bounds, our
work serves as a bridge between theoretical algorithmic proposals and efficient
hardware implementations while also enabling fair comparisons to alternative
algorithms that exhibit optimal asymptotic complexities at the cost of large
resource overheads.

Result: Method shows promise in high-dimensional real-world datasets (molecular toxicity, image recognition). Quantum-extracted features are found to complement classical ones, improving performance.

Conclusion: Combining quantum and classical feature extraction shows early promise for near-term quantum devices in data-driven applications.

Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian-based quantum feature extraction method that
generates complex features via the dynamics of $k$-local many-body spins
Hamiltonians, enhancing machine learning performance. Classical feature vectors
are embedded into spin-glass Hamiltonians, where both single-variable
contributions and higher-order correlations are represented through many-body
interactions. By evolving the system under suitable quantum dynamics on IBM
digital quantum processors with 156 qubits, the data are mapped into a
higher-dimensional feature space via expectation values of low- and
higher-order observables. This allows us to capture statistical dependencies
that are difficult to access with standard classical methods. We assess the
approach on high-dimensional, real-world datasets, including molecular toxicity
classification and image recognition, and analyze feature importance to show
that quantum-extracted features complement and, in many cases, surpass
classical ones. The results suggest that combining quantum and classical
feature extraction can provide consistent improvements across diverse machine
learning tasks, indicating a reliable level of early quantum usefulness for
near-term quantum devices in data-driven applications.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires
separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and
$\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers
only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic
bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present
bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology
that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with
process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\eta_2$
and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals.
The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact
observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector
noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization.
Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to
ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these
efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields
distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas
conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially
misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and
platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip
coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible,
coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics,
frequency conversion, and precision metrology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Controlling photon mediated energy flow is central to the future of
communications, thermal management, and energy harvesting technologies. Recent
breakthroughs have revealed that many body systems violating Lorentz
reciprocity can sustain persistent photon heat current at thermal equilibrium,
hinting at a new paradigm of heat flow akin to superconductivity. Yet, the
behavior of such systems far from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. In
this work, we uncover the rich physics of radiative heat transfer in
nonequilibrium, far field many body systems composed of thermal emitters that
break Lorentz reciprocity. We show that the total heat flow naturally
decomposes into two distinct components: an equilibrium term, which generates a
persistent circulating heat current within the system, and a nonequilibrium
term, which governs energy exchange with the environment. Remarkably, while the
internal persistent heat current is ever present, the nonequilibrium
contribution can be precisely engineered to achieve perfect heat rectification
and circulation. Our results open a new route toward designing thermal systems
with unprecedented control unlocking the potential for lossless heat
circulation and one way thermal devices. This fundamentally shifts the
landscape for next generation thermal logic, energy conversion, and photonic
heat engines.

Abstract: Optical manipulation techniques offer exceptional contactless control but are
fundamentally limited in their ability to perform parallel multitasking. To
achieve high-density, versatile manipulation with subwavelength photonic
devices, it is essential to sculpt light fields in multiple dimensions. Here,
we overcome this challenge by introducing generalized optical meta-spanners
(GOMSs) based on metasurfaces. Relying on complex-amplitude modulation, this
platform generates lens-free, customizable optical fields that suppress
diffractive losses. As a result, several advanced functionalities are
simultaneously achieved, including longitudinally varying manipulation and
in-plane spanner arrays, which outperforms the same operations realized by
conventional donut-shaped orbital flows. Furthermore, the particle dynamics is
reconfigurable simply by switching the input and output polarizations,
facilitating robust multi-channel control. We experimentally validate the
proposed approach by demonstrating single-particle dynamics and the parallel
manipulation of particle ensembles, revealing exceptional stability for
multitasking operations. These results demonstrate an ultracompact platform
scalable to a much larger number of optical spanners, advancing metadevices
from wavefront sculptors to particle manipulators. We envision that the GOMS
will catalyze innovations in cross-disciplinary fields such as targeted drug
delivery and cell-level biomechanics.

Abstract: The maximum baseline, and therefore resolution, of optical astronomical
interferometers is limited by attenuation and phase noise within the optical
path between the apertures and beam combiner, as well as the practical
challenges of constructing optical delay lines more than a few hundred meters
in length. We implement off-band phase stabilization on two fiber optic links
of 85 km, creating a total baseline of 170 km. We show that the system is able
to effectively phase stabilize signals from an incoherent pseudo-thermal source
with a bandwidth of 11.2 nm. We are able to reduce the phase noise of a fiber
based interferometer with two 85 km arms by 4-5 orders of magnitude between 1
and 100 Hz such that we could resolve an applied phase shift sweep of 0.16
cycles per second with continuous measurement. We show that, with phase
stabilization active, the interferometer is able to recover both first-order
and second-order photon correlations. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of this technique for long-baseline optical and quantum astronomical
interferometers. The present results are limited by chromatic dispersion within
the fiber, which can be mitigated using dispersion compensating modules.

Abstract: Generative models such as AlphaFold and MatterGen can directly generate novel
material structures with desired properties, accelerating the new materials
discovery and revolutionizing the material design paradigm from traditional
trial-and-error approach to intelligent on-demand generation. AlphaFold is
focused on protein prediction with specific aperiodic structures; while
MatterGen is focused on predicting periodic and stable crystal structures. The
universal design of metamaterials is much more complicated, since it involves
to design meta-atoms (similar to the periodic structures) and their arbitrarily
inhomogeneous distributions in space. Here, we propose InfoMetaGen, a universal
generative model for information metamaterial design, which combines a
pre-trained foundation model with lightweight functional adapters to
intelligently generate artificial structures on-demand spanning from meta-atoms
to arbitrary space coding patterns. In contrast to conventional intelligent
metamaterial design methods that require training dedicated models for specific
functionalities, InfoMetaGen enables a single universal generative model
capable of switching across diverse functionalities by fine-tuning the
lightweight adapters, significantly improving both efficiency and
generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that InfoMetaGen can not
only accelerate the diverse discovery of new metamaterials, but also achieve
breakthroughs in metamaterial performance. This work fills the gap of universal
generative framework in designing artificial materials, and opens up
unprecedented opportunities to expand the capability of generative models from
the passive discovery of microscopic natural material to the active creation of
macroscopic artificial materials.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Organic semiconductors are particularly attractive for polaritonics due to
their large exciton binding energies and oscillator strengths. Among them, the
ladder-type conjugated polymer poly(paraphenylene) (MeLPPP) is distinguished by
its rigid backbone, narrow exciton linewidth, high photoluminescence quantum
yield, and enhanced photostability, which makes it an excellent candidate for
organic polariton devices. While polariton lasing has been reported in various
organic systems, systematic studies of the transition from polariton lasing to
conventional photon lasing within a single, well-controlled material platform
remain limited. Understanding this crossover is crucial for distinguishing
polariton-specific signatures from conventional lasing. Here, we present planar
organic microcavities incorporating MeLPPP as the active medium that supports
polariton lasing. By tuning the effective cavity length, we track the
transition from strong to weak coupling and identify its impact on the lasing
behaviour. Our results reveal a many fold increase in the lasing threshold when
moving from polariton to photon lasing, emission energy pulling towards the
polymer gain maximum for either regimes, and an important role of vibron
mediated exciton relaxation evidenced by the reduction in lasing thresholds
near vibron energy resonances with respect to the S10 exciton. These findings
provide fundamental insight into light-matter coupling in organics and
highlight MeLPPP microcavities as a versatile platform for future applications
in low-threshold lasers.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的等化光探测器设计，有效解决了传统 Germanium (Ge) 光探测器在带宽和 dark current 方面的局限性，为下一代光通信系统提供了高性能的光探测解决方案。

Abstract: High bandwidth and low dark current germanium (Ge) photodetectors are crucial
in silicon photonic integrated circuits. The bandwidth of Ge photodetectors is
restricted by carrier transit time and parasitic parameters. And thermal
generation of carriers within the Ge P-N junction results in an inherent dark
current, typically in nA-{\mu}A range. Here, we propose an equalization
photodetector (EqPD) utilizing the frequency response of a high-bandwidth
photodetector PDA to subtract the frequency response of a low-bandwidth
photodetector PDB. With the response of PDB attenuating more severely than PDA
at high frequency, the differential response (the response of EqPD) can get
higher values at high-frequency than at low-frequency. The dark current of EqPD
can also be significantly reduced with PDB balancing the dark current of PDA.
Experimental results show that the bandwidth of our proposed photodetector can
be expanded to over 110 GHz with a dark current of 1 pA simultaneously, and its
Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) transmission speed can reach 100 Gbaud without digital
signal processing. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest
bandwidth and lowest dark current in a vertical Ge photodetector. The
high-performance EqPD provides a promising solution for high-speed and
ultra-low noise photodetection in next-generation optical communication.

Abstract: This study introduces a Holographic Agglutination Assay for quantifying
levels of the immunoglobulin protein IgA in biological samples. This is the
first example of a label-free and bead-free assay that quantifies protein
agglutinates by direct detection using Total Holographic Characterization. A
proof-of-concept assay for human serum immunoglobulins is demonstrated using
Jacalin, the galactose-specific plant lectin, to induce selective
agglutination.
  By analyzing the size, refractive index, and number of particles in an assay
sample, we obtain a reproducible and quantitative measurement of galactosylated
immunoglobulins in a given sample. The assay is calibrated for a
physiologically relevant reference interval of IgA concentrations in a 10x
diluted emulated biological sample from low (80 mg/dL, 5 {\mu}M) to high (320
mg/dL, 20 {\mu}M) levels. The assay clearly distinguishes samples containing
IgA from samples containing IgG.
  More broadly, this study introduces a platform for creating lectin-mediated
Holographic Agglutination Assays to monitor levels of immunoglobulins in
biological samples. The ability to quantify immunoglobulin levels efficiently
in clinical samples is likely to be valuable for diagnostics and will provide a
basis for assaying other proteins that can be induced to agglutinate.

Abstract: Dirac vortices, originally studied in quantum field theories to predict
localized zero-energy modes, were recently realized in photonics, leading to
Dirac vortex cavities. With topological protection, Dirac vortex cavities offer
robust single-mode large-area localized modes appealing for high-performance
micro-lasers and other applications. As a spectrally-isolated single mode, the
radiation of a Dirac vortex cavity mode was believed as having vanishing
orbital angular momentum due to time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the
direct observation of orbital angular momentum radiation of a Dirac vortex
cavity through spin-resolved measurements. Remarkably, we confirm the
spin-orbital angular momentum locking in such radiation due to the spin-valley
locking and inter-valley couplings. We demonstrate that the spin-orbital
angular momentum locking is controlled by the chirality of the Kekul\'e
modulation and propose design schemes for arbitrary-order single-mode OAM
radiation.

Abstract: Coreshell nanoparticles can combine optical features of different materials
in a single nanostructure, which makes them interesting for many applications
from biomedicine to energy harvesting. On the other hand, periodic arrays of
plasmonic nanoparticles can exhibit topological phenomena such as topological
edge states. Here we study periodic chains of Si@Ag coreshell nanoparticles.
For this task, we combine the hybridization of surface plasmonic modes in
complex nanostructures with the coupled electric dipole formalism employed for
modelling the scattering of light by periodic arrays of small plasmonic
nanoparticles. We propose treating coreshell nanoparticle as several coupled
electric dipoles instead of just one and show how this is a more appropriate
framework to study arrays of coreshell nanoparticles, which allows to build a
one-to-one connection between the resonant modes of the nanoparticles and the
dispersion bands of the system. Within this formalism, we show that a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain of coreshell Si@Ag nanoparticles host multiple
topological edge states pinned at the resonant frequencies of the coreshell
nanoparticles.

Abstract: We demonstrate an electronic-photonic (EP) interface for multiuser optical

(MBOPA) along with co-integrated electro-optic (EO) modulators and high-speed
CMOS drivers. The MBOPA leverages a path-length difference in the optical
phased array (OPA) along with wavelength-division multiplexing technology for
spatial carrier aggregation and multiplexing. To generate two and four pulsed
amplitude modulation signals, and transmit them to multiple users, we employ an
optical digital-to-analog converter technique by using two traveling-wave
electrode Mach-Zehnder modulators, which are monolithically integrated with
high-speed, wide-output-swing CMOS drivers. The MBOPA and monolithic EO
modulator are implemented by silica wafer through planar lightwave circuit
fabrication process and a 45-nm monolithic silicon photonics technology,
respectively. We measured and analyzed two-channel parallel communication at a
data rate of 54 Gbps per user over the wireless distance of 1 m. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first system level demonstration of the multi-user
OWC using the in-house-designed photonic and monolithically integrated chips.
Finally, we suggest best modulation format for different data rate and the
number of multibeams, considering effects of the proposed OPA and the
monolithic modulator.

Abstract: Thin dielectric films are known to show distinct colors, responsible for the

Fabry-P\'erot resonator, that we name conductor-dielectric-conductor (CDC)
matched cavity, appears instead completely grey when observed under ordinary
conditions (i.e. by analyzing the transmitted or reflected incoherent white
light). Nonetheless, the matched CDC cavity still retains spectral information,
that clearly appear when the cavity is analyzed by the coherent absorption
technique. The CDC system is simply a dielectric thin film sandwiched by two
conducting interfaces, whose conductivity shall be appropriately matched
depending upon the dielectric refractive index. In practical applications, the
ideal conducting interfaces can be safely replaced by thin metal films, making
the system easily applicable in particular for cryptographic purposes. We
indeed demonstrated experimentally that a visually recognizable thin-film color
pattern can be concealed to an ordinary observer, and finally recovered through
a dedicated coherent absorption decoding apparatus.

Abstract: Self-trapping is a hallmark phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. It has
significant applications in modern physics, including band structure
engineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from
interatomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics.
In this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit
coupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced
spin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that
facilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled
system. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between
these eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed
state and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the
time-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the
transition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a
dynamical phase transition in the system.

Abstract: At low temperature T we expect vacuum tunneling processes to occur in
superfluid $^{4}$ He films. We distinguish between extrinsic processes, in
which single vortices nucleate by tunneling off boundaries in the system, and
intrinsic processes, in which vortex/anti-vortex pairs nucleate far from
boundaries. It is crucial to incorporate the varying effective mass of the
vortex in tunneling calculations. The intrinsic processes are the superfluid
analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in quantum field theory; here they appear
as a quantum phase transition at T = 0, driven by an external supercurrent. We
calculate the tunneling rate for these processes, and describe a means of
testing the predictions using a specific vortex counting experiment.

in classical and quantum gravity; (ii) how do analogies between these systems
work, how well do they work, and how useful are they; (iii) what modifications
can we make to quantum mechanics to deal with quantum gravity, and (iv) how and

make progress in this field. We use many different examples to illustrate our
arguments.

Abstract: Quantum droplets, stabilized by beyond-mean-field effects, represent a novel
state of matter in quantum many-body systems. While previous studies have
focused primarily on dipolar and contact-interacting systems, quadrupolar
condensates remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we explore the
formation, structural properties, and dynamical behaviors of quantum droplets
in a two-component quadrupolar Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a
quasi-two-dimensional geometry. Analytical results obtained via the
Thomas-Fermi approximation predict flat-topped density profiles and linear
scaling between effective area and particle number. These predictions are
corroborated by numerical simulations, which also reveal the saturation of peak
density and chemical potential at large norm. Furthermore, vortex quantum
droplets exhibit anisotropic elliptical morphologies due to the directional
nature of QQIs, with their aspect ratios significantly tunable by varying the
particle number and quadrupolar interaction strength. Collision dynamics
demonstrate rich behavior modulated by velocity and topology: ground-state
droplets transition from inelastic merging to quasi-elastic scattering and
quantum penetration, while vortex droplets exhibit phase-induced repulsion,
fragmentation, and topologically protected tunneling. These findings offer a
comprehensive understanding of how higher-order interactions and quantum
fluctuations govern the formation and stability of quadrupolar droplets. This
work lays a theoretical foundation for experimental realization and opens new
directions for exploring anisotropic quantum fluids, topological excitations,
and applications in quantum sensing and simulation.

Abstract: Due to its peculiar superfluid-crystal duality feature, supersolid has
received great research interest. Recently, researchers have paid much
attention to its elastic response properties; however, the inelastic
deformation has barely been explored. In this work, we study the transition
from elastic to inelastic deformation of a dipolar supersolid Bose-Einstein
condensate trapped in a box potential (i.e., a dipolar supersolid with finite
size). We obtained the stationary supersolid states (both ground and excited)
of the system, and examined the relation between the supersolid size and the
number of unit cells it can accommodate, which can essentially help us to
understand the dynamical responses of the supersolid during a dilation or
compression process. We found that within a certain dilation or compression
extent, the supersolid can retain its original crystal structure, that is, it
endures an elastic deformation; however, when the extent exceeds a critical
threshold, the original crystal structure of the supersolid will be disrupted,
which signifies an inelastic deformation. Furthermore, we both analytically and
numerically determined the critical point of the transition from elastic to
inelastic deformation, and mapped out a phase diagram. These results open up
new territory in the research of supersolid mechanical properties, and may find
applications in quantum material science and quantum-based technologies.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for
exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range
interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D
remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the
creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D
harmonic trap with tunable dipole orientation. By investigating scale
invariance properties through breathing collective mode measurements, we
observe significant breaking of scale invariance when dipoles are tilted
in-plane indicating the dominance of the nonlocal dipole-dipole interactions
(DDIs) in this regime. Interestingly, the breaking of the scale invariant
dynamics is accompanied by an increase in quantum fluctuations, as shown by
comparison with mean-field and beyond mean-field theoretical studies. Our
experiments also reveal that at critical tilt angles around 70{\deg},
stripe-type density modulations emerge, suggesting the presence of a roton
spectrum in 2D, while the system still shows hydrodynamic nature with the
phase-locking breathing behavior. This observation elucidates the many-body
effect induced by DDIs in 2D, thus marking a crucial step toward realizing 2D
supersolids and other exotic quantum phases.

transitions in the heliumlike systems of the isotopes $^{12,13,14}$C. The
metastable triplet state was efficiently populated in an electron beam ion
source and the C$^{4+}$ ions were electrostatically accelerated to 50\,keV to
perform collinear laser spectroscopy. From the determined transition
frequencies, the splitting isotope shift (SIS), i.e., the difference in
fine-structure splittings between different isotopes of the same element, was
extracted. In the SIS, theoretical uncertainties due to higher-order quantum
electrodynamic corrections are strongly suppressed since they are independent
of both nuclear mass and the fine-structure quantum number $J$ in lowest order.
Comparison with theory provides an important test of experimental accuracy,
particularly in the $^{13}$C$^{4+}$ case, for which the nuclear spin leads to
hyperfine-induced fine-structure mixing. At the same time, the even-even
isotopes $^{12,14}$C$^{4+}$ without nuclear spin can be used to confirm theory.
Theoretical values of the SIS are given for all the heliumlike ions with $2\le

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and time of experimental exploration of hard carbon synthesis and structural optimization for sodium-ion batteries motivates this investigation of machine learning approaches

Method: Four machine learning models (MLMs) were trained using data augmented with TabPFN to predict HC capacity and Coulombic efficiency. SHAP and PDP analyses were performed to identify key factors influencing HC performance. Experimental samples synthesized using the ML framework were tested to validate predictions.

Result: The XGBoost model achieved high accuracy (R²=0.854 for capacity, R²=0.868 for ICE) with low prediction errors (23.290 mAh g⁻¹, 3.813% ICE). SHAP and PDP analyses identified carbonization temperature as the most important factor. Experimental results closely matched predictions.

Conclusion: Machine learning provides an efficient framework for systematically identifying high-performance hard carbon materials for sodium-ion batteries.

Abstract: Biomass-derived hard carbon has become the most promising anode material for
sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high capacity and excellent cycling
stability. However, the effects of synthesis parameters and structural features
on hard carbon's (HC) electrochemical performance are still unclear, requiring
time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental investigations. Machine
learning (ML) offers a promising solution by training on large datasets to
predict hard carbon performance more efficiently, saving time and resources. In
this study, four ML models were used to predict the capacity and initial
Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC. Data augmentation based on the TabPFN
technique was employed to improve model robustness under limited data
conditions, and the relationships between features and electrochemical
performance were examined. Notably, the XGBoost model achieved an R2 of 0.854
and an RMSE of 23.290 mAh g-1 for capacity prediction, and an R2 of 0.868 and
an RMSE of 3.813% for ICE prediction. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and
Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses identified carbonization temperature
(Temperature_2) as the most important factor influencing both capacity and ICE.
Furthermore, we used bamboo as the precursor to synthesize four hard carbons
based on the predictive approach. The electrochemical performance of these
samples closely matched our predictions. By leveraging machine-learning
approach, this study provides an efficient framework for accelerating the
screening process of biomass-derived hard carbon candidates.

Abstract: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) leverages the nuclear reaction between
thermal neutrons and boron-10 (B-10) atoms to induce selective tumor cell
death. The spatial and quantum mechanical overlap between the neutron
wavefunction and B-10 nuclei encapsulated in carborane cages (C2B10H12) is
fundamental to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a quantum
mechanical framework to evaluate the neutron-boron interaction probability by
modeling neutron wavefunctions and the spatial distribution of boron atoms
within the carborane cages. Using spherical harmonics and density functional
theory (DFT)-derived geometries of carborane, the neutron scattering amplitudes
and reaction cross sections are quantitatively analyzed. The implications of
neutron spin states, nuclear magnetic moments, and external perturbations on
the neutron capture probability are discussed. The computed neutron scattering
amplitudes and reaction cross sections provide a basis for evaluating
neutron-boron interaction probabilities under varied quantum conditions. The
proposed model offers theoretical insights into molecular-level design
considerations for enhancing the efficiency of BNCT.

Abstract: We investigate two nitrogen-containing isomers of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), quinoline (Q) and isoquinoline (IQ), of composition
C$_9$H$_7$N in collisions with 7~keV O$^+$ and 48~keV O$^{6+}$ projectile ions.
Employing ion-ion coincidence mass spectrometry, we determine branching ratios
for H-loss, C$_2$H$_2$-loss, and HCN-loss dissociation channels of Q$^{2+}$ and
IQ$^{2+}$. The overall contribution of HCN-loss is found to be the dominant
decay channel. A comparison with the results of a parallel experiment on
naphthalene, the simplest PAH, reveals that HCN-loss in both isomers has a
higher propensity than the analogous C$_2$H$_2$-loss of naphthalene. The
positional identity of the nitrogen atom in the two isomers mainly manifests in
many-body fragmentation of their dications. Potential energy surfaces of
Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$ are further computed to explore complete fragmentation
mechanisms. Parent dications (Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$) are identified to
isomerize via seven-membered ring structures prior to elimination of C$_2$H$_2$
and HCN. While prompt dissociation is the primary pathway, the dominant channel
of each neutral-loss class also exhibits delayed fragmentation.

Abstract: Polymers are a versatile class of materials with widespread industrial
applications. Advanced computational tools could revolutionize their design,
but their complex, multi-scale nature poses significant modeling challenges.
Conventional force fields often lack the accuracy and transferability required
to capture the intricate interactions governing polymer behavior. Conversely,
quantum-chemical methods are computationally prohibitive for the large systems
and long timescales required to simulate relevant polymer phenomena. Here, we
overcome these limitations with a machine learning force field (MLFF) approach.
We demonstrate that macroscopic properties for a broad range of polymers can be
predicted ab initio, without fitting to experimental data. Specifically, we
develop a fast and scalable MLFF to accurately predict polymer densities,
outperforming established classical force fields. Our MLFF also captures
second-order phase transitions, enabling the prediction of glass transition
temperatures. To accelerate progress in this domain, we introduce a benchmark
of experimental bulk properties for 130 polymers and an accompanying
quantum-chemical dataset. This work lays the foundation for a fully in silico
design pipeline for next-generation polymeric materials.

Abstract: Exact black holes in the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg theory are explored with
an exponential entropy framework by using the topological current
$\Psi$-mapping theory. The topology classes are investigated through the
canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles. In particular, the magnetic
charge is fixed for the canonical ensemble, whereas the magnetic potential is
included for the mixed ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble with
maintaining its consistency through the magnetic potential. The topological
charges are analyzed for each ensemble through critical points. As a result, it
is found that the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles lead to
either $1$, $-1$, or no generation/annihilation points. Moreover, it is shown
how temperature and heat capacity depend on the horizon radius in order to
verify the stability of a black hole. Furthermore, the behavior of the
thermodynamic curvatures of a black hole is investigated through the geometric

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores the thermodynamic aspects of f(Q, T) gravity, establishing the first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of a flat FLRW universe using the Gibbs relation. It evaluates the validity of the generalized second law for various models, such as linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and cross-coupling models, and concludes that linear and mildly nonlinear models are generally thermodynamically consistent, whereas strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require fine-tuned parameters for the generalized second law to hold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the thermodynamic aspects of modified gravity theories, particularly f(Q, T) gravity, is essential for understanding their compatibility with thermodynamics and for assessing their viability in cosmological contexts.

Method: The authors derived the expressions for entropy, energy, and temperature associated with the apparent horizon in f(Q, T) gravity using the Gibbs relation. They then analyzed the generalized second law of thermodynamics by examining the rate of change of total entropy for various models.

Result: The analysis reveals that simpler models (linear and mildly nonlinear) are thermodynamically consistent, whereas more complex models (strongly nonlinear or interaction-type) require specific parameter conditions for the generalized second law to hold.

Conclusion: The thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that f(Q, T) gravity models can provide viable alternatives to explain cosmic acceleration, emphasizing the role of thermodynamics in assessing the feasibility of modified gravity theories.

Abstract: Late-time cosmic acceleration has motivated the exploration of various
extensions of general relativity, among which $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, based
on the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the trace of the energy--momentum tensor
$\mathcal{T}$, has gained increasing attention. In this study, we explore the
thermodynamic aspects of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity by establishing the first
law and generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of a
flat FLRW universe. By applying the Gibbs relation, we determined the rate of
change of the total entropy and assessed the conditions under which the
generalized second law remains valid for various choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$.
Our analysis focuses on linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and
cross-coupling models, inspired by frameworks such as $f(R,\mathcal{T})$,
$f(T)$, and modifications motivated by string theory. Our analysis showed that
linear and mildly nonlinear models are generally thermodynamically consistent,
whereas strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require fine-tuned
parameters for the generalized second law to hold. The present analysis
underscores that thermodynamic considerations serve as effective criteria for
assessing the viability of modified gravity models and their relevance to
cosmological dynamics.

*Luciano Rezzolla,Christian Ecker*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The maximum compactness of neutron stars is at most 1/3, independently of their masses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates the maximum compactness (C = M/R) of neutron stars, motivated by the need to understand their gravitational and nuclear aspects.

Method: A statistical approach was taken by considering numerous EOSs, analyzing sequences of nonrotating stars, and applying perturbative-QCD constraints.

Result: The maximum compactness is bounded above by 1/3, a limit primarily determined by perturbative-QCD.

Conclusion: This finding provides a fundamental upper limit on neutron star compactness, irrespective of their masses.

Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass
and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in
characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars.
Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of
state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron
star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical
approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all
known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics
(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given
EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of
the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture
for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.
However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that
it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the
compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for
the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$.
Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass
and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.

Abstract: These proceedings summarize some recent efforts in understanding a class of
vector-tensor theories known as {\it bumblebee} models, which spontaneously
break local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. Using cosmological
perturbation theory on an exact dS background, we find that for non-minimal
coupling to gravity, the theory contains a ghost mode unless a degeneracy
condition is imposed, after which the model becomes a subset of generalized
Proca theory. We go further to show that scalar perturbations become strongly
coupled in the minimal-coupling limit, which shows the necessity of the
non-minimal coupling. Moreover, we find a constraint on the bumblebee field
from the speed of tensor modes on the order of $10^{-15}$.

Motivation: 理解量子纠缠和相干性在强引力场中的表现对于量子信息处理具有重要意义。

Method: 使用量子纠缠性和相干性的度量方法，结合数值模拟分析不同维度下的量子态行为。

Result: 在d>5时，测量不确定性随黑洞半径增加而递减，相干性增加；d=5时，两者均呈现非单调性。W态对相干性更稳定，GHZ态对测量不确定性更稳健。两种配置下，量子相干性在第1种配置下始终更低，测量不确定性则相反。

Conclusion: 不同量子态和配置在强引力场中表现出独特的量子特性，为量子信息处理提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We investigate tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertain and
quantum coherence for GHZ and W states of a fermionic field in the background
of a spherically symmetric black hole of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity.
Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and
Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in
the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is
observed: in $d>5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases
monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in
$d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive
thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W
state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state
shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking
radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors:
quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near
horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of
the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower
uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend,
with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that
the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights
into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information
processing in curved spacetime.

### [80] [Singularity avoidance in black hole interiors by quantum gravity effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13175)
*Takeshi Chiba,Hiroki Matsui,Keiju Murata*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates the quantum nature of a black hole's interior using the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with the KS metric, demonstrating how quantum effects potentially avoid singularity formation by lengthening the time to singularity formation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum gravity effects near black hole singularities is crucial for reconciling general relativity and quantum mechanics, and this paper explores how quantum effects might prevent singularity formation.

Method: The authors use the WDW equation derived from the KS metric and vary the gravitational constant to study quantum effects on black hole interior dynamics. They introduce an internal clock to measure the time to singularity formation.

Result: As quantum effects increase, the time to singularity formation also increases, suggesting that quantum gravity effects lead to singularity avoidance.

Conclusion: This study provides numerical evidence that quantum gravity effects could prevent singularity formation in black holes by extending the duration of the collapse process.

Abstract: The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated
through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static,
spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS)
metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the
Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole
interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational
constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the
solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the
parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave
packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole
interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet
deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of
singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate
"clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation
with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead
to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of
singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Discrete space explains a big bang bounce and leads to a thermal particle spectrum in a bouncing universe.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the early universe requires resolving singularities like the big bang. The bouncing universe model offers a solution, so studying its implications is key.

Method: Used quantum field theory on curved backgrounds and numerical simulations to examine particle creation during the bounce.

Result: Particle production peaks during the bounce, evolving to a thermal-like spectrum over time. This behavior is consistent with semiclassical gravity predictions, linking geometry and particle production.

Conclusion: Discrete space in the universe could explain the bounce and the observed particle spectrum, supporting the idea that quantum effects and thermodynamics are intertwined in cosmology.

Abstract: In massless scalar field cosmology, imposing the universe's physical volume
as fundamentally discrete resolves the big bang singularity via a big bounce.
We use quantum field theory on curved background to numerically track the
number of particles created in the vacuum of a quantum field that propagates
through the cosmological bounce. We find that due to geometry's evolution,
particle production in all modes initially rises, sharply peaks at the bounce,
and varies slowly afterwards. Further, by comparing with the case of a quantum
field propagating on an expanding universe, we discover that the bouncing
universe's imprints on quantum matter are distinct: notably, the late time
particle production across modes resembles a thermal spectrum. We then use
semiclassical gravity and find similar qualitative results. Here, we also
determine how particle production affects geometry's evolution. Our study adds
to existing literature on gravity-matter interactions in the context of a
bouncing universe, contributes to searches of a bouncing universe's signatures,
and strengthens the link between gravity and thermodynamics.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将Lyapunov指数和准周期振荡用于AdS黑洞相态结构研究，发现热力学相变会显著改变动力学特性，为研究黑洞动力学与相变提供新视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase structure of a nonminimal coupled
magnetic AdS black hole by connecting its thermodynamic properties with the
dynamical behavior of orbiting particles, within the framework of Lyapunov
exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation. The analysis of the free energy as a
function of the Hawking temperature reveals a Van der Waals-like phase
transition, characterized by the coexistence of small, intermediate, and large
black hole phases. By examining timelike geodesics corresponding to unstable
circular orbits, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of the test particles
crossing the phase transition and explore its role as dynamical indicator of
stability. Furthermore, by perturbing the unstable circular orbit and employing
the relativistic precession model, we explore the associated upper and lower
quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies. Our findings show that the occurrence
of thermodynamic phase transitions induces marked changes in both Lyapunov
exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation spectra, indicating that these
dynamical quantities can serve as sensitive probes of the underlying
thermodynamic phase structure of the black hole.

Conclusion: 磁场自旋增强预cession，为观察提供新的方法。

Abstract: We study the orbital structure and precession dynamics of neutral test
particles in the magnetized Kerr black hole (MKBH) spacetime-an exact
electrovacuum solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that self-consistently
incorporates the curvature effects of an external magnetic field. This geometry
allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak
to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field
strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist,
establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical
fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which
defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the
conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion
within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and
vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show
substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced
reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For
astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession
could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a
potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization. These findings highlight the
geometric influence of magnetic curvature on strong-field dynamics, providing a
self-consistent framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenology
and potential magnetic imprints in precision timing observations of compact
objects.

### [84] [Mass and spin coevolution of black holes inspiralling through dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13604)
*Theophanes K. Karydas,Rodrigo Vicente,Gianfranco Bertone*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The companion black hole's spin affects how DM is accreted and how its spin evolves. Higher spins slow accretion but enhance spin torque, leading to spin-down and alignment with the orbital plane. DM accretion shows a universal mass-spin correlation and can lead to observable spin evolution over astrophysical timescales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of spin on DM accretion and spin evolution is crucial for distinguishing IMRIs from other astrophysical sources, as well as constraining the presence of dark matter environments.

Method: Theoretical analysis of E/IMRIs focusing on spin effects on DM accretion and spin evolution.

Result: Higher spin companions suppress accretion rates but enhance torque, leading to spin-down and alignment. DM accretion shows a near-universal mass-spin correlation (s ≈ 2.8), independent of local DM density and spike slope. Spin evolution due to accretion can be observed over astrophysical timescales.

Conclusion: These findings help constrain dark matter environments and distinguish IMRIs from other astrophysical sources.

Abstract: In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in
dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless
particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls
this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of
the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass
accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down
and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane.
Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin
correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much
larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely
independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated
spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of
rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM
environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from
dynamical friction.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: APRIL enhances PINNs for GW parameter estimation, improving accuracy and physical consistency, especially for elusive parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are widely used but face scalability issues with datasets of varying parameters. This paper specifically addresses this limitation by introducing APRIL, enhancing PINNs' applicability to scenarios with multiple similar physical systems.

Method: APRIL involves augmenting the standard PINN loss function with auxiliary terms based on physical redundancies. This approach maintains the model's ability to adhere to physical laws while improving convergence and accuracy, particularly in challenging parameter spaces.

Result: The study demonstrates APRIL's effectiveness through a benchmark on gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation using simulated signals. It shows significant improvements in test accuracy, especially for parameters like chirp mass, making it suitable for future GW analyses with noise and extended parameter ranges.

Conclusion: APRIL establishes a robust method for enhancing PINNs, enabling consistent and accurate learning from large multi-system datasets, with particular benefits for GW analyses where realistic noise and extensive parameter variations are prevalent.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential
equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of
Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective
for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing
many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To
address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including
auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the
standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact
physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that
these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss
landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a
proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for
gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free
compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency
waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass
$M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this
controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude
improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise
difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for
large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving
realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.

Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry provides a novel approach to probe quantum
gravity effects in black hole spacetimes. This work explores Dirac quasinormal
modes (QNMs) of a deformed Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where
noncommutativity induces an effective metric with an additional ($ r-\varphi$)
component. Employing a semiclassical model equivalent to a NC gauge theory, we
investigate the dynamics of massless Dirac fields and calculate their QNM
frequencies using the continued fraction method, enhanced by Gauss elimination
to address the six-term recurrence relations. Our results demonstrate notable
shifts in oscillation frequencies and damping rates relative to the commutative
Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, exhibiting a distinctive Zeeman-like splitting in
the QNM spectrum driven by the NC parameter.

TL;DR: This paper explores the generation and implications of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). The authors examine the evolution of an electromagnetic field through a quantum bounce and subsequent inflation, analyzing scale-dependent power spectra under various conditions. They also discuss coupling functions, backreaction, and the potential observability of PMFs today.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origin of PMFs and their connection to extragalactic magnetic fields is crucial for advancing primordial physics knowledge. Observing extragalactic fields could provide insights into the early universe's magnetic field origins.

Method: The study employs loop quantum cosmology, modeling an electromagnetic field's evolution through a quantum bounce and inflation. The authors analyze power spectra, consider different initial conditions, examine coupling functions, assess backreaction, and calculate observable PMF levels.

Result: The research reveals that LQC leads to scale-dependent power spectra for PMFs. By varying initial conditions and coupling functions, the study demonstrates the impact on PMF generation. Backreaction effects are incorporated, and the amount of PMF that could be measured today is quantified.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to understanding PMF generation in LQC, highlighting the importance of scale-dependent spectra and providing insights into observable PMF levels through cosmic inflation and bounce mechanisms.

Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the
early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic
magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are
indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that
observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the
primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the
primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In
LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an
electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its
evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We
investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is
scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions,
discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and
compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We
conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.

Abstract: In this paper, we primarily construct Darboux transformation(DT) of the

which is first proposed by the connection with a nonlocal coupled modified

solutions for the nonlocal cm-CID equation under vanishing and non-vanishing
boundary conditions. Soliton-type solutions include periodic wave, growing-,
decaying-periodic wave, periodic-like wave (which consists of a mixture of
periodic wave and breather wave, a combination of periodic wave and background
plane), breather-like wave and rational solution. Furthermore, we have also
analyzed asymptotic behavior and properties of these solutions theoretically
and graphically. We must emphasis that soliton solutions of the nonlocal cm-CID
equation possess novel properties that are distinct from those of the cm-CID
equation, such as the nonlocal cm-CID equation has the growing-,
decaying-periodic solution and periodic-like solution. The implications of
these findings could potentially contribute to the description of optical pulse

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the reliability of the SPIRAL2 accelerator by detecting and classifying anomalies in real-time using advanced machine learning techniques.

Method: The study uses time series data from the accelerator's LLRF systems, applies feature selection via Time2Feat, and employs clustering dashboards, utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbours classifier for anomaly detection.

Result: The proposed method successfully distinguishes between electronic quenches and false quench alarms, offering a more reliable and efficient monitoring system.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advancement in using machine learning for accelerator reliability, with potential applications beyond the SPIRAL2 system.

Abstract: SPIRAL2 is a state-of-the-art superconducting linear accelerator for heavy
ions. The radiofrequency operation of the linac can be disrupted by anomalies
that affect its reliability. This work leverages fast, multivariate time series
post-mortem data from the Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) systems to
differentiate anomaly groups. However, interpreting these anomalies
traditionally relies on expert analysis, with certain behaviours remaining
obscure even to experienced observers. By adopting the Time2Feat pipeline, this
study explores the interpretability of anomalies through feature selection,
paving the way for real-time state observers. Clustering dashboards are
presented, allowing the use of multiple clustering algorithms easily
configurable and tools to help for visualizing results. A case study on
distinguishing electronic quenches and false quench alarms in postmortem data
is highlighted. Thereby, a fast and reliable K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

Motivation: The need for high-quality soft X-ray APTs to study electron dynamics in various systems, including biological and quantum materials.

Method: The method involves using waveform synthesis of the echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) free-electron laser (FEL) to enable successive FEL lasing in multiple harmonic numbers, followed by coherent waveform synthesis to achieve APT generation.

Result: Three-dimensional simulations demonstrate that coherent APTs with peak power 3.5 GW and micropulse duration 160 as can be achieved using five-harmonic synthesis. The micropulse duration and spectral components can be easily adjusted.

Conclusion: The method establishes a robust platform for attosecond science in the soft X-ray regime, enabling unprecedented insights into electron dynamics across diverse fields.

Abstract: Attosecond pulse trains (APTs) are indispensable for probing electron
dynamics at their intrinsic timescales. High harmonic generation (HHG) has long
been a successful and widely used technique in producing extreme ultraviolet
APTs. While in the soft X-ray regime, HHG suffers from low conversion
efficiency and lacking flexibility in the waveform and spectrum control. Here
in this study, based on the waveform synthesis of the echo-enabled harmonic
generation (EEHG) free-electron laser (FEL), we propose a novel method that can
generate soft X-ray APTs with high temporal and spectral tunability. EEHG
scheme is well-known in forming phase-locked high harmonic bunching combs down
to the soft X-ray regime. And We can facilitate successive FEL lasing in
several different harmonic numbers and then perform the coherent waveform
synthesis to generate soft X-ray APTs. Three-dimensional simulation results
indicate that reproducible generation of coherent APTs in the soft X-ray regime
with peak power of 3.5 GW and micropulse duration of 160 as can be achieved by
five-harmonic synthesis. And the micropulse duration together with the spectral
components of the APTs can be adjusted easily according to the programmable
high harmonic bunching combs in the EEHG scheme. This method has the potential
to establish a robust platform for attosecond sciences in the soft X-ray
regime, which can enable unprecedented studies of electron dynamics in physical
and chemical reactions, biological systems and quantum materials.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Radio Frequency System-onChip (RFSoC) technology
from Xilinx (AMD) has enabled the integration of high-speed data converters and
programmable logic within a single package. RFSoC platforms are already widely
adopted in telecommunications, radar, and satellite communications, where they
promise reductions in system footprint and power consumption. However, their
suitability for Low-Level RF (LLRF) control systems in accelerator environments
- where stability requirements are critical - has not been quantitatively
evaluated. This paper presents a comparative measurement-based assessment of
RFSoC-based and conventional LLRF designs, focusing on signal fidelity, phase
noise, latency, system complexity, and integration challenges. The advantages
and challenges of adopting RFSoC-based direct conversion architectures are
discussed, providing guidance for future LLRF system implementations.

Abstract: Inspired by the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, we present exact
solutions for a spin-1 chain with Kitaev-like couplings. We consider an
expanded Kitaev model with bilinear and biquadratic terms. At an exactly
solvable point, the Hamiltonian can be reexpressed as a sum of projection
operators. Unlike the AKLT model where projectors act on total spin, we project
onto components of spin along the bond direction. This leads to exponential
ground state degeneracy, expressed in terms of fractionalized
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ objects. Each ground state can be expressed concisely as a
matrix product state. We construct a phase diagram by varying the relative
strength of bilinear and biquadratic terms. The fractionalized states provide a
qualitative picture for the spin-1 Kitaev model, yielding approximate forms for
the ground state and low-lying excitations.

Abstract: The newly discovered kagome superconductor CsCr3Sb5 exhibits distinct
features with flat bands and unique magnetism, providing a compelling platform
for exploring novel quantum states of correlated electron systems. Emergent
charge order in this material is a key for understanding unconventional
superconductivity, but it remains unexplored at the atomic scale and the
underlying physics is elusive. Here, we identify and unreported stripe orders
on the surface which are distinct from the bulk and investigate the underlying
bulk electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, a mixture of 2a0 * a0 and 3a0 * a0
stripe order is found on Cs-terminated surface while 4a0 * root3a0 stripe order
is found on the Sb-terminated surface. The electronic spectra exhibit strongly
correlated features resembling that of high temperature superconductors, with
kagome flat bands lying about 330 meV above EF, suggesting that the electron
correlations arise from Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling. Moreover, a
distinct electron-boson coupling mode is observed at approximately 100 meV.
These findings provide new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk
charge orders in this strongly correlated kagome system.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) is a well-established tool for
probing excitations in a wide range of materials. The measured spectra strongly
depend on the scattering geometry, via its influence on the polarization of the
incoming and outgoing light. By employing a tensor representation of the
4-point response function that governs the RIXS intensity, we disentangle the
experimental geometry from the intrinsic material properties. In dipole-dipole
RIXS processes and low-symmetry crystals, up to 81 linearly independent
fundamental spectra can be measured as a function of light polarization.
However, for crystals or molecules with symmetry, the number of independent
fundamental spectra that define the RIXS tensor is significantly reduced.
  This work presents a systematic framework for determining the number of
fundamental spectra and expressing the RIXS tensor in terms of these
fundamental components. Given a specific experimental geometry, the measured
spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental
spectra. To validate our approach, we performed calculations for different
point group symmetries, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Within
the same framework, we derived expressions for powder spectra in
momentum-independent processes and spectra obtained using Bragg spectrometers.
This formalism provides a valuable toolkit for optimizing experiment planning,
data interpretation, and RIXS simulation.

Abstract: We consider a lattice model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG). The presence
of incommensurate angles produces an emerging quasi-periodicity manifesting
itself in large momenta Umklapp interactions that almost connect the Dirac
points. We rigorously establish the stability of the semimetallic phase via a
Renormalization Group analysis combined with number theoretical properties of
irrationals, similar to the ones used in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory
for the stability of invariant tori. The interlayer hopping is weak and short
ranged and the angles are chosen in a large measure set. The result provides a
justification, in the above regime, to the effective continuum description of
TBG in which large momenta interlayer interactions are neglected.

Abstract: Using bulk gapless topological superconductors in both 1d and 2d as free
fermion model examples, we demonstrate the power of subsystem correlation
spectrum (the spectrum of correlation matrix), or equivalently the entanglement
spectrum for the case of free fermions, in characterizing the topology of the
non-trivial ground state. For the systems considered, we show that signatures
of the lowenergy spectrum, including both the edge modes and the bulk modes,
appear in the correlation spectrum, albeit with different behaviors. This work
generalizes the 2d Li-Haldane entanglement spectrum characterization of
topological edge states to 2d topological systems with gapless bulk.

Conclusion: 通过在 Kagome 格点中引入 frustrating 参数，研究了 competing 相关性，并揭示了量子磁性与热响应之间的复杂相互作用，为了解 correlated states 在复杂系统中的行为提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental progress in pyrochlore derivative
\ce{RE3Sb3A2O14 (A=Mg, Zn)}, we investigate the Hubbard model on the kagome
lattice with an additional hopping $t'/t$, which enables continuous
interpolation between the kagome and triangular lattices by using determinant
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the evolution of magnetic
correlations and thermodynamic responses across different values of $t'/t$ and
on-site interaction $U$. It is found that increasing $t'/t$ suppresses
short-range antiferromagnetic correlations, while the next-nearest-neighbor
correlations exhibit a sign change near $t'/t \approx 0.3 \text{--} 0.4$.
Within this regime, the specific heat shows a pronounced low-temperature peak,
indicating an emergent spin-related energy scale. Increasing $U$ enhances
magnetic correlations and shifts the associated $t'/t$ crossover points to
larger values. We also discuss the sign problem to clarify which parameter
region of our numerical simulations is accessible and reliable. Our results
uncover the competition between frustration and correlations and the interplay
of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome lattice, providing
insights into correlated states in frustrated materials.

Abstract: First-order phase transitions, characterized by a discontinuous change in the
order parameter, are intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics. However,
the underlying, material-specific, microscopic mechanisms often remain unclear.
Here, we unveil a high-temperature incommensurate charge-order precursor with
the wave vector $\mathbf{q}^* = (0, \frac{1}{4}+\delta, \frac{1}{2})$ in the
1T' phase of TaTe$_2$, which competes with fluctuating high-temperature Ta
trimer bonding states at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO} =(0, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$. The
precursor state follows the temperature dependence of the hidden
incommensurability of the $\textit{quasi}$-1D nested Fermi surface. In
contrast, the low-temperature commensurate charge order at
$\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO}$, characterized by a charge disproportionation of the
inequivalent Ta sites, appears to be driven by local chemical bonding.
Dynamical lattice calculations identify an imaginary optical mode at
$\mathbf{q}^*$, involving an in-plane vibration of the Ta atoms forming a
chain-like structure that renormalizes below $T_\mathrm{CO}$. Our experimental
and theoretical observations suggest that the controversial first-order phase
transition, as captured by phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, results
from the competition between two order parameters: one involving Fermi surface
nesting and the other involving local chemical bonding.

Conclusion: Fe磁顺序在CeAlSi中提高了Weyl节点能靠近E水平，导致历史上发Shubnikov-deHaas 振荡和场致Li u转变。这表明RKKY相互作用在这里扮演了关键角色。看到了类I Johnstone斯体的可能性，下面的工作应该包括更细致地确定Pivot物的结构和键合机制。

Abstract: The Weyl semimetal CeAlSi crystallises in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal
space group $I4_1md$ and exhibits ferromagnetic order below 8 K, thereby
breaking both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This unique
combination of properties establishes CeAlSi as a model system for studying the
interplay between non-trivial topological states and strong electron
correlations. In this work, we report observations of Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in the electrical resistivity under magnetic fields up to 68 T
applied parallel to the [001] crystallographic axis. Our measurements reveal an
abrupt change in the oscillation frequencies near 14 T, which is indicative of
a field-induced Lifshitz transition. Additionally, our results are consistent
with the ferromagnetic order bringing the Weyl nodes closer to the Fermi level
in CeAlSi. Furthermore, they suggest that the RKKY interaction plays an
important role.

Abstract: We develop a nonequilibrium multi-orbital extension of the two-particle
self-consistent theory and apply it to the bilayer Hubbard model as a minimal
platform to investigate correlation effects in the presence of interlayer
interactions and tunneling. The method determines vertex corrections in the
spin and charge channels self-consistently at the two-particle level, thereby
avoiding the spurious finite-temperature phase transitions that limit dynamical
mean-field theory in two dimensions. We derive the spectral self-energy and
implement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh
nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical
analytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can
emerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic
fluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels
are also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space.
Remarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing
interlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge
imbalance between the layers. This work establishes a versatile and
computationally efficient framework for investigating correlated multi-orbital
systems under nonequilibrium conditions.

Abstract: Reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for time series
modelling and forecasting including the prediction of discontinuous
transitions. However, the mechanism behind its success is not yet fully
understood. This letter elucidates the functioning of reservoir computing by
examining its successful prediction of boundary and attractor merging crises.
We investigate in detail how reservoirs's internal dynamics mimic the actual
system, that enables it to accurately reproduce the scaling exponent near
boundary crisis. We establish this across distinct systems, exemplified by the
logistic and Gauss maps. The study contributes to the broader understanding of
the internal dynamics that enable learning algorithms to anticipate critical
transitions.

Motivation: The motivation is to improve the detector's radiation tolerance under high-luminosity conditions.

Method: The study involved collaboration between CMS, FBK, and CNM. The sensors are read out using RD53A and CROCv1 chips. Beam test experiments were conducted up to a fluence of 2.6×10¹⁶ n_{eq}/cm².

Result: Sensors demonstrated high efficiency (>96%) and maintained performance despite fluence up to 2.6×10¹⁶ n_{eq}/cm².

Conclusion: The sensors successfully met CMS's requirements for high-luminosity upgrades.

Abstract: The high-luminosity upgrade of the CERN LHC requires the replacement of the
CMS tracking detector to cope with the increased radiation fluence while
maintaining its excellent performance. An extensive R\&D program, aiming at
using 3D pixel silicon sensors in the innermost barrel layer of the detector,
has been carried out by CMS in collaboration with the FBK (Trento, Italy) and
CNM (Barcelona, Spain) foundries. The sensors will feature a pixel cell size of
\mbox{$25\times100~\mu m^2$}, with a centrally located electrode connected to
the readout chip. The sensors are read out by the RD53A and CROCv1 chips,
developed in 65~nm CMOS technology by the RD53 Collaboration, a joint effort
between the ATLAS and CMS groups. This paper reports the results achieved in
beam test experiments before and after irradiation, up to a fluence of
approximately \mbox{\SI{2.6e16}{n_{eq}/\cm^{2}}}. Measurements of assemblies
irradiated to a fluence of \mbox{\SI{1e16}{n_{eq}/\cm^{2}}} show a hit
detection efficiency higher than 96\% at normal incidence, with fewer than 2\%
of channels masked, across a bias voltage range greater than \SI{50}{V}. Even
after irradiation to a higher fluence of \mbox{\SI{1.6e16}{n_{eq}/\cm^{2}}},
similar performance is maintained over a bias voltage range of \SI{30}{V},
remaining well within CMS requirements.

Method: 利用近似的方法分析了声子的动态行为，探讨了晶格反演对称性与非线性声子相互作用之间的关系。

Result: 研究表明，在驱动频率接近声子 resonance 的一半时，系统会经历 parametric 不稳定性，导致声子轨迹的不对称和强二次谐波生成。

Conclusion: 该研究通过实验或理论模拟验证了这种动态对称性破坏存在于实际系统中，并提出了一种新的声子非线性效应的调控机制。

Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by
optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The
symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be
accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the
instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry
breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time
averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the
steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: They demonstrated a method to mitigate frequency noise in micromechanical sensors by utilizing dual-mechanical-mode operation on a tensioned thin-film resonator, achieving high stability beyond the linear regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequency noise is a critical issue in practical applications of mechanical resonators, such as sensors. Reducing this noise is imperative for improving their performance and applicability.

Method: They used dual-mechanical-mode operation on a tensioned thin-film resonator. By combining knowledge of the Duffing coefficients with readily available amplitude measurements, they were able to mitigate the amplitude-to-frequency conversion problem caused by large actuation amplitudes causing the resonator to enter the nonlinear (Duffing) regime.

Result: By eliminating correlated single-mode frequency drifts, their approach cleanly observes the amplitude-to-frequency conversion at high drive and successfully reduces it using their method. The result is high-stability operation beyond the linear regime, challenging previous perspectives in the field.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach to improve the long-term stability of mechanical resonators by exploiting dual-mechanical-mode operation, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating frequency noise even in the nonlinear regime.

Abstract: Sensing via a mechanical frequency shift is a powerful measurement tool, and,
therefore, understanding and mitigating frequency noise affecting mechanical
resonators is imperative. Thermomechanical noise fundamentally limits
mechanical frequency stability, and its impact can be reduced with increased
coherent amplitude of mechanical motion. However, large enough actuation places
the resonator in the nonlinear (Duffing) regime, where conversion of amplitude
noise (AM) into frequency noise (FM) can worsen sensor performance. Here, we
present an experimentally straightforward method to evade this amplitude
tradeoff in micromechanical sensors. Combining knowledge of the Duffing
coefficients with readily available amplitude measurements, we avoid AM-FM
conversion. Our approach uses dual-mechanical-mode operation on a tensioned
thin-film resonator to set a baseline thermomechanically-limited stability by
eliminating correlated single-mode frequency drifts. Thus, we cleanly observe
AM-FM conversion at high drive, and reduce it using our method. The resulting
high-stability operation beyond the linear regime contrasts long-standing
perspectives in the field.

Abstract: Recent progress in spintronics within the paradigm of altermagnets (AMs)
opens new avenues for next-generation electronic device design. Here, we
establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order
topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through
effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under
uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a
corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical
strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator
occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we
identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and
Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the
topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic
Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism
and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling
topological spintronics with cornertronics.

Abstract: Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to
two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic
topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary
correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By
combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic
T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a
Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter
interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge
currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even
bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder;
and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit
a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution
simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be
converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains
coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature
of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels
in next-generation quantum-optical devices.

Abstract: Valley Hall effect is fundamental to valleytronics and provides a promising
avenue for advancing information technology. While conventional valley Hall
effect requires the inversion symmetry breaking, the recently proposed
nonlinear valley Hall (NVH) effect removes the symmetry constraint, and broaden
material choices. However, existing studies are limited to nonmagnetic
materials without spin involvement and rely on external strain to break
rotational symmetry. Here, to address these limitations, we design a
magnetically controllable NVH effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, by the
tight-binding model and first-principles calculations. The model calculations
demonstrate nonvanishing NVH conductivities can emerge in pristine hexagonal
lattice without external strain, with the magnitude, sign, and spin
polarization of the conductivities being all dependent on the magnetization
orientation. The effect thus generates various spin-polarized valley Hall
currents, characterized by distinct combinations of current direction and spin
polarization. First-principle results on a ferromagnetic VSi$_2$N$_4$ bilayer
confirm considerable NVH conductivities and their dependence on the
magnetization. The magnetically controllable NVH effect unlocks the potential
of centrosymmetric magnets for valleytronics, and offer opportunities for novel
spintronic and valleytronic devices.

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with its flat bands provides a
rich platform for exploring emergent electronic orders. Similarly, periodically
buckled monolayer graphene has been proposed as a tunable alternative for
realizing flat bands. Here, we investigate the combined effect of buckling and
twisting in bilayer graphene. We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG
initially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for
sufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This
occurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the
in-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point
resulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that
buckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening.
While the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice
polarization, the latter prefers to preserve it. This prevents buckling from
generating even flatter bands at the magic angle. Nevertheless, we find that
buckled TBG can exhibit flatter bands than pristine TBG over a wide range of
twist angles, with a flatness similar to that of pristine magic-angle TBG.

Abstract: Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device
variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in
semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is
charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes
unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential
properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic
confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize
and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling
of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of
devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results
in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial
data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component
Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder
affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show
that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a
few principal axes - i.e.there are significant correlations between many
properties of the devices.
  We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate
voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides
a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin
qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic
disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum
dots.

Motivation: Understanding superconductivity in two-dimensional materials is crucial for advancing our knowledge of unconventional superconductors and their applications in quantum devices.

Method: The QTM measures the superconducting spectral function along defined momentum trajectories in a planar tunneling device where a graphene tip is rotated relative to a two-dimensional sample. The method uses three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels to detect rotational symmetry breaking and nodal points in the superconducting order parameter.

Result: The framework successfully probes the pairing symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in the Bistritzer-MacDonald model and the Topological Heavy Fermion model.

Conclusion: The QTM provides a direct and powerful tool for studying the pairing symmetry and origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional materials, with potential applications in both fundamental physics and quantum device development.

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for probing superconductivity with
momentum resolution using the quantum twisting microscope (QTM), a planar
tunneling device where a graphene tip is rotated relative to a two-dimensional
sample. Due to in-plane momentum conservation, the QTM directly measures the
superconducting spectral function along well-defined trajectories in momentum
space. The relative intensities of electron and hole excitations encode the
Bogoliubov coherence factors, revealing the momentum dependence of the pairing
magnitude. Three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels enable direct detection of
rotational symmetry breaking, as well as nodal points in the superconducting
order parameter. We apply our framework to superconductivity within the
Bistritzer-MacDonald model of noninteracting electrons and the Topological
Heavy Fermion model, which accounts for electron-electron interactions.
Together, these capabilities establish the QTM as a direct probe of the pairing
symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional
materials.

Motivation: The isolation of 2D magnetic materials like CrSBr is significant due to potential applications in spintronics, and this paper explores their optical response under strain.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the linear conductivity tensor's diagonal components for different strain configurations.

Result: The study reveals how strain affects excitonic peaks and the overall shape of the diagonal conductivity components, providing insights into the interplay between magnetism and optical excitations in strained 2D materials.

Conclusion: This research broadens our understanding of how structural strain influences the optical and magnetic properties of 2D materials, which is crucial for advancing material science and applications like spintronics.

Abstract: Recently, the isolation of 2D magnetic materials has opened several avenues
for possible new ap- plications in spintronics. Among these materials, CrSBr
has sparked interest due to its relatively high Curie temperature, highly
anisotropic lattice structure, and high structural stability. These properties
ran along others shared by any atomically thin material such as its outstanding
defor- mation capacity and a strong optical response dominated by excitonic
effects. The combination of these properties provides a fairly uncharted
playground where to explore the interplay between magnetism and optical
excitations. Here, we focus our attention on the theoretical optical response
of CrSBr under several distinct strain configurations, analyzing the resulting
changes to both the excitonic peaks and overall shape of the diagonal
components of the linear conductivity tensor.

Motivation: To understand the optical characteristics of graphene quantum dots and their interaction with light.

Result: The computed spectra closely match experimental data, enhancing our understanding of realistic 2D material treatments.

Conclusion: This work provides a robust framework for studying light-matter interactions in graphene quantum dots.

Abstract: We propose a model based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum
electrodynamics (QED) to study the dynamical characteristics of graphene
quantum dots (GQDs). We assume the GQD edges are saturated with hydrogen atoms,
effectively making it a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) such as coronene.
By combining the GQD spectrum calculated from a time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with
the dynamical behavior of a QD model derived from QED, we calculate the main
optical characteristics of the GQD, such as its transition frequencies, the
dipole moment associated to each of those transitions, life-time and the
population dynamics of the molecular levels. Owing to the close match between
the calculated spectrum and experimental results, our results represent a
significant contribution to research on quantum treatments of light-matter
interactions in realistic 2D nanomaterials.

Abstract: We construct a new family of type IIB supergravity solutions corresponding to
states of the D1-D5-P-KKm system that carry the same charges and energy as the
non-extremal four-charge black hole and are asymptotic to AdS$_3 \times
($S$^3/\mathbb{Z}_{N_k}) \times$ T$^4$. The solutions consist of static
binaries of two extremal D1-D5-P black holes with S$^3$ horizons and charges of
opposite signs, held in equilibrium by a topological bubble supporting $N_k$
units of KKm charge. Although dynamically unstable, the spacetimes remain
smooth on and outside the horizons. The equilibrium condition discretizes the
black hole separation, producing a quantized spectrum labeled by the number of
antibranes and antimomenta at the anti-BPS center. Strikingly, the
lowest-energy states lie within an energy window smaller than the dual CFT mass
gap. We also show that these solutions admit regular finite-temperature
deformations, which slightly lift the two black holes above extremality while
remaining within the gap. These results challenge the expectation that no
states exist within the CFT gap, realizing Impossible States. We discuss two
possible resolutions. First, higher-genus corrections to the two-dimensional
effective super-JT theory may allow a sparse spectrum of exponentially
suppressed states within the gap. Alternatively, quantum corrections could lift
these solutions above the gap.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: String theory compactifications come with numerous $U(1)$ factors, implying
the presence of many hidden photons in the low-energy EFT. One may call this
the ``string photoverse''. We argue that, generically, these hidden photons are
massless and do not couple to any light dark current such that, naively,
kinetic mixing with the Standard Model is unobservable. The leading
interactions of these ``superhidden'' photons are then dimension-6 dipole
operators which couple them to quarks or leptons and the Higgs field. This
induces magnetic and electric dipole moments with respect to both the
superhidden photons as well as, through kinetic mixing, to the Standard Model
photon. We derive these couplings by dimensionally reducing the fermionic
action of 7-branes realizing the Standard Model: In the first step to 6d
theories on intersection curves and then, in the presence of fluxes, to our 4d
chiral EFT. We analyze how experiments and observations can employ this effect
to place lower bounds on the string scale, which is relevant for
compactifications with very large volumes. Finally, we briefly discuss how
supersymmetry implies the presence of relatively light photinos and hence an
accompanying ``photinoverse'', which may be observed via renormalizable mixing
effects.

Abstract: We study the cosmology of axion-scalar pairs, coupled by a hyperbolic
field-space metric and with a string-motivated rational scalar potential.
Borrowing tools from the theory of dynamical systems, we are able to classify
all late-time trajectories and extract physical properties of the asymptotic
solutions. These results suggest a Dynamical Distance Conjecture: along the
physical (possibly non-geodesic) trajectories, towers of states become
exponentially light as a function of the traversed field-space distance. We
further rule out possible counterexamples with wildly oscillating solutions.
The considered axion-scalar systems are realized in F-theory compactifications,
where the axion-scalar pair is a complex-structure modulus and four-form fluxes
induce the asymptotic potentials. We also provide a complete Hodge-theoretic
classification of all one-modulus asymptotic potentials of this type.

to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with
rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The
one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near
extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal
background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon
extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping
factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types,
with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being
$(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near
horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the
gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with
charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where
the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term
to the near extremal black hole entropy.

Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional
black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four
different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$
supergravity coupled to \emph{three} vector multiplets with a specific
pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge
parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static
black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the
solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{two}
vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the
model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static
three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their
thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case
without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities
perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of
thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with
squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.

Abstract: The effect of disorder on the Schwinger effect at finite chemical potential
has been studied from holography. The gravitational background with
translational symmetry breaking, characterized by two parameters: the disorder
strength \(\alpha\) and the chemical potential \(\mu\). By employing the
potential analysis method, we derive the total potential that governs the pair
creation process and examine its dependence on \(\alpha\), \(\mu\), and the the
external electric field to its critical value ratio. We analyze the system both
in the absence and in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our results
show that increasing the chemical potential \(\mu\) lowers the potential
barrier, thereby enhancing vacuum instability and facilitating pair production,
while the disorder parameter \(\alpha\) acts oppositely, suppressing the
Schwinger effect by strengthening the barrier. Furthermore, we find that an
external magnetic field plays a role similar to the chemical potential by
reducing the barrier height and promoting pair creation, even in the
subcritical regime. The combined analysis highlights the competing influences
of \(\mu\) and \(\alpha\), and the amplifying effect of the magnetic field, on
the non-perturbative pair production mechanism in holographic setups with
broken translational symmetry.

### [127] [On the Imaginary Part of the Effective Action in de Sitter Spacetime with Different Regularization Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13712)
*Yu Zhou,Hai-qing Zhang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The imaginary part of the effective action helps determine vacuum instability and particle production in de Sitter spacetime. The Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method are typically used but yield different results. By introducing explicit cutoffs in the Green's function approach, it was found that the discrepancy arises from the limiting procedure used. This shows that the two methods are different regularization limits of the same expression, clarifying their disagreement.

Motivation: Understanding the relationship between different methods for calculating the effective action is important for accurately modeling particle production in cosmological settings like de Sitter spacetime.

Method: I analyze the abstract by identifying key concepts and their relationships, focusing on the methods and their results.

Result: The two methods differ due to their distinct regularization procedures, which can now be understood as different limits of the same underlying expression.

Conclusion: This clarification helps in choosing the appropriate method depending on the specific regularization procedure needed for different scenarios.

Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and
particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are
commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function
method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime
they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit
time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the
effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different
limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result
and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are
understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which
clarifies the origin of their disagreement.
