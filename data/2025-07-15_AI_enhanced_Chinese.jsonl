A technical advantage\nof MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si\nsubstrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,\nwhich enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel\nbarrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO\ninterface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling\nelectrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness\n(tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness\ncombinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm.\nSince this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch\nin semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple\nphenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths,\nwhich have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths.\nOur numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin\npolarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments,\nindicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the\nlower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins\nfor this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms.

First, an accurate small-signal model is derived via a\nSwitching-Synchronized Sampled State-Space (5S) framework, yielding\ndiscrete-time transfer functions and root-locus insights for direct digital\ndesign. A critical concern for SCB converters is series-capacitor oscillation\nduring heavy load steps if the strict switching sequence is not maintained. To\naccelerate large-signal transients, a time-optimal control strategy based on\nPontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP) relaxes the switching constraints to\ncompute time-optimal switching sequences. A transition logic is then proposed\nto integrate the high-bandwidth small-signal controller and the large-signal\ncontroller. Simulations demonstrate a rapid output voltage recovery under a\nheavy load step-up, over ten times faster than a linear controller-only design.\nPreliminary hardware tests indicate a stable rejection to heavy load\ndisturbances with zero steady-state error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684SCB\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3VRM\u5728AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u529f\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8377\u9aa4\u53d8\u65f6\u53ef\u4f7f\u7535\u538b\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u4e3a\u539f\u6765\u7684\u5341\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8377\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7a33\u6001\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7684VRM\u5fc5\u987b\u5728AI\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6709\u529f\u529f\u7387\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347VRM\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc75S\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5c0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u4f20\u9012\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6839\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b57\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9SCB\u53d8\u6d41\u5668\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u7535\u5bb9\u632f\u8361\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePontryagins Maximum Principle\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u677e\u5f1b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5f00\u5173\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5f00\u5173\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u6e21\u903b\u8f91\u5c06\u5c0f\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u548c\u5927\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8377\u8df3\u8dc3\u4e0a\u5347\u65f6\uff0c\u7535\u538b\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u72ec\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5feb\u4e86\u5341\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cd\u8d1f\u8377\u6270\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u96f6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VRM\u5728\u91cd\u8d1f\u8377\u7a81\u53d8\u4e0b\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u8282\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Here we introduce a geometric method to quantify\narbitrary states in a 4D Hilbert space by interferometrically mapping them to\nunified centroid ellipses. Specifically, nine Stokes parameters can be deduced\nfrom three ellipses to quantify the 4D spin-orbit states described by SU(4)\nPoincar\\'e hypersphere. We verify its feasibility by detecting these spin-orbit\nstates gotten by both free-space wave plates and few-mode fibers. For the first\ntime, we completely quantify and reconstruct higher-order modal group evolution\nof a weakly guiding few-mode fiber under twist perturbation.

Lowering atomic temperature\ndecreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the\nexcitation laser.

It is\nalso apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate\nwith the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of\niron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface\ntemperatures of 200 K.

A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle\narises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is\nperpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly\nefficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in\nspintronic devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96a7\u9053\u6001\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u666e\u901a\u91d1\u5c5e/ p-\u6ce2\u78c1\u4f53/superconductor \u8f6c\u6362\u5c42\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Andreev\u53cd\u5c04\u81ea\u65cb\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eaf\u6a2a\u5411\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u7535\u8377\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u89d2\u6697\u793a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "This paper introduces a theoretical proposal for a novel topological effect in superconducting junctions, which could have implications for spintronics and electronic devices\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86nonequilibrium Green's function\u6765\u63a8\u5bfc\u81ea\u65cb\u970d\u5c14\u5bfc\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5bfc\u6563\u5305\u62ec\u5f52\u5c5e\u6750\u6599\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b0\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical\nsignatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable\nquantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly\ncorrelated materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86Kitaev\u8702\u871ccomb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u79ef\u5206Heisenberg\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d7\u5230\u6291\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "Kitaev\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c hosts\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u6001\u548c\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u4efb\u4f55\u5b50\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9645\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6b21\u7ea7\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u5b50\u9677\u9631\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u548c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165Heisenberg\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u8702\u871ccomb\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u6001\u51c6\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u76f8\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u73af\u5f62\u8fb9\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u975e\u96f6Chern\u6570\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u7c73\u5e72\u90e8\u961f\u4f0d\u76f8\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5f31\u7684Heisenberg\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u73af\u5f62\u8fb9\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u7684\u6291\u5236\u4e86\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u7834\u574f\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u975e\u79ef\u5206Heisenberg\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684Kitaev-Heisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8f83\u5f31\u65f6\uff0c\u73af\u5f62\u8fb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f97\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u88ab\u538b\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u662f\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u6251_order\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u5fd7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a QU.hopf\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The method consists in\nnested factorizations of the gauge group volume for the determination of the\nconsistently defined delta function of reduced gauge conditions, group\nintegration measure and gauge-fixed contribution of ghosts. It is compared to\nthe Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism of quantizing theories with linearly\ndependent generators and shown to be equivalent to it for first stage reducible\ntheories. Nevertheless, the method under consideration, unlike the BV\nformalism, from the very beginning leads to the functional integral with fewer\nnumber of ghosts. Using this method we quantized the variant of fermionic\ntotally antisymmetric tensor-spinor theory in AdS space and derived its\neffective action in terms of the functional determinants of special Dirac-type\noperators.

However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in\nnoncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation\nat the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is\ndescribed by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by\npopulation -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our\nquantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors\ncreates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins\nin canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between\nmagnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon\ncorrelation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes\ndephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are\nenhanced by magnetic fields.

Our findings open a pathway for identifying\nmultipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy\nas a sensitive and versatile probe.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u73af\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\uff08DCRS\uff09\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6781\u6709\u5e8f\u76f8\u7684\u76f8\u5076\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5076\u548c\u5947\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u591a\u6781\u76f8\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u52a8\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u955c\u9762\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u548c\u9006\u5149\u8c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u6781\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u53cd\u6f14\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u73af\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u5b9e\u73b0\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6781\u76f8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6781\u6709\u5e8f\u76f8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e38\u89c4 stimuli\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u627e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u73af\u504f\u632f\u5149\u6563\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u8868\u660e\u5076\u548c\u5947\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u591a\u6781\u76f8\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u52a8\u6765\u81ea\u955c\u9762\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u548c\u9006\u5149\u8c31\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7DCRS\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e14\u7075\u654f\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u6781\u76f8\u3002"}}

These systems analyse vehicle\nvibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events.\nHowever, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of\nnon-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by\npresence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds\ndo not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple\nvehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles\non travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion.\nThus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar\nlocation, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This\npaper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane\nabnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections.\nWe first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and\nestimate the vehicle path.

Deciphering\ntheir quantum dynamics in space and time calls for high-resolution microscopy\nat this speed. While scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) driven with terahertz\npulses has visualized sub-picosecond motion of single atoms, the advent of\nattosecond light pulses has provided access to the much faster electron\ndynamics. Yet, combining direct atomic spatial and attosecond temporal\nresolution remained challenging. Here, we reveal atomic-scale quantum motion of\nsingle electrons in attosecond lightwave-driven STM. Near-infrared single-cycle\nwaveforms from phase-controlled optical pulse synthesis steer and clock\nelectron tunnelling. By keeping the thermal load of the tip-sample junction\nstable, thereby eliminating thermal artifacts, we detect waveform-dependent\ncurrents on sub-cycle time scales. Our joint theory-experiment campaign shows\nthat single-cycle near-infrared pulses can drive isolated electronic wave\npackets shorter than 1 fs. The angstrom-scale decay of the tunnelling current\nearmarks a fascinating interplay of multi-photon and field-driven dynamics. By\nbalancing these effects, we sharply image a single copper adatom on a silver\nsurface with lightwave-driven currents.

Ensemble-IR enables quantum systems to load an\nentire family of circuits onto a device as a single concise file, allowing\ncontained circuits to instead be recreated on-the-fly at runtime. We\ndemonstrate Ensemble-IR across 18 real-world workloads from prior literature,\nhighlighting its widespread utility for scalable quantum system development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEnsemble-IR\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u8fbe\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u679a\u4e3e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u800cEnsemble-IR\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u52a0\u8f7d\u591a\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5982Qiskit\u3001QIR\u7b49\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u65f6\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528Ensemble-IR\u6355\u6349\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5171\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u7535\u8def\u679a\u4e3e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEnsemble-IR\u5728\u89e3\u51b318\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Ensemble-IR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate\nhybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to\nsystematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits\n(VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over\na fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models,\nwhich incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator,\nconsistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable\nquantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In\nparticular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas\nthose in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence,\nultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs.

The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly\nfall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar\nGravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,\nmaking it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass\nIMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range\nof ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band\nobservations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the\nEinstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.\nWe consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two\npopulation models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform\ndistribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their\ncombination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.\nOur results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for\nhigh-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH\nbinaries with primary masses above $5 \\times 10^4~M_\\odot$ is largely\ninsensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more\nsuited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\\odot$.\nThe multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection\ncapabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the\nmulti-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH\npopulation distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band\nobservations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for\nIMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this\nimportant yet still poorly observed class of black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5730\u6708\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5730\u57fa\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u534f\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9891\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u5730\u6708\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5730\u57fa\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u4fe1\u53f7-to-noise\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5730\u6708\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6355\u83b7\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5730\u57fa\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5219\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u534f\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u603b\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u9891\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

For qubit-based devices, where native gates\nare typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition\ntechniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for\ndecomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in\naccount. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,\nwe develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we\nintroduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor\nproduct of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into\nsingle- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries\ngenerated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).\nSince both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with\nidentity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result\nalso to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit\nrotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the\nlayers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based\nimplementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited\nto qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach\nyields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based\nimplementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also\nrequiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the\nrouting challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited\nconnectivity of the devices.

We then check how these\ncorrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical\nbackreaction and in order to put our result in a context, we compare it to the\ncorresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant\nderived in [1].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728de Sitter\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4f1a\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u70ed\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u70ed\u5a01\u65af\u6ed5\u66fc\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u5206\u5272\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u70ed\u80fd\u52a8\u5f20\u91cf\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u548c2-loop\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9 cosmological\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5728\u8f83\u70ed\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e de Sitter \u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86Bunch-Davies \u771f\u7a7a\u3001\u70ed\u573a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u70b9\u5206\u5272\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0ede Sitter \u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u56de\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u70ed\u5a01\u65af\u6ed5\u66fc\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5904\u7406\u540e\u7684\u70ed\u80fd\u52a8\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bf9 cosmological \u5e38\u6570\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u6709\u65b0\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}
