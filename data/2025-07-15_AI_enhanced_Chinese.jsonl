Using MCMC methods and combining\n$31$ cosmic chronometer data points, $15$ BAO, DESI DR2 BAO and $1701$\nPantheon+ samples, we constrain the model parameters and obtain\n$H_{0}=74.284^{+4.155}_{-4.275}$, $\\Omega_{m0}=0.326^{+0.093}_{-0.072}$ and\n$B=-0.001^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$. The model predicts a transition redshift\n$z_{tr}=0.5914$ and a present deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.5167$, consistent\nwith a Universe transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. We further\nanalyze the evolution of the EoS parameter, density components and statefinder\ndiagnostics in which all parameters show asymptotic convergence to a de Sitter\nphase.

However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in\nnoncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation\nat the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is\ndescribed by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by\npopulation -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our\nquantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors\ncreates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins\nin canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between\nmagnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon\ncorrelation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes\ndephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are\nenhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause\nextrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin\ntransport.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\u6297iferromagnetic\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\uff0c\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u9879\uff08\u5373\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u9879\u8fdb\u884c magon\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u76f8\u90bb\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u53d1\u751f\u81ea\u65cb\u7ffb\u8f6c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5728\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0 magon\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u751f\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u963b\u5c3c\u548c\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u65cb\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u540e\u7aef\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fd8\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u90bb\u8fd1\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u6240\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5916\u6765\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u963b\u5c3c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u70b9\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u5171\u7ebf\u6027\u6750\u6599\u548c\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u78c1\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u5668\u4ef6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u8bba\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u53cd\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u9879\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f20\u9012\u81ea\u65cb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u89d2\u9879\u6d88\u5931\uff1b2. \u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7f3a\u5c11\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\uff1b3. \u5185\u751f\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u963b\u5c3c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b4. \u78c1\u573a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u632f\u8361\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u78c1\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u65cb\u57fa\u5143\u5668\u4ef6\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A\ncommon approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed\nby a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which\nfluoresces.

In this\nstudy, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX\nfluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution\ninto the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site\nsimulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region\nhad a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease\ntowards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was\ncompared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other\nreported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was\ntested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence\n(AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was\nanalysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain\nsample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to\nmaintain moisture and preserve AF.

A technical advantage\nof MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si\nsubstrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,\nwhich enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel\nbarrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO\ninterface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling\nelectrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness\n(tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness\ncombinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm.\nSince this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch\nin semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple\nphenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths,\nwhich have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths.\nOur numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin\npolarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments,\nindicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the\nlower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins\nfor this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms.

Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction\ntopology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse\nshape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that\ndistinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable\nsimulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of\nfirst-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics,\nrequiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to\naccurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic\nPositional U-Net (CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so\nthat they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative\nAdversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this Response Emulation Network (REN)\nlearns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high\nfidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a\nHigh-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact\n(ICPC) geometry to show that CPU-Net effectively captures and reproduces\ncritical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without\ndetector-specific tuning.

To solve the Hubble\nconstant ($H_0$) tension, usually an unknown mechanism is considered that\nshifts the sound horizon at the decoupling era.

In this article we have considered a coupled\nquintessence dark energy model with a special focus on its early-time\nbehaviour. In our solution the initial conditions are naturally decided by\nsetting the value of the sound horizon at the recombination time, $\\theta^*$.\nWe find that during this process, $H_0$ could be derived and its value rises\nwith the coupling strength of the interaction. We also performed the background\nand cosmic microwave background power spectrum analysis, and find that the\nexistence of the interaction term affects the energy density during a narrow\ntime interval range and shifts the early cosmic microwave background spectrum.\nWe also constrained the parameter space of the underlying scenario using the\nmarkov chain monte carlo analysis.

Tight bounds on the complex\neffective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and\noptimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight\nbounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for\nuniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we\nsystematically investigate the attainable range of $\\epsilon_\\perp$ and\n$\\epsilon_\\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with\nisotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and\nconstructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical\nbounds on $\\epsilon_\\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based\non numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of\n$\\epsilon_\\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL\nstructures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we\nquantify the correlation between $\\epsilon_\\perp$ and $\\epsilon_\\parallel$ for\nfixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL\nmicrostructures achieving prescribed values of $\\epsilon_\\perp$. Leveraging the\nCherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent\ntechniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive\ntranslation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor.\nFinally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of\nlow-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in\ntwo-dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u4ecb\u7535\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u6750\u6599\u5728\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4ecb\u7535\u5e38\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u6750\u6599\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ecb\u7535\u5f20\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5728\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Cherkaev-Gibiansky\u53d8\u6362\u548ctranslation method\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ecb\u7535\u5e38\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4ecb\u7535\u5e38\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ecb\u7535\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u4e0e\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u4ecb\u7535\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u548c\u751f\u7269\u6210\u50cf\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u53cc\u7ec4\u5206\u6750\u6599\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, most systems are often studied as a closed\nsystem, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces\ndissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in\nproximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The\nsystem's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we\nconstruct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the\nthird-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which\ncaptures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that\nthe system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and\n$\\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes\n(TZMs) and $\\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the\nsystem.

These systems analyse vehicle\nvibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events.\nHowever, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of\nnon-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by\npresence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds\ndo not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple\nvehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles\non travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion.\nThus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar\nlocation, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This\npaper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane\nabnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections.\nWe first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and\nestimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle\nlane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle\nvibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for\ntwo different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path\ntracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection.

A key challenge\nlies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal\nquantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be\ninsufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as\nsuperconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,\nwe show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,\noccupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of\noff-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of\nthe superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of\nparticle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While\nthis symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it\nallows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal\ncorrelations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u539f\u5b50\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d85\u5bfc\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u5982\u7535\u8377\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u632f\u8361\u3001\u5360\u636e\u6982\u7387\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u8d85\u5bfc\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e8c\u6b21\u76f8\u4f4d\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8d85\u5bfc\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u6269\u5c55 Hubbard \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u586b\u5145\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u51fa\u5355 site \u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u53d8\u4e34\u754c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355 site \u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50- hole \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355 site \u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a\npromising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven\nspin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a\nmetasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin\nstate evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical\nand quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and\ncompute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement.\nOur analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a\nconcurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29\nmicroseconds.

A\nmulti-output quantum teleportation scheme, where a sender (Alice) teleports an\nm and m+1-qubit GHZ-like unknown state to a receiver (Bob), has been\ndemonstrated using two copies of the Bell state instead of a five-qubit cluster\nstate and implemented on IBM's quantum computer for the m=1 case. Another\nscheme, known as quantum broadcasting where a known state is sent to two\nspatially separated parties (Bob and Charlie) has also been realized using two\nBell states. It is shown that existing quantum broadcasting schemes can be\nreduced to multiparty remote state preparation. After achieving teleportation\nof unknown and known states, sending a quantum operator becomes the next step.\nA scheme for remote implementation of operators (RIO), specifically a\ncontrolled joint-RIO (CJRIO), has been proposed using a four-qubit\nhyper-entangled state involving spatial and polarization degrees of freedom. In\nthis direction, two more variants, remote implementation of hidden and\npartially unknown operators (RIHO and RIPUO) have also been proposed. Their\nsuccess probabilities are analyzed considering dissipation of an auxiliary\ncoherent state interacting with the environment. For secure multiparty tasks\nlike quantum voting or auction, secure multiparty quantum computation (SMQC)\nbecomes essential. A quantum anonymous voting (QAV) scheme has been\nexperimentally implemented on IBM's quantum computer. Finally, two quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) protocols, coherent one-way (COW) and differential phase\nshift (DPS), are experimentally demonstrated and the key rates are analyzed as\nfunctions of post-processing parameters and detector dead times across various\ndistances.", "AI": {"tldr":

Deciphering\ntheir quantum dynamics in space and time calls for high-resolution microscopy\nat this speed. While scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) driven with terahertz\npulses has visualized sub-picosecond motion of single atoms, the advent of\nattosecond light pulses has provided access to the much faster electron\ndynamics. Yet, combining direct atomic spatial and attosecond temporal\nresolution remained challenging. Here, we reveal atomic-scale quantum motion of\nsingle electrons in attosecond lightwave-driven STM. Near-infrared single-cycle\nwaveforms from phase-controlled optical pulse synthesis steer and clock\nelectron tunnelling. By keeping the thermal load of the tip-sample junction\nstable, thereby eliminating thermal artifacts, we detect waveform-dependent\ncurrents on sub-cycle time scales. Our joint theory-experiment campaign shows\nthat single-cycle near-infrared pulses can drive isolated electronic wave\npackets shorter than 1 fs. The angstrom-scale decay of the tunnelling current\nearmarks a fascinating interplay of multi-photon and field-driven dynamics. By\nbalancing these effects, we sharply image a single copper adatom on a silver\nsurface with lightwave-driven currents.

We perform a systematic study of these effects in a\ncircuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of\ncurrent and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.\nWhile at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the\nsub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,\nhighly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the\ndetuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the\nnonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the\ncurrent scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the\nrectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or\nnegative.

The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly\nfall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar\nGravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,\nmaking it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass\nIMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range\nof ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band\nobservations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the\nEinstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.\nWe consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two\npopulation models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform\ndistribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their\ncombination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.\nOur results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for\nhigh-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH\nbinaries with primary masses above $5 \\times 10^4~M_\\odot$ is largely\ninsensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more\nsuited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\\odot$.\nThe multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection\ncapabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the\nmulti-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH\npopulation distributions.

The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an\n21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$,\nenabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including\ntwo ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles\nfor the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad\ngradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This\napproach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of\nMaxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial\ncondition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more\nthan 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results\ndemonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full\nquantum state access.

It was found that energy extraction is still\npossible even at a spin parameter of 0.5, which is lower than previous results,\nand the power can be higher than the BZ process in certain regions. In\naddition, we find the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS radius $l$\ncontribute to lowering the spin threshold required for energy extraction. We\nalso study the energy extraction in the plunging region by analyzing the\nallowed regions for energy extraction, and the power as well as efficiency. It\nwas found that the energy extraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25.\nEspecially, we find that parameter $b$ promotes lowering the energy extraction\nspin threshold while $l$ suppresses it, which is different from the circular\norbit case.

For qubit-based devices, where native gates\nare typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition\ntechniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for\ndecomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in\naccount. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,\nwe develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we\nintroduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor\nproduct of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into\nsingle- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries\ngenerated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).\nSince both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with\nidentity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result\nalso to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit\nrotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the\nlayers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based\nimplementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited\nto qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach\nyields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based\nimplementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also\nrequiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a\ngeneralized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the\nnon-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following\ndead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson\nprocesses, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the\nexponential-recovery time constant $\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately\npredicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming\nthe conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the\nimpinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the\nmodel to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model\nsimplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum\nefficiency $\\eta_0$, dead-time $\\tau_\\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant\n$\\tau_\\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be\nachieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally\ngated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key\ndistribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and\nrelated areas.

We investigate the laser beam intensity profile,\nsingle-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying\npolarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the\ntemporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is\nassessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade\ntechnique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre\nemission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order\nautocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$.

A WP clock does not move with a single velocity\nrelative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a\nspread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the\nwave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate\nLorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of\nthe combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and\n\\textit{localized} free particles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u81ea\u7531\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7531\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u5176\u65f6\u949f\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7b26\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u6253\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u5b9a\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e25\u683c\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u81ea\u7531\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u5e26\u6709\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u6c14\u4f53\u6ce2\u5305\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u548c\u65f6\u949f\u884c\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u5b9a\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u65af\u6ce2\u5305\u65f6\u949f\uff08WP\u65f6\u949f\uff09\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u7279\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002"}}

This can\nbe useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we\npresent two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the\nseries to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic\nand quartic term with coupling constant $\\lambda$. The first series is the\nusual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of\n$\\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the\ninteraction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in\ninverse powers of $\\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral,\nwe revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the\noriginal integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a\nseries in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at\nstrong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on\nconvergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time\ninterval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is\nabsolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of\n$\\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and\nwe work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been\nimplemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any\norder $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values\nof $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a\ngiven $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when\n$N\\to \\infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ea7\u6570\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u53d1\u6563\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ea7\u6570\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u5931\u6548\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ea7\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u56db\u6b21\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9879\u5c55\u5f00\u4e3a\u03bb\u7684\u5e42\u6b21\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u4e0d\u5c55\u5f00\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5c06\u56db\u6b21\u9879\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3a\u03bb\u7684\u8d1f\u5e42\u6b21\u5c55\u5f00\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u672c\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Mathematica\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7ea7\u6570\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4f1a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9879\u540e\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u800c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edd\u5bf9\u6536\u655b\u7684\u7ea7\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u6b21\u9879\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u7ea7\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ea7\u6570\u5728\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6240\u5f97\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
