In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing\nspectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is\na segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data\ninto model-agnostic foreground and background contributions. The method takes\nadvantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured\nsimultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational\nindependence of background contributions.

Yet, many biological control mechanisms\nare `simple' -- they restore homeostasis through low-dimensional\nrepresentations of the system's high-dimensional state. How do low-dimensional\ncontrollers maintain homeostasis in high-dimensional systems? We develop an\nanalytically tractable model of integral feedback for complex systems in\nfluctuating environments. We find that selection for homeostasis leads to the\nemergence of a soft mode that provides the dimensionality reduction required\nfor the functioning of simple controllers. Our theory predicts that simple\ncontrollers that buffer environmental perturbations (e.g., stress response\npathways) will also buffer mutational perturbation, an equivalence we test\nusing experimental data across ~5000 strains in the yeast knockout collection.\nWe also predict, counterintuitively, that knocking out a simple controller will\n\\emph{decrease} the dimensionality of the response to environmental change; we\noutline transcriptomics tests to validate this.

However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced\npackaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of\nthe layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables\nthe imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective\nin NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This\nconversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for\nmagnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy\ncurrent effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we\npresent a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample\nscanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.\nThe SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by\naligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect\nusing both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)\nmagnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment\nof the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an\ninversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by\nintegrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM\nimproves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.\nAlso, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a\nreal image.

Finding ways to exert electrical control over spin\ninteractions, with minimal energy dissipation, is a key objective in this\nendeavour.

Remarkably, a spin-polarized supercurrent makes the\ninteraction between magnetic adatoms placed on the surface of a superconductor\ndepend not only on their relative distance, but also on their absolute position\nin space. This property permits electric control over the interaction not only\nbetween two individual spins, but in fact over an entire spin lattice, allowing\nfor non-collinear ground states and a practical arena to study the properties\nof different spin Hamiltonians.

In recent years two\npowerful generalisations of this product -- the lifted and balanced products --\nhave been proposed and employed to great success, but a unified graphical\napproach to describing these codes has been absent.

For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab,\nreflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical\nthickness becomes large. This behavior limits the applicability of conventional\nsingle- and multilayer anti-reflective coatings. Recently, inspired by the\ngeneralized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as\nmetasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a\ndielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only\nin the case of small optical slab thickness. In this work, we study plane wave\ntransmission through dielectric slabs with arbitrary thickness coated from both\nsides by identical metasurfaces with nonlocal response, whose grid impedance is\nangularly dependent (spatially dispersive). Nonlocality is shown to play a key\nrole in obtaining wide-angle reflection suppression in the case of optically\nthick slabs. To validate our approach, we study a metasurface realization\ncomposed of Interconnected Split-Ring Resonators that approximates the\npredicted spatial dispersion law.

In the quantum setting, recent works have\nobtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For\ninstance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a\nquantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum\nprograms represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum\nprograms with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.\n  In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first\nquantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum\nprograms supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.\nAt the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional\nquantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific\nfunctions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security,\nand a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective\nlinear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive\nClifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements."}

The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the\nphysical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum\nconservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate\nset used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit\nconnectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses\nneither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its\ndepth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation\nthat can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on\ntwo benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,\ndemonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow\nrecirculation."}
