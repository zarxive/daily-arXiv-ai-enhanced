It is shown that helical multifrequency undulators can\nbe employed as a bright and versatile source of photons in the states that are\nsuperpositions of the modes with definite projection of total angular momentum\n(TAM), amplitude, and relative phase. All these parameters of the state are\nreadily controlled by the undulator design. The explicit expression for the\namplitude of radiation of a twisted photon from a charged particle in the\nmultifrequency undulator is derived. The energy spectrum of radiation and the\nselection rules for the TAM projection of radiated photons are described. The\nsymmetry properties of the spectrum with respect to the TAM projection are\nestablished. The interpretation to the energy spectrum and to the selection\nrules is given in terms of virtual photons mediating between the charged\nparticle and the undulator.

Here, we demonstrate that the PS-LL model can be used to\nperform magnonic simulations with a single convolution kernel derived from\nanalytical solutions. We demonstrate a twofold increase in computational speed\ncompared with the full dipole calculation. This approach is valid insofar as\nthe excitations are linear, which is typically the case for magnons. Our\nresults have the potential to accelerate magnonic research, particularly for\nthe inverse design method, where several simulations must be performed to\nachieve the desired outcome.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\uff1a\u4f2a\u8c31Landau-Lifshitz\u6a21\u578b\uff08PS-LL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5377\u79ef\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u63cf\u8ff0\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u78c1\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f51\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u539f\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5185\u6838\u3002\u5728\u78c1\u5b50ics\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u78c1\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u5e38\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5377\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528PS-LL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u78c1\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u662f\u539f\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u78c1\u5b50\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u8c31Landau-Lifshitz\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u78c1\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u78c1\u5b50\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u78c1\u573a\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f2a\u8c31Landau-Lifshitz\u6a21\u578b\uff08PS-LL\uff09\u7684\u5185\u6838\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u5185\u6838\u4ee3\u66ff\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "PS-LL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u5185\u6838\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u539f\u6765\u5feb\u4e00\u500d\u591a\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u78c1\u5b50ics\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u8c31Landau-Lifshitz\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u5185\u6838\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u78c1\u5b50ics\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u901f\u5ea6\u5927\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u78c1\u5b50\u9006\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u78c1\u5b50ics\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In 2024, beam time was\nobtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the\nfeasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX\ndetector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were\nattached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets\nof measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the\n157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the\nsubsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region\nbetween 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The\npeaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in\nthe ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of\ncounts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at\nthe center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched\n157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to\nnatural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 %\nincrease in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %)\nand previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background\ndetection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this\ndeviation.

We then derive the\nexpression of $D$ when the interaction potentials are weak, using the Born's\nexpansion.

However, because energy dissipation is typically\nintroduced phenomenologically, its validity for describing nonequilibrium\nprocesses and long-time dynamics in real materials remains questionable. In\nthis paper, we derive a generalized stochastic LLG equation from first\nprinciples for spin-orbital coupled Mott insulators, explicitly incorporating\nthe coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and lattice vibrations. Our\napproach is based on the path-integral formalism formulated along the Keldysh\ncontour, which naturally accounts for dissipation and thermal fluctuations\nthrough interactions with a phonon bath and emergent stochastic noise. We\nbenchmark our theoretical framework by numerically integrating the equations of\nmotion for a two-orbital spin chain coupled to Einstein phonons. The resulting\nenergy relaxation mimics realistic cooling dynamics, exhibits nontrivial\ntransient behavior during thermalization, and accurately reproduces\nthermodynamic properties upon equilibration.

Gravitational radiation damping will\nsubsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral\ntime of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit,\nwith a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the\nmHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus\non extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave\ndetectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called \"peeps\". Peeps are\nnot likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to\nconsider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do\ngenerate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To\naccount for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along\nwith tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using\nthe Illustris Project.

In particular, the energetically most stable configuration provides\nvaluable insight into adsorption-related processes. However, the search for\nthis configuration is a global optimization problem with exponentially growing\ncomplexity as the number of adsorbates and possible adsorption sites increases.\nTo address this, we express the adsorption energy as a sum of multi-adsorbate\ninteraction terms, evaluated using our in-house trained machine learning\ninteratomic potential MACE-Osaka24, and formulate the search for the most\nstable configuration as a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO)\nproblem. We employ a tensor-train-based method, Tensor Train Optimizer (TTOpt),\nto solve the HUBO problem and identify optimal adsorption configurations of CO\nand NO molecules on various alloys up to full surface coverage. Our results\nshow that including interaction terms up to third order may be sufficient to\napproximate adsorption energies within chemical accuracy and to identify\noptimal configurations.

A unified\ngrowth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations\nor specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as\ndoes an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis\ndynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not\nprescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to\ngrowth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the\nexistence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in\nstress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose\na theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and\nmorphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In\nparticular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for\nthe growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution\nlaws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass\ntransport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric\nsynergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living\nmatter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy\nand, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully\ncoupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological\ninteractions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate\ncomplex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a\nContinuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take\na step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological\nproblems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and\nshapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5f62\u6001\u8d8b\u6b63\u548c\u751f\u957f remodel\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u5e94\u529b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u751f\u957f\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u7269\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u751f\u957f\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u751f\u957f\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u8fc7\u591a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u6bdb\u7ec6\u8840\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u751f\u957f\u3001\u518d\u6784\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5f62\u8bba\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u957f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u957f-\u529b\u5b66-\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8868\u9762\u5f20\u529b\u3001\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u751f\u957f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4ea4\u7ec7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u53d1\u80b2\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u957f\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u751f\u957f remodel\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This study provides a straightforward method that paves\nthe way for future minority carrier lifetime tests of semiconductor materials,\nwhich hold great potential for developing the nondestructive tests(NDT) in\nsemiconductor industry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u884d\u751f\u7269\u4ea4\u66ff\u8017\u5c3d\u7684\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u6781\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528 offsunction\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef/\u6c34/\u7845\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7845 Minority Carrier Lifetime (MCL) \u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u7684MCL\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u754c\u9762\u5904\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6781\u5316\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5f71\u54cdMCL\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684MCL\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5bc6\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528 offsunction\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef/\u6c34/\u7845\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u81f4\u548c\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u6781\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7845\u7684MCL\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a offsunction\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef/\u6c34/\u7845\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u6c34/\u7845\u548c\u6c34/\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u754c\u9762\u5904\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6781\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5904\u7684\u5149\u81f4\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u6570\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u7845\u7684MCL\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u5728\u63aa\u65bd\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe98.8%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u7684MCL\uff0c\u6c34\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u8d77\u5230\u4e86\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u7684Minority Carrier Lifetime\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef/\u6c34/\u7845 offsunction\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u6001\u6781\u5316\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5149\u81f4\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9MCL\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface\nBloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann\ndata. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients\nas a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model\nof the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,\nand ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue\nproblem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a\ngeometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the\nsurface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber\nnormal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber\nin the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is\nderived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths\nare obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the\nQEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both\ndispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a\nlow-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration\nof the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of\nthe SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. For completeness, our\nanalysis includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface\nBloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary\nlayers.", "AI": {"tldr": "The study investigates surface Bloch (SB) waves in periodic media, focusing on their dispersion, waveform, and skin depth using a quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) approach.

Here we investigate the effect of a perpendicular\ninterlayer bias on electron tunneling through electrostatic barriers in TBLG.\nUsing a dual-gated model, which controls the carrier density and interlayer\npotential difference independently, we compute the transmission and reflection\nprobabilities of electrons at different angles and energies for representative\ntwist angles of $\\theta = 1.8^{\\circ}$, $3.89^{\\circ}$, and $9.43^{\\circ}$.

Our results show this leads to near-total\nreflection at low energy, with transmission starting to increase just above the\ngap due to twist-dependent conducting channels.

We first evaluate the\npotential gain of ideal IC-NLC in 4 THz systems by estimating the proportion of\nself-channel interference (SCI) using the split-step Fourier method (SSFM)\nbased simulation with either lumped amplification or distributed amplification.\nAs the symbol rate increases to 300 GBaud, the SCI proportion exceeds 65%. On\nthe other hand, the non-deterministic polarization mode dispersion (PMD) will\nimpact the effectiveness of IC-NLC, especially for ultra-high symbol rate\nsystems. Therefore, we investigate the power spectral density of the residual\nnonlinear noise after ideal IC-NLC in the presence of PMD. The results indicate\nthat the gain of ideal digital backpropagation (IDBP) decreases by 3.85 dB in\n300 GBaud erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)-amplified links with a PMD\nparameter of 0.05 ps/km1/2, and 5.09 dB in distributed Raman amplifier\n(DRA)-amplified links. Finally, we evaluate the potential gains of practical\nIC-NLC in C-band wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems by employing\nthe low-pass-filter assisted digital backpropagation (LDBP). As the symbol rate\nincreases from 100 GBaud to 300 GBaud, the gain of 20-step-per-span (20-stps)\nLDBP increases from 0.53 dB to 0.87 dB for EDFA-amplified links, and from 0.89\ndB to 1.30 dB for DRA-amplified links.

The reported refractometric method provides a simple\nand promising means for characterizing the dispersion properties of a wide\nrange of materials, including gels, solids, and liquids, also opening new\npossibilities for the development of new refractive index sensing platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76-filled capillary fibers\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6297\u5171\u632f\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7684\u6d4b\u5b9a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eagarose\u51dd\u80f6\uff0c\u5206\u6790600-900nm\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u51dd\u80f6\u4e2d\u6c34\u548c\u7518\u6cb9\u6d53\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ea7Sellmeier\u7cfb\u6570\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u8f93\u5149\u8c31\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u805a\u5408\u7269\u51dd\u80f6\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u53d1\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5728capillary fibers\u4e2d\u586b\u5145\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6297\u5171\u632f\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4f20\u8f93\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8 attenuated \u4ea4\u66ff\u533a\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5149\u8c31\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d0\u53d6\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728600-900 nm\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u8f93\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u6ce2\u957f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u6c34\u548c\u7518\u6cb9\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0bagarose\u51dd\u80f6\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6c42\u5f97\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ea7\u7684Sellmeier\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u8868\u5f81\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u805a\u5408\u7269\u51dd\u80f6\u3001\u56fa\u4f53\u548c\u6db2\u4f53\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u4f20\u611f\u5e73\u53f0\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this contribution, we introduce the\nquantum molecular structure encoding (QMSE) scheme, which encodes the molecular\nbond orders and interatomic couplings expressed as a hybrid Coulomb-adjacency\nmatrix, directly as one- and two-qubit rotations within parameterised circuits.\nWe show that this strategy provides an efficient and interpretable method in\nimproving state separability between encoded molecules compared to other\nfingerprint encoding methods, which is especially crucial for the success in\npreparing feature maps in QML workflows. To benchmark our method, we train a\nparameterised ansatz on molecular datasets to perform classification of state\nphases and regression on boiling points, demonstrating the competitive\ntrainability and generalisation capabilities of QMSE. We further prove a\nfidelity-preserving chain-contraction theorem that reuses common substructures\nto cut qubit counts, with an application to long-chain fatty acids.

This remarkably long coherence time is believed\nto result from the intrinsic purity of solid neon as a qubit host. In this\npaper, we present theoretical studies on the decoherence mechanisms of an\nelectron's charge (lateral motional) states on solid neon. At the typical\nexperimental temperature of ~10 mK, the two main decoherence mechanisms are the\nphonon-induced displacement of the neon surface and the phonon-induced\nmodulation of the neon permittivity (dielectric constant). With a qubit\nfrequency increasing from 1 GHz to 10 GHz, the charge coherence time decreases\nfrom about 366 s to 7 ms, and from about 27 s to 0.3 ms, respectively, limited\nby the two mechanisms above. The calculated coherence times are at least one\norder longer than the observed ones at ~6.4 GHz qubit frequency, suggesting\nplenty of room for experimental improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper reports a solid-state electron charge qubit with a coherence time of 0.1 ms on solid neon, which is unusually long.

For both\nmodels, we derive exact solutions by employing Bogoliubov transformations. In\nthe btpQRM, we identify spectral collapse at a critical coupling strength, with\naccompanying $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry breaking that correlates with exceptional\npoints (EPs) arising from coalescing eigenstates. We establish a direct\ncorrespondence between $\\mathcal{PT}$-broken regions and the doubly degenerate\npoints of the Hermitian tpQRM, and analyze the effects of qubit bias via an\nadiabatic approximation. In the dtpQRM, although no spectral collapse occurs,\nboth EPs and Juddian-type degeneracies are present, with well-separated\nbehaviors distinguished by parity conservation. Through biorthogonal fidelity\nsusceptibility and c-product, we successfully identify and classify the nature\nof these two types of level crossings.

However, such binary classifications become inadequate in\ndescribing matrices whose elements vary continuously over time, thereby\ntransitioning through intermediate states near singular configurations. To\naddress this fundamental limitation, we develop a rigorous and original\nmathematical theory termed Continuity Norm Framework for the Evolution of\nNonsingular Matrices. Within this framework, we introduce a novel mathematical\nstructure enabling continuous and differentiable transitions between singular\nand nonsingular matrix states, explicitly governed by a specialized continuity\nnorm and evolution operators derived through a well-defined differential\nformulation.

However, devising explicit block encoding\ncircuits remains a well-recognized and challenging problem. One of the most\nwidely studied and versatile approaches to block encoding is the Linear\nCombination of Unitaries (LCU). Despite its generality, the practical use of\nLCU is often limited by significant gate overhead, primarily stemming from the\nmulti-controlled gates required in the SELECT oracle. We introduce a compact\nLCU formulation, dubbed FOQCS-LCU, which leverages the check matrix formalism\nto implement a constant-depth SELECT oracle using a linear number of singly\ncontrolled Pauli gates and ancillae. We demonstrate that, by exploiting the\nstructure of the problem, the cost of the state preparation oracle can also be\nsubstantially reduced. We accomplish so by designing a parametrized family of\nefficient Dicke state preparation routines. We construct explicit block\nencoding circuits for representative spin models such as the Heisenberg and\nspin glass Hamiltonians and provide detailed, non-asymptotic gate counts. Our\nnumerical benchmarks validate the efficiency of the FOQCS-LCU approach,\nillustrating an order-of-magnitude improvement in CNOT count over conventional\nLCU.
