Nanophotonic platforms like Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) have played a critical role in providing refractometric sensing capabilities for clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring. However, traditional systems operating in a single-polarization state cannot fully characterize complex optical properties such as birefringence, which is crucial to resolve many complex biological interactions. Although Bloch Surface Wave (BSW) sensors can support both TE and TM modes, a key capability SPR lacks, they have historically been implemented in single-mode configurations. In this paper, we present a polarization multiplexed BSW refractometric sensing system, simultaneously tracking the resonant wavelength shifts of both TE and TM BSW modes through time. Our technique was applied to investigate single-strand DNA growth during rolling circle amplification (RCA). To accurately recover the time-dependent birefringence, capturing dynamics of the DNA growth and orientation of its chains, we implemented a two-stage modeling approach based on the TMM. First, we utilized a wavelength-dependent surface sensitivity model, confining refractive index changes to the immediate layer above the crystal, to distinguish isotropic background dynamics from birefringent signals. Following the onset of RCA, we transitioned to a model that accounted for the vertical growth of the DNA layers in time. By fitting this model to the TE and TM resonant shifts, we monitor the growth rate of the single-strand DNA layer as well as the refractive index along the two polarization components. Our findings demonstrate the platform's ability to resolve the structural evolution of complex bimolecular interactions associated with conformational changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u504f\u632f\u6027\u7684 Bloch \u8868\u9762\u6ce2 (BSW) \u6298\u5149\u7387\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4bDNA\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u4e0a\u5bf9TE\u548cTM\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349DNA\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u94fe\u8282\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76DNA\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u751f\u7269\u5316\u5b66\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728DNA\u81a8\u80c0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u6eda\u52a8\u73af\u72b6\u6269\u589e (RCA)\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2aDNA\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u504f\u632f\u6027\u7684BSW\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u6570\u636e\u6355\u83b7TE\u548cTM\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408TE/TM\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6ce2\u957f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u8868\u9762\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651DNA\u5782\u76f4\u751f\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8ddf\u8e2aDNA\u7684\u751f\u957f\u901f\u7387\u548c\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4bDNA\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349DNA\u751f\u957f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728RCA\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u504f\u632f\u6027\u7684BSW\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e2d\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The main challenge with using a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas target is the significantly lower gas gains to which they are typically limited. Recently, a MMThGEM device has been successfully demonstrated as an excellent gain stage device in the NID gas SF$_6$; capable of producing gas gains comparable with the electron drift gas CF$_4$. The next major challenge is to extend this high gain capability to multi-dimensional readout for the purpose of particle track reconstruction. The MMThGEM is therefore ideal for coupling to a strip readout detector like a Micromegas to achieve a high gain multi-dimensional Negative Ion (NI) readout plane, which is potentially suitable for the scale up required by future searches proposed by the CYGNUS consortium. In this paper, the first high gain demonstration of such a MMThGEM-Micromegas detector in low pressure SF$_6$ is described. This includes detector characterisation in a small test vessel resulting in the largest NI gas gain ever reported, 1.22 $\\pm$ 0.08 $\\times$ 10$^5$ , and directionality with alpha particles. Finally, this gain characterisation and tracking capability is leveraged to measure the energy and range of events, and identify those consistent with Nuclear Recoils (NRs), in a large cubic metre scale volume of SF$_6$ for the first time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We establish a spatially periodic population grating in the Rb sample using two laser beams that intersect at a small angle $\u03b8$ of a few milliradians. The atomic population grating decays exponentially in time due to diffusive motion induced by momentum-changing elastic collisions between Rb and buffer gas atoms or molecules, and is monitored by observing the scattered field from a read-out beam. We distinguish the contribution of diffusion from other collisional processes by measuring the characteristic $\u03b8^2$ dependence of the decay rate. We also measure the systematic dependence of the decay rate on the buffer gas pressure over a range of $7\\,000$ Pa to $90\\,000$ Pa. In this manner, we obtain diffusion coefficients at standard atmospheric pressure of $101\\,325$ Pa and at a temperature of 24.0(5)~$^\\circ$C.

This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u91d1\u521a\u70f7-12\u8fb9\u5f62\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5e73\u5e26\uff08FB\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d7\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6676\u683c\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5b8c\u5168\u5e73\u3001\u65e0\u8272\u6563\u5e26\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u51fa\u73b0\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\uff08CLS\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9bCLS\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55 frustration\u89e3\u6790\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8be5FB\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f31\u968f\u673a onsite\u65e0\u5e8f\u6781\u5ea6\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5747\u5300\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u7a7f\u900f\u91d1\u521a\u70f7\u9762\u56e2\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u67d0\u4e9b\u5e26\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u6574\u6570\u7684Chern\u6570\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u591a\u7ec8\u7aef\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u5171\u632f\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6291\u5236\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u5e26\u7269\u7406\u548c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5149\u5b50\u6676\u683c\u548c\u8d85\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bf9\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u5e26\u7269\u7406\u548c\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u611f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u6676\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97Chern\u6570\u3001\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u6001\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002 GOT model \u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6676\u683c\u4ea7\u751f3\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u5e73\u7684\u975e\u8272\u6563\u5e26\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u6001\u3002\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e26\u6709\u975e\u96f6Chern\u6570\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u62d3\u6251\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u88ab\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u591a\u7ec8\u7aef\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982-resonance\u548c-transmission suppression\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5e73\u5e26\u7269\u7406\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5e73\u5e26\u7269\u7406\u3001\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u91d1\u521a\u70f7-12\u8fb9\u5f62\u6676\u683c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Over a wide range of 2DHG densities (from 0.7 $\\times$ 10$^{15}$/m$^2$ to $2 \\times 10^{15}$/m$^2$), Fourier analysis of low-field (B < 1 T) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole (HH) subbands with distinct effective masses contributing to transport. Surprisingly, the lighter-mass HH subband exhibits a parabolic dispersion with Fermi wavevector below the anticrossing between the heavy-hole and light-hole subbands, while the heavier HH subband is non-parabolic throughout. Quantitative comparison with numerical calculations based on the Luttinger model reveals that both effective masses are enhanced by a common factor ($\\approx$ 2.3), which we attribute to many-body interactions. This common scaling factor has a very weak dependence on the 2DHG density, likely due to band hybridization. Our measured hole masses are compared with published cyclotron resonance and magnetotransport values.

Assuming ideal classical communication, the reliability of quantum teleportation is limited by the fidelity of the shared EPR pairs. This reliability can be improved through two mechanisms: entanglement purification and quantum error correction (QEC). Using both techniques in concert requires flexible QEC rates, since purification alters the structure of errors induced by imperfect-EPR teleportation, and fixed-rate codes cannot be uniformly effective across purification regimes or reliability targets. In this work, we supplement purification with punctured QEC codes, providing a family of code variants that can be adapted to error-channel characteristics and reliability targets. Punctured codes improve teleportation reliability across a broader range of purification regimes, enabling target reliability to be met without hardware-level code switching. This is corroborated by numerical results, showing that different punctured codes achieve the lowest logical error probability in different operating regimes, and that selecting among them reduces logical error relative to fixed-rate encoded teleportation. This reduction relaxes the requirement on the initial EPR fidelity or purification needed to achieve a target reliability. Overall, puncturing enables adaptation to varying entanglement conditions and reliability requirements while reusing a single stabilizer structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes using punctured quantum error correction codes to improve teleportation reliability without requiring hardware-level code switching.", "motivation": "Quantum teleportation is a fundamental protocol for quantum communication, and the paper addresses the challenge of maintaining reliability under imperfect EPR pairs by proposing novel error correction methods.", "method": "The authors introduce punctured QEC codes combined with entanglement purification, proving that their approach allows for adaptive error correction across varying purification conditions and reliability targets.", "result": "Numerical results demonstrate that punctured codes perform better than fixed-rate codes in different operating regimes, reducing logical error probabilities and lowering the required initial EPR fidelity and purification levels for target reliability.", "conclusion": "The proposed method simplifies the implementation of adaptive error correction, enhancing the practicality and efficiency of quantum teleportation protocols."}}

We inject the impurity with initial velocities ranging from the subsonic to supersonic regime, and subsequently track its dynamics. For supersonic initial velocities, we observe the formation of a shock wave and a remarkably fast relaxation to a stationary regime, on a time scale that increases with decreasing impurity velocity.

Strongly interacting dipolar excitons in van der Waals heterostructures have attracted significant interest due to their out-of-plane electric dipole moments and high tunability via the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE). However, leveraging these tunable dipolar excitons in strongly coupled exciton-photon systems to explore exotic many-body physics and macroscopic quantum phenomena remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the strong coupling of dipolar excitons in a gated bilayer MoS2 device integrated with a one-dimensional photonic crystal hosting bound-states-in-continuum (BIC). The resulting polaritons hybridize cavity photons with a coherent superposition of two electrically tunable anti-aligned dipolar excitons, effectively binding them into composite quasiparticle states. By tuning the dipolar excitons into non-degenerate states via the QCSE, we realize in situ reconfiguration of the polariton wavefunction and observe an emergent polariton branch exhibiting non-monotonic Stark shifts. Notably, these tunable polaritons allow for customized control over nonlinear interactions through distinct excitonic hybridization and dipolar configurations.

In the weakly chaotic regime, we identify spin-coherent states placed at the edge of the regular islands in the mixed classical phase space as optimal initial states for enhanced sensitivity. On the other hand, in the strongly chaotic regime, $I_\u03b1$ is insensitive to the choice of the initial state.

Vanadium redox flow batteries offer a viable option among other technologies, due to their long lifetime and independently scalable output power and capacity. The electrolyte temperature should be maintained within the range of 5-40 Celsius for safe operation; therefore, a thermal management system is necessary, which affects battery efficiency. The study presents a detailed, containerized battery model with a hybrid thermal management system that considers thermal radiation and real ambient temperatures. A total of 180 configurations were investigated in 10 cases, ranging from 4 to 400 kW, with 18 different discharging current-cell number ratios in each case, including multistack arrangements. Current-dependent ohmic losses influence the electric efficiency, which increases from a minimum of 68% to 89% in low-current configurations. However, the net system efficiency ranges between 43% and 66% due to the self-consumption of pumps, the inverter, and the thermal management system. In addition to the detailed efficiency analysis, a comprehensive investigation of thermal processes is provided in terms of the current-cell number ratio and output power, which is crucial for designing thermal management systems and sizing batteries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u9762\u4e34\u968f\u673a\u52bf\u5934\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u50a8\u80fd\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002vanadium\u7ea2\u6c27\u6d41 batteries\u6709\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6bd4\u5bf9\u7535\u6c60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u529f\u7387\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7535\u7f51\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u50a8\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002vanadium\u7ea2\u6c27\u6d41\u52a8\u50a8\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u7406\u60f3\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u6e29\u63a7\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u70ed\u80fd\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7387\u662f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u548c180\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6bd4\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u548c\u70ed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u7535\u6d41\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u8fbe\u523089%\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u7535\u6d41\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u81ea\u8017\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6bd4\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6548\u7387\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u7535\u6c60\u548c\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u5316\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6c60\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7535\u6d41\u6bd4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u70ed\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u6c60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u603b\u6548\u7387\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5982\u4e8c\u6b21\u7535\u6c60\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u695a\u7ef4 Babyskovitch \u642d\u914d\u3002"}}

For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that the resulting fourth-order equation of motion admits a conformal bi-Hamiltonian formulation, possesses a non-trivial set of Lie symmetries and we demonstrate the existence of bounded and regular trajectories in representative parameter regimes. By establishing an explicit correspondence with an integrable generalised H\u00e9non-Heiles system, we show that the interacting higher-derivative dynamics inherits the integrability properties of the latter. This connection allows us to construct a second conserved Hamiltonian, to clarify the geometric origin of separability, and to obtain explicit classical solutions in terms of elliptic functions.

By exploiting an efficient evaluation of the Hessian-vector product, $k$-CIAH achieves $O(N_k^2 n^3)$ scaling in both CPU time and memory, matching that of previously reported first-order $k$-space approaches while improving upon the $O(N_k^3 n^3)$ scaling of $\u0393$-point CIAH, where $N_k$ denotes the number of $k$-points sampling the first Brillouin zone and $n$ characterizes the unit-cell size. Benchmark calculations on a diverse set of solids -- including insulators, semiconductors, metals, and surfaces -- demonstrate the fast and robust convergence of $k$-CIAH-based PMWF optimization, which yields an overall computational efficiency approximately 2-3 -fold higher than first-order $k$-space methods and orders of magnitude higher than $\u0393$-point CIAH for localizing 1000-5000 orbitals. The quality of the resulting PMWFs is further validated by accurate electronic band structures obtained via PMWF-based Wannier interpolation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b64\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5916\u5fc3\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0ck-CIAH\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5916\u5fc3\u8f68\u9053\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86k-CIAH\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Hessian\u5411\u91cf\u79ef\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0O(Nk\u00b2n\u00b3)\u7684\u6807\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u0393\u70b9CIAH\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u3001\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u548c\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86k-CIAH\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u8f68\u9053\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u0393\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u65482-3\u500d\uff0c\u6bd4\u0393\u70b9CIAH\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "k-CIAH\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5916\u5fc3\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, spin parameters are typically weakly constrained from data, and their inferred values are often strongly influenced by the assumed prior in Bayesian analyses. A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations. Because mass and spin measurements are correlated, our prior also enables a more accurate recovery of the underlying mass distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684BBH\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eXeff\u548cXp\u7684\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7684BBH\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3BBH\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eXeff\u548cXp\u7684\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u65cb\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f7f\u7528Spin Manssing\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We address both issues by developing a principled framework that derives quasi-probabilities and their conditional calculus from structural consistency requirements on how statements are valued across different universes of discourse, understood as finite Boolean algebras of statements.We begin with a universal valuation that assigns definite (possibly complex) values to all statements. The central concept is Syntactic Locality: every universe can be embedded within a larger ambient one, and the universal valuation must behave coherently under such embeddings and restrictions. From a set of structural principles, we prove a representation theorem showing that every admissible valuation can be re-expressed as a finitely additive measure on mutually exclusive statements, mirroring the usual probability sum rule. We call such additive representatives pre-probabilities. This representation is unique up to an additive regraduation freedom. When this freedom can be fixed canonically, pre-probabilities reduce to finite quasi-probabilities, thereby elevating quasi-probability theory from a computational device to a uniquely determined additive representation of universal valuations. Classical finite probabilities arise as the subclass of quasi-probabilities stable under relativisation, i.e., closed under restriction to sub-universes. Finally, the same framework enables us to define a coherent theory of conditionals, yielding a well-defined generalized Bayes' theorem applicable to both pre-probabilities and quasi-probabilities.

In single component bosonic systems, its effect is already present at the critical point for the Bose-Einstein condensate phase transition by shifting it to lower temperatures as a consequence of effective repulsion between the atoms. When considering atomic bosonic mixtures, interesting effects arise from the competition between intra- and interspecies interactions such as the miscible-immiscible phase transition and the particular case of self-bounded quantum droplets. In such a scenario, it is natural to expect that these interactions will also affect the critical point of each species composing the mixture. In this paper, we obtain analytical expressions for the critical temperature shift of the phase transition to a Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of a second species. We treat differently the cases in with the second species is above or below its own critical temperature and apply the obtained relations to the case of a $^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K bosonic mixture which can be realized in current running experimental setups. Our findings can be easily extended to other atomic mixtures trapped by arbitrary conservative traps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u73bb\u8272\u539f\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u4f53\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5230$^{23}$Na-$^{39}$K\u539f\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u539f\u5b50\u6df7\u5408\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u6240\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u7b26\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u4e34\u754c\u6e29\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u3002\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u73bb\u8272\u6df7\u5408\u7269\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, the process is governed by laser-matter interactions where the local fluence determines the processing depth, often limiting control over feature geometry and efficiency. Here, we present a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation (1.8 MeV Au2+ ions) into SiO2 samples with femtosecond laser irradiation (250 fs), effectively tuning the laser-matter interaction and resulting morphology. At both 515 nm and 1030 nm irradiation wavelengths, single-shot femtosecond pulses produce cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat-bottom profiles. Independently of the fluence, these craters exhibit a constant depth of 550 nm, corresponding to the region of maximum Au concentration. The effect manifests already at moderate fluence (app. 4 J/sq.cm) and yields high ablation efficiency, up to 15 cubic micrometers per microjoule. The hybrid method also works effectively at lower implantation doses that preserve the excellent transmission of fused silica, offering a promising pathway for the high-quality fabrication of flat optical components such as binary phase masks, phase lenses, or fused-silica micromolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid femtosecond laser and Au implantation for precise optical component fabrication.", "motivation": "To address the limitation of surface feature control and efficiency in femtosecond laser processing of fused silica, the paper proposes a hybrid approach combining localized Au implantation with femtosecond laser irradiation.", "method": "Hybrid method using femtosecond laser irradiation with 515 nm and 1030 nm wavelengths and Au implantation with 1.8 MeV Au2+ ions at 1 \u03bcm.", "result": "Results show that this combination achieves cylindrical craters with sharp edges and flat bottoms, a constant ablation depth of 550 nm, and high processing efficiency.", "conclusion": "The hybrid method offers a way to improve the quality and efficiency of optical component fabrication while preserving the high transmission properties of fused silica."}}

This method enables efficient extraction of the ion's phonon occupation number following sub-Doppler cooling close to the motional ground state. The proposed method relies on monitoring the cavity probe transmission while scanning the probe laser frequency once cavity EIT is established using the control beam, significantly simplifying the measurement procedure. We theoretically establish a model that demonstrates influence of thermal state of the trapped ion vis a vis the EIT linewidth measured. We show how the cavity EIT transmission may be used as a thermometry tool to deduce the ion temperature as well as the motional state for an ion in the sub-Doppler cooling regime. The current method can only be used for operation in the resolved-sideband regime, where individual motional states can be selectively addressed for all relevant transitions either by selecting appropriate energy levels for the three-level system or by employing strong confinement with high secular frequencies ($\\sim 10 MHz$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8154\u5185\u7535\u78c1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u900f\u660e\u5ea6(EIT)\u6d4b\u91cf\u79bb\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08 cavity-qed\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u6d4b\u63a2\u5668\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u9891\u7387\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u675f\u5efa\u7acb\u7684EIT\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u8fd0\u52a8 ground state\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u79bb\u5b50\u70ed\u6001\u5bf9EIT linewidth\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8154EIT\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\u6d4b\u91cf\u79bb\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u65cb\u8fb9\u5e26\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684 regime\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u5728\u539f\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u79bb\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8154EIT\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7cbe\u5999\u51b7\u5374\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8154\u5185EIT\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6d4b\u63a2\u5668\u626b\u63cf\u9891\u7387\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u675f\u5efa\u7acb\u7684EIT\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u79bb\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u65cb\u8fb9\u5e26\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u70ed\u6001\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u5999\u51b7\u5374\u540e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u79bb\u5b50\u6e29\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Emerging optoelectronic RC platforms,such as light-driven memristors, merge the benefits of electronic and photonic computation. However, conventional designs are often limited by the unipolar photoresponse of optoelectronic devices, which restricts reservoir state diversity and reduces computational accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an all-optically controlled RC system employing an oxide memristor array that demonstrates exceptional uniformity and stability. The memristive devices exhibit wavelength-dependent bipolar photoresponse, originating from light-induced dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies. Tuning the power density and irradiation mode of dual-wavelength light pulses enables dynamic control of photocurrent relaxation and nonlinearity. By leveraging these unique device properties, we develop bipolar and parallel coding strategies to significantly enrich reservoir dynamics and enhance nonlinear mapping capability. In word recognition and time-series prediction tasks, the bipolar coding demonstrates markedly improved accuracy compared to unipolar coding. The parallel coding supports multi-source signal fusion within a single reservoir, maintaining high computational accuracy while significantly reducing hardware consumption.

Considering that the system possesses $C_3$ point group of symmetry, the nonzero components of the conductivity tensor are $\u03c3^{(2);-++}=[\u03c3^{(2);+--}]^\\ast$. Therefore, a pure circularly polarized light generates zero shift current. In the clean limit, the conductivities are nonzero only for discrete photon energies because of the discrete Landau levels and energy conservation, and they become Lorentzian lineshapes with the inclusion of damping, which relaxes the condition of energy conservation. The dependence of the spectra on the damping parameters, the magnetic fields, and the chemical potentials is investigated in detail. Our results reveal that the shift current is highly tunable by the chemical potential and the magnetic field.

To investigate the stability, we systematically analyze ghost, Laplacian, and tachyonic instabilities at the linear perturbative level. The stability conditions are easily satisfied for tensor perturbations, but impose nontrivial constraints on the parameter space for vector perturbations. Furthermore, in the presence of a nonvanishing background vector field, the scalar sector becomes unstable at small wavenumbers $|\\vec{k}|$.

For balanced mixtures, weak intercomponent interactions yield a fourfold momentum-space symmetry dictated by the lattice geometry. Increasing the coupling strength leads to the emergence of additional momentum peaks that combine with the lattice-induced structure to produce an eightfold rotationally symmetric pattern, signaling quasicrystalline order. At intermediate interactions, global phase separation suppresses this quasicrystalline state; however, at stronger coupling, local phase separation gives rise to a long-lived metastable phase in which the eightfold symmetry is restored. In this regime, a secondary ring of dominant momentum peaks appears at smaller wave vectors, indicating longer-wavelength density modulations and a crossover from lattice-dominated to interaction-driven quasicrystalline order. In contrast, imbalanced mixtures form partially miscible density clusters with eightfold-symmetric aperiodic patterns only at intermediate coupling, while stronger interactions drive global phase separation and permanently destroy quasicrystalline order. Real-time simulations demonstrate that these aperiodic structures are dynamically stable and experimentally accessible. Our results show that quasicrystalline order can emerge in binary condensates without explicitly aperiodic lattices and reveal population balance as a key ingredient for stabilizing quantum quasicrystals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations.

In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped N\u00e9el phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_\u03c7$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4(iDMRG)\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6781\u5316\u632f\u5e45\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u4f53\u57fa\u6001\u662f\u5206\u7acb\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u65e0\u5206\u7acb\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb-1/2 XXZ\u94fe\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u533a\u5206\u6c64\u68ee cooled \u6db2\u4f53\uff08\u65e0\u5206\u7acb\u7684\uff09\u548c\u5c3c\u83b1\u65af\u76f8\uff08\u5206\u7acb\u7684\uff09\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb-1/2 XY-J\u03c7 \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u65e0\u5206\u7acb\u7684 XY \u76f8\u5230\u6709\u5206\u7acb\u7684\u8272\u6563\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u76f8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u5206\u7acb\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u662f\u5206\u7acb\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u65e0\u5206\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u4f46\u60ac\u800c\u672a\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4(iDMRG)\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6781\u5316\u632f\u5e45\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u79fb\u7b97\u7b26\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6781\u5316\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u81ea\u65cb-1/2 XXZ\u94fe\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb-1/2 XY-J\u03c7 \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7acb\u8c31\u7279\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6c64\u68ee cooled \u6db2\u4f53\u548c\u5c3c\u83b1\u65af\u76f8\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u5206\u7acb\u7684 XY \u76f8\u4e0e\u6709\u5206\u7acb\u7684\u8272\u6563\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u7acb\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\u3002"}}

Specifically, we derive an exact formula for the conductance up to order $T^2$ in the large superconducting gap limit, which is expressed in terms of the transmission probabilities of Cooper pairs and interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $\u03c9^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u4ea4\u53c9\u5b89\u5fb7\u96f7\u592b\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8d39\u7c73\u6d41\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u548c\u5927\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u95f4\u9699\u6781\u9650\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u3002\u6240\u7528\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u8003\u8651\u4e86 impurity \u7535\u5b50\u7684\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u79e9\u5316\u7ec4(NRG)\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Andreev\u5c42\u6b21\u79fb\u51fa\u8d39\u7c73\u5c42\u6b21\u65f6\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdCooper\u5bf9\u7684\u96a7\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cCooper\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u9879\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7535\u5bfc\u8d21\u732e\u4e0eBogoliubov-\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u53c9\u5b89\u5fb7\u96f7\u592b\u53cd\u5c04\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u548c\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8003\u91cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4f4e\u6e29\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u548c\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u73b0\u8c61\u65f6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u6d41\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e0e\u6b63\u5e38\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u8d39\u7c73\u6d41\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9Anderson\u6742\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u79e9\u5316\u7ec4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u65f6\uff0cCooper\u5bf9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e Bogoliubov-\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u6e29\u5ea6\u5e73\u65b9\u9879\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u7535\u5bfc\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u95f4\u5185\uff0cCooper\u5bf9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0e Bogoliubov-\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4ea4\u53c9\u5b89\u5fb7\u96f7\u592b\u53cd\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5bfc\u7279\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We focus on a multiplicative power-law model $f(T,B) = c_1 T^\u03b1B^\u03b2$ and an additive mixed power-law model $f(T,B) = c_2 T^\u03b1+ c_3 B^\u03b2$. Using dynamical system techniques, we construct autonomous systems and identify de Sitter attractors that naturally explain late-time cosmic acceleration. Analytical stability conditions for these fixed points are derived, and numerical simulations reveal characteristic evolutionary patterns, such as spiral trajectories and damped oscillations in the additive mixed power-law model. Furthermore, statefinder diagnostics are applied to quantitatively distinguish these models from the standard $\u039b$CDM paradigm and other dark energy scenarios.

Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization.

However, their utilization is currently limited because of slow and imperfect state detection and weak dipolar interaction, limiting fast and large-scale entanglement generation. We propose and analyze a scheme for quantum logic control and measurement-based state preparation in a hybrid platform of polar molecules and neutral atoms. The method leverages fast, high-fidelity atom-molecule gates and high-fidelity atomic ancilla measurements to overcome the common challenges in molecule-only platforms, while preserving their diverse structural advantages. The proposed atom-molecule controlled-phase gate is based on resonant dipole-dipole exchange between a molecular rotational transition and an atomic Rydberg transition, rendering it three orders of magnitude faster than any direct molecule-molecule entangling gate. We further study several applications of our scheme including the preparation of molecular GHZ states for quantum enhanced precision measurements, the preparation of exotic molecular qudit states with topological order, and measurement-altered criticality. Our scheme is applicable to any polar molecule. It expands the paradigm of quantum logic control and paves the way to large-scale molecular entangled states.

The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As a prototypical example, deposition growth is often accompanied by irreversible morphological instabilities. Forecasting such transitions from pre-transition configurations remains fundamentally challenging, as early precursors are weak, spatially heterogeneous, and masked by inherent fluctuations. Here, we investigate compact-to-dendritic transitions (CDTs) in a two-dimensional particle-based electrodeposition model and formulate a horizon-based early-warning task using trajectory-resolved transition points. We demonstrate that anticipating the CDT is intrinsically a spatiotemporal problem: neither static morphological descriptors nor temporal learning applied to predefined features alone yields reliable predictive signals. In contrast, end-to-end learning of jointly optimized spatial and temporal representations from growth images enables robust anticipation across a wide range of prediction horizons. Analysis of the learned latent dynamics reveals the emergence of a low-dimensional surrogate variable that tracks progressive morphological destabilization and undergoes reorganization near the transition. We further show that the learned spatiotemporal representation exhibits limited but systematic transferability across reaction-rate conditions, with predictive performance degrading as the inference condition departs from the training condition, consistent with changes in the latent-state dynamics. Overall, our results establish a general formulation for forecasting incipient instabilities in nonequilibrium interfacial growth, with implications for the predictive monitoring and control of pattern-forming driven systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9897\u7c92\u7535\u6c89\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ece\u7d27\u51d1\u5f62\u5230\u6811\u72b6\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": " nonequilibrium \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u521d\u671f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": " \u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": " \u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u524d\u5411\u548c\u540e\u5411\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": " \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5404\u79cd nonequilibrium \u751f\u957f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u521d\u671f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

While many existing QRL studies apply quantum agents to classical environments, it has been realized that the potential advantages of QRL are most naturally explored in environments that exhibit intrinsically quantum characteristics, where the agent's observations and interactions arise from quantum processes. In this work, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning environment formulated as a challenge-response task with hidden information. In the proposed environment, Alice encodes a classical bit into the parameters of a quantum circuit, while Bob, with a trained reinforcement learning agent, interacts with a limited number of quantum state copies to infer the hidden bit. The agent must select measurement strategies and decide when to terminate the interaction under explicit resource constraints. To study the solvability of the proposed environment, we consider three agents: a purely classical agent, a lightweight hybrid agent and a deep hybrid agent. Through experiments, we analyze the trade-off between inference accuracy and quantum resource consumption under varying interaction penalties. Our results show that the lightweight hybrid agent achieves reliable inference using as few as two quantum state copies, outperforming both the classical baseline and the deep hybrid agent in highly resource-constrained regimes. We further evaluate robustness under realistic quantum noise models and discuss the relevance of the proposed environment for security-oriented applications, including quantum-assisted authentication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9690\u85cf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6311\u6218-\u5e94\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u3002Alice\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0cBob\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u526f\u672c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4f4d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u526f\u672c\u65f6\u5c31\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7528\u9014\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e2\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u53c8\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0cAlice\u7f16\u7801\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cBob\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\uff1a\u7ecf\u5178\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u6df7\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6781\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff08\u4ec5\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u526f\u672c\uff09\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4ee3\u7406\u3002\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In particular, the paradigmatic phenomenon of confinement, where dynamical matter is coupled to gauge fields and forms bound states, remains an open problem. In addition, LGTs can provide low-energy descriptions of quantum spin liquids, which is the focus of ongoing experimental research. However, the study of LGTs is often limited theoretically by their numerical complexity and experimentally in implementing challenging multi-body interactions, such as the plaquette terms crucial for the realization of many exotic phases of matter. Here we investigate a $(2+1)$D $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT coupled to hard-core bosonic matter featuring a global U(1) symmetry, and show that dynamical matter naturally induces sizable plaquette interactions even in the absence of explicit plaquette terms in the Hamiltonian. Using a combination of density matrix renormalization group simulations and neural quantum state calculations up to a system size of $20 \\times 20$, we analyze the model across different fillings and electric field strengths. At small coupling strength, we find a large plaquette expectation value, independent of system size, for a wide range of fillings, which decreases in the presence of stronger electric fields. Furthermore, we observe signatures of a confinement-deconfinement transition at weak coupling strengths. Our results demonstrate that dynamical U(1) matter can induce complex multi-body interactions, suggesting a natural route to the realization of strong plaquette terms and paving the way for realizing a topological quantum spin liquid protected by a large gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001U(1) \u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u8bf1\u5bfc\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9879\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u52a8\u6001U(1) matter\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6db5\u517b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5947\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728$20 \times 20$\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76", "result": "\u5728\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u675f\u7f1a\u6001-\u975e\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8; \u52a8\u6001U(1) \u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u663e\u8457\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528; \u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u968f\u586b\u5145\u5ea6\u548c\u7535\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001U(1) \u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9879\u548c\u88ab\u5927\u80fd\u95f4\u9699\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The model is obtained by an five-dimensional extension of topological axion electrodynamics in four dimensions. To study the symmetry structure, we couple background gauge fields to the symmetry currents via Stueckelberg couplings. We show that background gauge invariance requires modified gauge transformation laws, indicating the existence of a higher-group structure. Furthermore, we identify the underlying mathematical structure as a 3-crossed module by regarding the modified Stueckelberg couplings as curvatures of a higher-group gauge theory. We demonstrate that the gauge transformation laws derived from this algebraic structure are consistent with the analysis based on the gauge invariance.

Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering.

When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap.

Chirp masses are typically measured well, with the smallest fractional uncertainty being $2%$ at the $90%$ credible level. Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $\u0394\u03c7_{\\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $\u03c7<0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$.\n  We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $\u03c7_{\\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We use this map to construct circular strings, magnons, as well as plane waves in the BTZ geometry. We show that the $SL(2, R)$ charges of these states on $AdS_3$ and that of the corresponding states in the BTZ geometry are related by a boost. The dual description of these states in the BTZ geometry are local quench in the thermal CFT.

We study the task of reconstructing the Pauli-signal matrix $S_{ij}=\\text{Tr}(O_i \u03c1(t_j))$ for a collection of $M$ low-weight Pauli observables $\\{O_i\\}_{i=1}^M$ over $N$ timesteps $\\{t_j\\}_{j=1}^N$, while minimizing the total number of device shots. We propose a Compressed Sensing Shadow Tomography (CSST) protocol that combines two complementary reductions. First, local classical shadows reduce the observable dimension by enabling many Pauli expectation values to be estimated from the same randomized snapshots at a fixed time. Second, compressed sensing reduces the time dimension by exploiting the fact that many expectation-value traces are spectrally sparse or compressible in a unitary (e.g., Fourier) transform basis. Operationally, CSST samples $m\\ll N$ timesteps uniformly at random, collects shadows only at those times, and then reconstructs each length-$N$ signal via standard $\\ell_1$-based recovery in the unitary transform domain. We provide end-to-end guarantees that explicitly combine shadow estimation error with compressed sensing recovery bounds. For exactly $s$-sparse signals in a unitary transform basis, we show that $m=O \\left(s\\log^2 s \\log N\\right)$ random timesteps suffice (with high probability), leading to total-shot savings scaling as $\\widetilde\u0398(N/s)$ (i.e., up to polylogarithmic factors) relative to collecting shadows at all $N$ timesteps.

We first recover some well-established results: the existence of Yang-Mills theory and gravity, as well as the inconsistency of interacting multi-graviton theories. We explicitly construct several lower-derivative and lower-spin quartic vertices. We then turn to theories involving massless higher-spin fields. It becomes evident that the quartic constraint does not allow many cubic interactions to survive, in accordance with the well-known no-go results. Nevertheless, once higher-derivative cubic vertices are included, we find nontrivial solutions to the full quartic constraint and determine the corresponding quartic vertices. On this basis, we conjecture the complete set of quartic vertices that solve the light-cone consistency conditions. Exploiting this, we find all allowed unitary local higher-spin theories and identify new families of local quasi-chiral higher-spin theories. We then determine all local higher-spin four-point amplitudes using the spinor-helicity formalism together with locality. We conclude with a short discussion on non-locality and propose a ``local'' (at the amplitude level) higher-spin theory in flat space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e73\u9762\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56db\u9636Poincare\u4ee3\u6570\u95ed\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6d89\u53caMHV\u548c\u53cd-MHV\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u975e\u5168\u7eaf\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u4f4e\u9636\u4f4e\u6b21\u56db\u9636\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5982Yang-Mills\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u91cd\u5f15\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56db\u9636\u7ea6\u675f\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u4e09\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u201c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u201d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4f46\u5f53\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u9876\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b8c\u6574\u56db\u9636\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3\u5149\u9525\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u56db\u9636\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u56db\u70b9\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb-\u6781\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u56db\u70b9\u632f\u5e45\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u524d\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u56db\u9636Poincare\u4ee3\u6570\u95ed\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5149\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5149\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cPoincare\u4ee3\u6570\u95ed\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u56db\u9636\u9876\u70b9\u548c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u62df\u5168\u81ea\u65cb\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u56db\u70b9\u632f\u5e45\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5149\u524d\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u56db\u9636\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u9876\u70b9\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u81ea\u65cb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The materials of this paper have been used for a report at the XXVII Russian Youth Conference on Physics of Semiconductors and Nanostructures, Opto- and Nanoelectronics", "summary": "The dispersion curves for the electrons and holes in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), with the spin-orbit coupling taken into account. The effective masses of the charge carriers are obtained using the parabolic approximation of the dispersion curves in different directions in the $k$-space. It is found that the dispersion curves demonstrate strong nonparabolicity at energies above 0.2 eV for electrons and above 0.1 eV for holes, available for experimental study by the means of optical spectroscopy. We propose a model that describes the dispersion dependences of charge carriers at those energies, where the effective masses of the quasiparticles depend quadratically on the wave vector. An expression is obtained according to the model, which can accurately approximate the dispersion curves for the electron and the hole in all symmetric directions from the center to the boundary of the Brillouin zone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9CsPbI3\u5728\u659c\u65b9\u6676\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u8272\u6563\u66f2\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86DFT\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728k\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u80fd\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc70.2 eV\u65f6\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\uff0c0.1 eV\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5bf9\u7a7a\u7a74\uff0c\u8272\u6563\u66f2\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u975e\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u5149\u8c31\u5149\u5b66\u624b\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u8272\u6563\u968f\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6ce2\u77e2\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u51c6\u786e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6240\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u8272\u6563\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002DFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u7535\u6027\u8d28\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8272\u6563\u66f2\u7ebf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\uff08DFT\uff09\u5bf9CsPbI3\u5728\u659c\u65b9\u76f8\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97k\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u8272\u6563\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u6ce2\u77e2\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u80fd\u91cf\u9ad8\u4e8e0.2 eV\uff08\u7535\u5b50\uff09\u548c0.1 eV\uff08\u7a7a\u7a74\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u8272\u6563\u66f2\u7ebf\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u975e\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u80fd\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5747\u4e3a\u53ef\u7528\u3002 effective masses of\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u968f\u80fd\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7b26\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7DFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u529f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CsPbI3\u659c\u65b9\u76f8\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u7a7a\u7a74\u7684\u8272\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u975e\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u53ca\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Using the junction method and asymptotic expansions of Hankel functions, we derive accurate asymptotic expressions for the time evolution of mode functions and the resulting power spectrum, based on three systematic rules for identifying the dominant terms across transitions. Our results reveal that a finite dip of the final power spectrum arises from the cancellation between two growing modes within the linear perturbation theory, rather than between constant and growing terms as previously suggested. We also provide analytical descriptions of the amplitude enhancement and oscillatory features in the linear power spectrum, in agreement with numerical computations.

While recent quantum algorithms have enabled efficient quantum preparation of thermal states, observable estimation via sampling remains costly: a straightforward implementation separates successive measurements by a full mixing time in order to ensure samples are approximately independent. In this work, we show that the sampling cost can be substantially reduced by using a single Gibbs-sampling trajectory. After a single burn-in period, we interleave coherent measurements that satisfy detailed balance with respect to the target Gibbs state. The efficiency of this approach rests on the fact that, in many settings, the autocorrelation time can be significantly shorter than the mixing time. For energy estimation (and more generally for observables commuting with the Hamiltonian), we implement the required measurements using Gaussian-filtered quantum phase estimation with only logarithmic overhead.

The topics which are reviewed are: the definition of BMS transformations as conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity, the semidirect structure of the BMS group, the holographic reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime in terms of good cuts, the one-to-one correspondence between good cut subspaces and Poincar\u00e9 subgroups (aka vacua), as well as a basic introduction to unitary representations of the BMS group.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bb2\u4e49\u7b14\u8bb0\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86BMS\u7fa4\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7fa4\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u7fa4\u8bba\u5f15\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3BMS\u7fa4\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7fa4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7fa4\u8bba\u5b9a\u4e49BMS\u7fa4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf bulk\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u597d\u5207\u9762\u91cd\u5efaMinkowski\u65f6\u7a7a\u548cBMS\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "BMS\u7fa4\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7fa4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We employ Wigner-Weyl calculus in order to represent the Hall viscosity in terms of a topological invariant comprised of Green functions and work within the composite fermion field theory model of Jain states of the fractional quantum Hall fluid presented by Lopez and Fradkin. The topological expression is first derived within the free field theory of electrons and explicitly calculated for this case as well as in the mean field approximation of the composite fermion theory Jain states. The topological orbital spin of composite fermions distinguishes their mean field treatment from that of electrons resulting in an additional topological contribution. We then argue that the introduction of Coulomb interactions does not lead to perturbative corrections of the Hall viscosity in both integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids. The proof relies on the assumptions of homogeneity and rotational invariance of an underlying sample modulo the vector potential giving rise to the homogeneous external magnetic field. These conditions imply a Hall viscosity per emergent quasiparticle number density quantized in units of one half times the average quasiparticle orbital spin or one quarter times the Wen-Zee shift. The latter features a contribution from the composite fermion topological orbital spin relative to that of electrons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

But while it is well established that stabilizer codes in higher spatial dimensions gain additional levels of intrinsic robustness, higher-dimensional Floquet codes have hitherto been explored only in limited scope. Here we introduce a 3d generalization of a Floquet code whose instantaneous stabilizer group realizes a 3d fermionic toric code, while crucially preserving all three logical qubits throughout the entire measurement sequence. One central ingredient is the identification of a 3d lattice geometry that generalizes the features of the Kekul\u00e9 lattice underlying the 2d Hastings-Haah code - specifically, a structure where deleting any one edge color yields a two-color subgraph that decomposes into short, closed loops rather than homologically nontrivial chains. This loop property avoids the collapse of logical information that plagues naive sequential two-color measurement schedules on many 3d lattices. Although, for our lattice geometry, a simple 3-round cycle that sequentially measures the three types of parity checks does not expose the full error syndrome set, we show that one can append a measurement sequence to extract the missing syndromes without disturbing the logical subspace. Beyond code design, 3d tricoordinated lattice geometries define a family of 3d monitored Kitaev models, in which random measurements of the non-commuting parity checks give rise to dynamically created entangled phases with nontrivial topology. In discussing the general structure of their underlying phase diagrams and, in particular, the existence of certain quantum critical points, we again make a connection to the general preservation of logical information in time-ordered Floquet protocols.", "AI": {"tldr":

In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u70ed\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4$\bar{Z}_N$\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53bb\u7c92\u5b50\u5316\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Svetitsky-Yaffe\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0$\bar{Z}_5$\u7406\u8bba\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u76f8\u5177\u6709 emerges \u7684U(1) \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6807\u91cf\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u70ed\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7c92\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u53d6\u5171\u5f62\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u6027\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u9488\u5bf9$N=2,3,5$\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86Svetitsky-Yaffe\u731c\u60f3\u3002$\bar{Z}_5$\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u76f8\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51faEmerges\u7684U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Gu-Wen\u6bd4\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u8026\u5408\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6a21\u62df\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e34\u754c\u8026\u5408\u503c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86$N=2,3$\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u96f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u53bb\u7c92\u5b50\u5316\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u501f\u52a9\u70ed\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4$\bar{Z}_N$\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53bb\u7c92\u5b50\u5316\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76f8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size.", "AI": {"tldr": "GNRs show size-dependent electrical properties, including CNP sign changes, which are influenced by electric fields and band structure.", "motivation": "Understanding how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are influenced by their size is crucial for advancing graphene-based nanotechnology applications, such as electronics and sensing.", "method": "The authors used computational modeling of electric fields and conductance in GNRs with an AFM tip to explore the size-dependent electrical properties, and then employed high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) to confirm their findings experimentally.", "result": "The computational modeling revealed that the CNP shifts towards lower values as the GNR width decreases due to enhanced edge electric fields, but a sign change is not expected.

The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=\u03c0$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies a non-reciprocal Haldane model with time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings (ERs) in its spectrum.

Our method also allows us to derive formulas for the orbital magnetic susceptibility. The results are expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent wavefunctions and the Hartree-Fock energy spectrum at zero magnetic field.

It is known that probes exhibiting degeneracy in their energy-level structure can achieve larger sensitivities, while probes with a more uniform spectrum may remain sensitive over a broader temperature range. Here, we study the thermometric performance of a multilevel quantum Rabi model in which two well-separated atomic manifolds of near-degenerate levels couple to a single cavity mode. We generalise the standard quantum Rabi treatment in the adiabatic regime to find an approximate closed-form expression for the thermal QFI. We then characterise two complementary limits. On the one hand, a large dark-state manifold (dark-manifold saturation) produces a robust peak in thermal sensitivity due to bright--dark population transfer. Such increase in sensitivity is further maximised at an intermediate light--matter coupling strength. Maximising instead the number of bright states (bright-manifold saturation) generates a broadband thermal response that becomes increasingly stable under random light--matter couplings as the number of levels is increased. The rich spectral structure of our cavity-QED model thus makes it a versatile and sensitive equilibrium thermometer over a broad range of temperatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "A quantum probe's temperature sensitivity can be improved by designing its energy spectrum carefully, especially when it's near-degenerate.

Here, we study the use of weighted graph states as more accessible resources for quantum metrology, which yield a favorable precision beyond the classical limit, approaching the Heisenberg limit. We find a notable robustness to variation in weights and less challenging weight requirements compared to standard graph states, which require a maximal weight at all edges. Both of these aspects reduce the practical demands in a physical setup, with the latter implying significantly less entanglement is required to gain a quantum advantage in metrology.

Our main contributions are twofold: first, we establish a criterion for the uniqueness of steady states. The criterion is formulated in terms of the algebra generated by the GKSL generators and provides a necessary and sufficient condition when the generators are analytic functions of time. We demonstrate the utility of our criterion through prototypical examples, including quantum many-body spin chains. Second, we extend the concept of strong symmetry for time-dependent GKSL equations by introducing two distinct forms, strong symmetry in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture and that in the interaction picture, and completely classify the asymptotic dynamics with them. More concretely, we rigorously uncover that the strong symmetry in the interaction picture is responsible for non-trivial time-dependent steady states, such as coherent oscillations, whereas that in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture controls the existence of time-independent steady states. This classification not only encompasses established mechanisms underlying non-trivial oscillatory steady states, such as strong dynamical symmetry and Floquet dynamical symmetry, but also reveals symmetry-predicted, time-dependent asymptotic dynamics in a novel class of open quantum systems.

The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch-type inequalities that remain sharp in this regime by exploiting rank constraints from partial transposition and spectral properties of the partially transposed Haar moment operator. We prove that the deviation from the Welch bound captures the average-case approximation error, hence characterizing a natural notion of minimum achievable error at fixed cardinality. For $k=3$, we prove that SICs and complete MUB sets saturate our bounds, making them optimal approximate 3-designs of their cardinality. This leads a natural variational criterion to rule out the existence of a complete set MUBs, which we use to obtain numerical evidence against such set in dimension $6$. As a key technical ingredient, we compute the complete spectrum of the partially transposed symmetric-subspace projector, including multiplicities and eigenvectors, which may find applications beyond the present work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u6709\u9650\u7684\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u54c8\u745f\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff1f Welch\u754c\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u5f53 Instruction\uff1a\u8bf7\u6839\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u7684\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002 Welch\u754c\u9650\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u601d\u662f Welch\u754c\u9650\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9 $k$-\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7ee7\u800c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u7684 Welch \u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u7684 Welch \u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5f62\u6210 exact $k$-design\u6240\u9700\u6570\u91cf\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u8f6c\u7f6e\u548c Haar \u77e9\u9635\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u5173\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u903c\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u4e8e $k=3$\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5747\u5300\u57fa\uff08SICs\uff09\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u4e92\u60e0\u57fa\uff08MUB\uff09\u7cbe\u786e\u9971\u548c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e SICs \u548c\u5b8c\u5168 MUB \u96c6\u662f\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c $3$-\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b4) \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u6392\u9664\u5173\u4e8e\u5b58\u5728\u6240\u6709 MUB \u7684\u96c6\u5408\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6 6 \u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1b\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u8f6c\u7f6e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8c31\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u6570\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 Welch\u754c\u9650\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u5728 Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9650\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the generator always has the same structure as the standard Pauli-Lindblad model, the rates may be negative or complex. We show that random Pauli channels are almost always non-Markovian, with the probability of encountering a negative rate converging doubly exponentially to unity with the number of qubits. For physically motivated noise models shaped by Pauli twirling, including single-qubit over-rotations and two-qubit amplitude damping errors, we find that negative rates are generic, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. We generalize probabilistic error amplification and cancellation to non-Markovian generators, and quantify the sampling overhead introduced by negative and complex rates. Experiments on superconducting qubits confirm that allowing negative rates in the learned noise model yields more accurate predictions than restricting to non-negative rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We present a quenched density framework that uses the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to rewrite the reduced equilibrium state as an average over local propagators in imaginary time. This approach rigorously separates the statistical definition of the environment from the algebraic structure of the system response. We apply this framework to the minimal case of a harmonic environment with a coupling commuting with the system Hamiltonian. In this scenario the correction to the HMF has an exact, closed-form expression. We validate this result against finite-bath trace-out calculations and stochastic imaginary-time sampling in a five-level projector-coupled model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u6700\u5c0f\u73af\u5883\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Hubbard-Stratonovich \u8f6c\u6362\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86 Hubbard-Stratonovich \u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u5e73\u8861\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u4f20\u64ad\u5668\u5728\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u73af\u5883\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u7cbe\u786e\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e14\u8026\u5408\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684 correction \u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u70ed\u5e93\u8ff9\u79fb\u7b97\u548c\u968f\u673a\u865a\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
