Here we demonstrate that these improvements arise from differences in the one-particle density matrix that are encoded into the non-canonical Fock matrix and not from the nature of the KS orbitals, as is commonly assumed. Equipped with this insight, KS-CCSD(T) can be leveraged to achieve near-chemical-accuracy for electronic and thermochemical properties of transition-metal dimers and main-group compounds. Most strikingly, KS-CCSD(T) qualitatively recovers the entire Cr$_2$ potential energy surface, a notorious failure case for HF-CCSD(T) and single-reference density functional theory. We further introduce a density difference diagnostic that identifies multireference character and guides practitioners toward rational selections of optimal references at mean-field cost. These results establish KS-CCSD(T) as a practical route to treat strong correlation within the \"gold standard\" framework, and this has immediate implications for machine learning potential development and materials research, areas that heavily rely on KS-DFT for model-parameter fitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provides a rigorous framework for incorporating NQEs, but its practical applicability is often limited by the slow and strongly system-dependent convergence with respect to the number of beads. Here we introduce path-integral generalized smoothed trajectory analysis (PIGSTA), a post-processing framework for the systematic incorporation of NQEs into atomistic simulations, using either classical or path-integral molecular dynamics trajectories. By applying analytically defined convolution kernels to simulation trajectories, PIGSTA corrects the frequency-dependent discretization error associated with a finite number of beads, without modifying the underlying dynamics. For harmonic systems, PIGSTA recovers the exact quantum-mechanical limit at any bead number, whereas standard PIMD becomes exact only in the infinite-bead limit. More generally, the method significantly improves the convergence of thermodynamic and structural observables at finite bead numbers and provides an internal, reference-free diagnostic of bead-number convergence based on the consistency of energy and force estimators. We assess PIGSTA for ambient liquid water and for the Zundel cation at ultralow temperature, representing a particularly demanding case for bead-number convergence. In both systems, PIGSTA reproduces the converged PIMD limit and enables physically consistent results at reduced bead numbers when convergence criteria are satisfied. Owing to its post-processing nature and negligible additional computational cost, PIGSTA offers a practical and broadly applicable approach for incorporating NQEs into atomistic simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6PIGSTA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u6838\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u9650\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5206\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u7eb3\u5165\u6838\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6709\u9650\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08PIMD\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u6162\u6536\u655b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "PIGSTA\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u5bf9\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6821\u6b63\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9891\u7387\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6216\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u8d28\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8c10\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cPIGSTA\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6PIMD\u4ec5\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u624d\u7cbe\u786e\u3002\u5728\u975e\u8c10\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cPIGSTA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u529b\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u6536\u655b\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "conclusion": "PIGSTA\u4e3a\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6838\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6c34\u76f8\u548cZundel\u79bb\u5b50\u7b49\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u573a\u5408\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8d28\u70b9\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u5ec9\u3002"}}

We present a joint experimental-theoretical investigation of dimethyl phosphate (DMP-) in aqueous solution, an established model system of the sugar-phosphate backbone. Utilizing 31P-NMR spectroscopy as probe of phosphate-ion association, variations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ content exhibit a systematic shielding of the 31P chemical shift (\u03b4iso(31P)) with moderate temperature dependence. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio (GIAO-DF-LMP2) level of theory are used to reveal the microscopic mechanism. Simulations are performed for a configurational ensemble of DMP-ion geometries and their first solvation shells, demonstrating (i) the spatial convergence of changes of the nuclear shielding constant \u03c3iso(31P), (ii) the intramolecular geometric origin of short-timescale \u03c3iso(31P) fluctuations and (iii) an average shift of \u03c3iso(31P) of about 3-5 ppm upon contact ion pair formation with Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions. A quantitative analysis of \u03b4iso(31P) for varying ion content and temperature allows us to extract the temperature-dependent fraction of the contact ion pair species, indicating that solvent separated or free ion pairs are the energetically preferred species.

As a necessary prerequisite, we demonstrate how both PGTs and APTs can accurately be computed from electronic-structure theory, validate them across formally equivalent derivative formulations, and thereby benchmark their numerical consistency. We then employ machine learning as an efficient surrogate to represent the validated APT and PGT response functions on aqueous benchmark systems. We validate the trained models directly at the level of the spectrum against explicit ab initio reference calculations and find that IR and Raman spectra converge with surprisingly small training sets. Moreover, spectral agreement improves more rapidly than the root-mean-square error (RMSE). While RMSE is straightforward to compute, statistically converged reference spectra are generally impractical to obtain, motivating the need to relate model-level errors to observable-level accuracy. By connecting these complementary error measures, we provide practical guidelines and early-stopping criteria for achieving sufficient spectral fidelity. By integrating response-tensor learning, automated training, and spectral-domain validation into a unified workflow, mimyria enables data-efficient and quantitatively reliable vibrational spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "The framework mimyria enables data-efficient and quantitatively reliable vibrational spectroscopy by integrating response-tensor learning, automated training, and spectral-domain validation into a unified workflow.", "motivation": " advancement in molecular dynamics and machine learning for vibrational spectroscopy.", "method": "Introduces mimyria framework incorporating electronic-structure calculations, machine learning models for polarizability gradient tensor (PGT) and atomic polar tensor (APT), and generates IR and Raman spectra.", "result": "Models trained with small datasets show excellent spectral convergence and accuracy.", "conclusion": "mimyria provides a scalable and reliable approach for vibrational spectroscopy, bridging theory and experiment in condensed-phase systems."}}

Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \\propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits.

The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters.

The BBU instability induces oscillations in the trailing bunch, which are detrimental to its beam quality.

The detrimental effect on beam quality is substantially worse at high efficiencies, which places constraints on the achievable power efficiency in applications such as linear colliders, where maintaining the beam quality is required. In this paper, we present the first experimental signatures of the BBU instability in data taken in the E302 experiment at the FACET-II facility at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \\cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $\u03ba(\u03b4)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $\u03b4$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $\u03ba(\u03b4)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $\u03ba(\u03b4)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(\u03c0,\u03c0)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $\u03c9=0$. The Knight shift, $\u03c7_{sp}(0,0)(\u03b4)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \\approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $\u03b4_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $\u03b4=\u03b4_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states.

Here, the full subgap DoS of amorphous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) TFTs, used in display panels and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) development, is measured by ultrabroadband photoconduction (UP-DoS) microscopy to within 0.1 eV of the mobility edge. The measured subgap DoS for 25 TFT processing conditions accurately predicts each transfer curve, showing how shallow defect states are electron traps that rigidly tune subthreshold swing, threshold voltage and drift mobility. For a set of TFTs, the subthreshold transfer characteristics can be independently simulated from the experimental shallow defect DoS, with no adjustable parameters. The full transfer curve is simulated by introducing a single parameter: the conduction band tail energy. Additionally, the simulation reveals that the shallow trap density controlling subthreshold behavior can be directly extracted from transfer curves. Finally, a systematic In-enrichment study, combined with DFT+U DoS simulations, enables identification of vacancy cation coordination environments for all experimentally observed subgap peaks.

In this work, the direct laser writing of such channels between diamond films and glass substrates is introduced.

The strip induces delamination of the surrounding film, causing the formation of two nanochannels with triangular cross-sections.

With atomic force microscopy, the maximum strip spacing that produces these nanochannels is investigated, and it is demonstrated that the reflectance of the channels can be measured by microspectrophotometry. The microstructure of the nanochannels, including nanostrips, and processes that occur during laser writing are inferred from transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy.

Existing manifold-based approaches often rely on polynomial parameterizations, limiting their effectiveness for general smooth, non-polynomial nonlinearities. To overcome these limitations, we develop a direct optimization framework that employs a Lagrange multiplier formulation to determine the resonance backbone curve on the response surface constrained by the harmonic balance governing equations. Crucially, solving this formulation efficiently requires second-order sensitivity information. Therefore, the primary innovation of this work is the derivation of a analytical Hessian Tensor for generic $C^2$-continuous nonlinear elements. This is achieved by combining an extended Alternating Frequency/Time (AFT) method for computing second-order derivatives with local-coordinate tensor transformations. By integrating this analytical Hessian into the solver, the proposed framework ensures robust convergence and significantly reduces runtime, making it practical for large-scale models where numerical differentiation is computationally prohibitive. The method is validated on three benchmarks of increasing complexity: a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) system with cubic nonlinearity, a beam with cubic stiffness or hyperbolic tangent (tanh) friction nonlinearities, and an industrial-scale finite element model of a compressor bladed disk (blisk) with a friction ring damper.

In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.\n  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.\n  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign.

This Hamiltonian-level control induces dynamics under a superposition of different lattice configurations and guides the many-body system to novel strongly-correlated states where different phases of matter coexist -- ordering photons into superpositions of solid and fluid eigenstates. Leveraging hybrid control modalities, we adiabatically introduce disorder to localize the photons into an entangled cat state and enhance its coherence using a many-body echo technique.

Here we demonstrate broadband continuous frequency tuning in a non-Hermitian laser array achieved solely by controlling the pump currents. We show that in two coupled sub-lasers with frequency detuning ($\u0394\u03c9$) and relative loss ($\u0394\u03b1$), a mode-switching boundary emerges in the ($\u0394\u03c9$, $\u0394\u03b1$) parameter space, shaping the frequency landscape of the lower-loss supermode. The topology of this boundary comprises pseudo-symmetric (PS) and pseudo-symmetry-broken (PSB) branches connected at an exceptional point (EP). When tuning trajectories cross the PS branch, frequency tuning is discontinuous, whereas trajectories crossing the PSB branch enable continuous tuning; trajectories through the EP yield the maximum continuous tuning range. Experiments using two coupled terahertz quantum cascade lasers demonstrate continuous tuning over 10 GHz, enabled by arbitrarily many combinations of pump currents. Extending this approach to a multi-element array further expands the continuous tuning range to 163 GHz. These results establish a general route to broadband continuous tuning in moving-part-free semiconductor lasers and highlight the potential for dynamic eigenvalue engineering in non-Hermitian photonics and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6cf5\u6d66\u7535\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u5bbd\u9891\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u79fb\u52a8\u90e8\u4ef6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u9ad8\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u7ec4\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u65e0\u79fb\u52a8\u90e8\u4ef6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e76\u8054\u7684\u81ea\u50ac\u5316\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u6cf5\u6d66\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u50ac\u5316\u5b50\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb(\u0394\u03c9)\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931(\u0394\u03b1)\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u8fb9\u754c\u7531\u4f2a\u5bf9\u79f0(PS)\u548c\u4f2a\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u574f(PSB)\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5947\u70b9\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5f53\u626b\u63cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u8de8\u8d8aPS\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\uff0c\u9891\u7387\u626b\u63cf\u662f\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8aPSB\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7EP\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u4e24\u4e2a\u7c7b\u56fa\u9187\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea7\u8054\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u6cf5\u6d66\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u572810 GHz\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u5143\u7d20\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97163 GHz\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u626b\u63cf\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6cf5\u6d66\u7535\u6d41\u8c03\u8282\u5b9e\u73b0\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u5bbd\u9891\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u65e0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u79fb\u52a8\u578b\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The formalism immediately incorporates a lower-dimensional analog of $\\text{T}\\bar{\\text{T}}(+\u039b_2)$ deformations, denoted $T^2(+\u039b_1)$, as special cases. In general, the deformation mixes the chord basis of the Hilbert space in the seed theory, which we order through a modification of the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting chord number in the ordered basis represents a wormhole length at a finite cutoff in the bulk. We study the thermodynamic properties of the deformed theory; the evolution of $n$-point correlation functions with matter chords; the growth of complexity of the Hartle-Hawking state; and the entanglement entropy between the double-scaled algebras for a given chord state. The latter, in the triple-scaling limit, manifests as the minimal codimension-two area in the bulk following the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.

In addition to constructing experiments using radiopure materials and handling in underground laboratories, it is necessary to understand and reduce known backgrounds in data analysis. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta Decay is searching for this decay using 76Ge-enriched high-purity germanium detectors submerged in an active liquid argon veto. A significant background in LEGEND is surface events from shallowly-impinging radiation on detector surfaces. In this paper we introduce the Collimated Alphas, Gammas, and Electrons (CAGE) scanning system, an internal-source scanning vacuum cryostat, designed to perform studies of surface events on sensitive surfaces of HPGe in a surface-lab. CAGE features a collimated radionuclide source inside a movable infrared shield that is able to perform precision scans of detector surfaces by utilizing three independent motor stages for source positioning. This allows detailed studies of pulse shapes as a function of source position and incident angle, where defining features can be extracted and exploited for removing surface backgrounds in data analysis in LEGEND. In this paper, we describe CAGE and demonstrate its performance with a commissioning run with 241Am.

While interfacing a single cavity to either an atom or ensemble has become a standard tool, the advent of single atom control in large atomic arrays has spurred interest in a new frontier of ``many-cavity QED,'' featuring many independent resonators capable of separately addressing individual quantum emitters. In this fast-evolving landscape, the cavity array microscope was recently introduced -- employing free space intra-cavity optics to engineer a two-dimensional array of tightly spaced cavity TEM$_{00}$ modes with wavelength-scale waists, ideally suited for interfacing with atom arrays. Here we realize the next-generation of this architecture, achieving hundreds of degenerate cavity modes with improved, uniform finesse, and explore the technical features of the system which will enable further scalability. In particular, we study imperfections, including optical aberrations, field of view constraints, array non-degeneracies, and losses from optical elements. We identify the sensitivity to these various vectors and exposit the control knobs and techniques necessary to align and operate the system in a stable manner. Ultimately, we lay out a pathway towards operation with tens of thousands of independent cavities while maintaining compatibility with existing atom arrays, paving the way to myriad applications including highly parallelized remote entanglement generation, fast and non-destructive mid-circuit readout, and the implementation of hybrid atom-photon Hamiltonians.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We investigate the excitation dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interaction confined in a potential well with finite depth and width driven by a strong oscillatory pulse field. By numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with Crank-Nicolson method and split operator method, we obtain the time-dependent wavefunction and therefore the evolution of density distribution in real space and that in momentum space, and the occupation distribution in energy space. It is shown that cold atoms with weak interaction oscillate as a whole body in a finite space when the amplitude of pulse drive is not strong enough. During the evolution atoms occupy the bound states with larger probability. Increasing the driving strength or atomic interactions promotes the excitation of atoms into continuum states and their diffusion out of the potential well, leading to complex structures or even interference-like patterns in the momentum distribution. The number of cycles in the pulse envelope plays a crucial role in the dynamical behavior: High-frequency driving can suppress diffusion and maintain localization. Furthermore, repulsive atomic interactions can enhance high-harmonic generation yields by several orders of magnitude.

Here we realize the Dicke model -- a fundamental description of light-matter interactions -- in a two-dimensional crystal of approximately 100 trapped ions. The ions' internal state is optically coupled to the center of mass vibrational mode via an optical spin-dependent force, enabling unitary many-body dynamics beyond the mean-field and few-body limits. In the integrable regime, where the phonons can be adiabatically eliminated, we observe a dynamical phase transition between ferromagnetic to paramagnetic spin phases. In contrast, when the spins and phonons are strongly coupled, we observe clear signatures of non-integrable chaotic dynamics, including erratic phase-space trajectories and the exponential growth of excitations and entanglement quantified by the one-body R\u00e9nyi entropy. By quenching from an unstable fixed point in the near-integrable regime, quantum noise can generate correlated spin-phonon excitations. Our numerical calculations, in clear agreement with experiment, reveal the generation of two-mode spin-phonon squeezing, 2.6 dB below the standard quantum limit (4.6 dB relative to the initial thermal state), followed by generalized vacuum Rabi collapses and revivals.

We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7279\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u53e3\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5f15\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e24\u7ec4\u4fdd\u89d2\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5931\u8861\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u8df3\u8dc3\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5de6\u3001\u53f3\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u7684\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6982\u7387\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u5de6\u3001\u53f3\u548c\u8054\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5728\u53f3\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u9075\u5faa\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u3002\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6563\u5c04\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u7269\u7406\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u522b\u6e90\u4e8e\u590d\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6001\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u6062\u590d\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u53cc\u805a\u4f53\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8f93\u8fd0\u662f\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5f15\u7ebf\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u72b6\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u53f3\u6563\u5c04\u6001\u65f6\u4e0d\u9075\u5b88\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6563\u5c04\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5176\u7269\u7406\u6765\u6e90\u5206\u522b\u6e90\u4e8e\u590d\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u548c\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\uff0c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u6765\u6e90\u3002"}}

Although the stabilization regime in such fields is theoretically established, its modified properties in the nondipole regime for long laser pulses remains unknown. Here, we numerically investigate the strong-field ionization of an atom in a long XUV laser pulse in the nondipole regime. Our study of the time-dependent quantum dynamics reveals a quasiperiodic modulation of the ionization yield as a function of pulse duration. We demonstrate that the Coulomb-field-induced slow oscillation of the ionized electron wave packet during the interaction is responsible for the observed modulation of the ionization yield. Furthermore, we scrutinize the unusual photon momentum sharing between the photoelectron and the ion in this extreme regime.

Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods.

A major challenge is the identification of such correlated systems with dominantly 1D physics. In this work, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As single crystal directly reveal quasi-1D spin excitations, resulting from atomic order that lead to magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Cu chains. The dominant exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic along the chain ($SJ_{\\rm \\parallel}\\approx90.1(3)$~meV), whereas the inter-chain couplings are much weaker ($SJ_{\\rm \\perp}\\approx-2.4(1)$~meV and $SJ_{\\rm c}\\approx0.15(5)$~meV).

A central phenomenon in these theories is confinement, which binds quarks and antiquarks into hadrons through the formation of string-like flux tubes of gauge fields. Simulating confinement dynamics is a challenging task, but recent advances in quantum simulation are enabling the exploration of LGTs in regimes beyond the reach of classical computation. For analog devices, a major difficulty is the realization of strong plaquette interactions, which generate string fluctuations that can drive a roughening transition. Understanding string roughening -- where strong transversal functions lead to an effective restoration of translational symmetry at long distances -- is of central importance in the study of confinement. In this work, we show that string roughening emerges naturally in an analog Rydberg quantum simulator. We first map a triangular Rydberg array onto a (2+1)D U(1) LGT where plaquette terms appear as first-order processes. We study flux strings connecting static charges and demonstrate that, near a deconfined quantum critical point, the string exhibits logarithmic growth of its transverse width as the separation between charges increases, along with the universal L\u00fcscher correction to the confining potential -- both signatures of string roughening. Finally, we investigate the real-time dynamics of an initially rigid string, observing large fluctuations after quenching into the roughening regime, as well as string breaking via particle-pair creation. Our results indicate that rough strings can be realized in experimentally accessible quantum simulators, opening the door to detailed studies of how strong fluctuations influence string-breaking dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528 Rydberg \u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Rydberg \u80fd\u7ea7\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62 Rydberg \u6570\u7ec4\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a (2+1) \u7ef4\u7684 U(1) \u78c1\u91cf\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u5176\u968f\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6d88\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 Rydberg \u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u78c1\u5355\u6781\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Their on-chip integration promises to bring metrology capacity outside of the lab, particularly since they can operate at low continuous-wave pump laser power in the dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) regime. Yet, such small foot-print and low power comes at a cost: higher noise and overall lower comb power. In particular, this translates to highly challenging detection and locking of the carrier-envelope offset, necessary for complete stabilization of the comb. Recently, Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) of a DKS to a reference laser has been demonstrated as a tool for passive all-optical stabilization of DKS microcombs, with fundamental modification to the DKS and microcomb properties. Here, we demonstrate that the combination of additional power from the reference laser (now part of the DKS) and the KIS phase locking that pins the repetition rate together fundamentally alter the DKS, forcing an energy redistribution to maintain its center of mass. We demonstrate this self-balancing effect theoretically, which in a pure quadratic dispersion resonator leads to reference-dependent recoil. With higher-order dispersion through which the DKS yields phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), we demonstrate that self-balancing increases the DW radiation, experimentally showing a 22 dB increase of comb teeth at 780 nm in an octave-spanning microcomb for efficient deployable carrier-envelope offset detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "A study demonstrates that integrating Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) into dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) microcombs enhances the stability and detectability of the carrier-envelope offset (CEO) by leveraging additional RF power from a reference laser, leading to an energy redistribution that maintains the comb's center of mass through self-balancing mechanisms.

This raises the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen.

For \u03be> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for \u03be\\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge.

A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, including variational methods. However, variational training often struggle to navigate complex energy landscapes, frequently encountering suboptimal local minima or suffering from barren plateaus. In this work, we introduce an iterative strategy for ground-state preparation based on a stepwise (discretized) Hamiltonian deformation.

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations.

In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration.

Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $\u03bd=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set.

Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 9968], in this work we propose a practical framework for determining the ensemble N-representability of a p-body matrix. This is accomplished using a purification strategy consisting of embedding an ensemble state into a pure state defined on an extended Hilbert space, such that the reduced density matrices of the purified state reproduce those of the original ensemble. By iteratively applying variational unitaries to an initial purified state, the proposed algorithm minimizes the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between its p-body reduced density matrix and a specified target p-body matrix, which serves as a measure of the N-representability of the target. This methodology facilitates both error correction of defective ensemble reduced density matrices, and quantum-state reconstruction on a quantum computer, offering a route for density-matrix refinement.

The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5c42\u4e0e\u8f6c\u7f6e\u7535\u81f4\u6781\u6027\u53cc\u5c42\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9759\u7535\u83ab\u5c14\u7684 potentials \u53ef\u4ee5\u5355\u72ec\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u7528\u63ba\u6742\u7684\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u7535\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63ba\u6742\u4f7f\u5f97\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u5e26\u9699\u88ab\u5c4f\u853d\u3002\u5f53\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8303\u970d\u592b\u5947\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d1\u751f\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96f6\u6b21\u548c\u4e8c\u6b21\u54cd\u5e94\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5171\u632f\u5438\u6536\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u5149\u751f\u4f0f\u7279 effic \u6548\u5e94\u3002\u6ce8\u5165\u5149\u751f\u7535\u6d41\u7531\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7981\u6b62\uff0c\u800c\u504f\u79fb\u5149\u751f\u7535\u6d41\u5219\u7531\u865a\u50cf\u5149\u7535\u8fc7\u6e21\u5f15\u8d77\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5fb7\u534e\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u4f4d\u52bf\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u5149\u7535\u81f4\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u79fb\u5149\u751f\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u6ce8\u5165\u5149\u751f\u7535\u6d41\u88ab\u6392\u9664\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u865a\u50cf\u5149\u7535\u8fc7\u6e21\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6c\u7f6e\u7535\u6781\u6027\u53cc\u5c42\u4e0e\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5149\u751f\u4f0f\u7279 effic \u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u88c5\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u970d\u91d1\u8f90\u5c04\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5f62\u5230\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff08\u79f0\u4f5c\u65f6\u949f\u72b6 page \u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7b49\u4e8e\u8d1d\u80af\u65af\u5766-\u970d\u91d1\u71b5\u3002\u5728\u65bd\u74e6\u5c14zschild\u3001\u96f7\u897f-\u8bfaordstr\u00f6m\u3001\u9759\u6001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u819c\u4e16\u754c\u30014\u7ef4 Kerr \u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ef4 Myers--Perry\u9ed1\u4f53 Research \u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u7ea0\u7f20\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6216\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u7535\u8377\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u6781\u8fd1\u548c\u6781\u8fd1\u6781\u8fd1\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u88ab\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u70ed\u632f\u8361\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u8fd1\u5730\u5e73\u9762\u524d\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c9b\u6216\u9632\u706b\u5899\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u5168\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u970d\u91d1\u8f90\u5c04\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5730\u5e73\u5c42\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u7ea0\u7f20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u770b\u5f97\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66 across \u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u7a7a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9ed1\u4f53\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5f62\u5230\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u523b\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u949f\u72b6 page \u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7b49\u4e8e\u8d1d\u80af\u65af\u5766-\u970d\u91d1\u71b5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6216\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u529b\u3001\u7535\u8377\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u6781\u8fd1\u548c\u6781\u8fd1\u6781\u8fd1\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u88ab\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u70ed\u632f\u8361\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u8fd1\u5730\u5e73\u9762\u524d\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c9b\u6216\u9632\u706b\u5899\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u5168\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u970d\u91d1\u8f90\u5c04\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5730\u5e73\u5c42\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u949f\u72b6\u7ea0\u7f20\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u7a7a\u3002"}}

Despite recent hardware improvements, the execution of empirical quantum optimization experiments at scales known to be hard for state-of-the-art classical solvers is not yet in reach. In this work, we offer a different way to approach combinatorial optimization with near-term quantum computing. Motivated by the promising results observed in using quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) for approximating complicated probability distributions, we combine ideas of sampling from the device with QeMCMC together with warm-starting and parallel tempering, in the context of combinatorial optimization. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm recovers the global optima for instances of the Maximum Independent Set problem (MIS) up to 117 decision variables using 117 qubits on IBM quantum hardware. We show early evidence of a scaling advantage of our algorithm compared to similar classical methods for the chosen instances of MIS.

(2025) [2], we utilize the deformed light-cone formalism to investigate the Carrollian version of a complex vector field theory. We find that after applying the null-reduction procedure and the Carrollian limit c $\\to$ 0, the \"-\" null-direction and spatial components of the parent vector field decouple completely into independent scalar fields, while the \"+\" null-direction component vanishes. We carefully derive and demonstrate the process by which the energy-momentum tensor degrades from the Lorentzian symmetry case to the non-relativistic scenario, and point out that the secondary constraint of the original parent theory will play a crucial role in the derivation of the Carrollian generators. Finally, as expected, the resulting generators produce the known kinematic Carrollian conformal algebraic commutation relations.

This study proposes chaotic dynamics as a novel indicator for scalar hair in Horndeski gravity. We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a static, spherically symmetric hairy black hole spacetime. Our results show that increasing scalar hair systematically suppresses orbital chaos, as evidenced by regularized precession, reduced Lyapunov exponents, and contracted Poincare sections. Furthermore, scalar hair enhances the correlation between the two gravitational wave polarization modes, restoring phase coherence. These findings demonstrate that chaotic observables and gravitational wave signatures can jointly serve as sensitive probes for black hole hair, offering a complementary approach to testing gravity in strong-field regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

General time reparametrizations induce oscillator--type terms governed universally by the Schwarzian cocycle, connecting the present construction to broader appearances of Schwarzian dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u81ea\u7531\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0e\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c04\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\u3001Cayley\u53d8\u6362\u548cSchwarzian\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a$\rp^1$\u4e0a\u7684\u5c04\u5f71\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86Schr\u00f6dinger-Jacobi\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684$SL(2,\r)$\u540c\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684Schr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5e38\u5f62\u6865\u53d8\u6362\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5171\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u62c9\u51ac\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684Canonical\u53d8\u6362\u53ca\u5176metaplectic\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50Cayley\u53d8\u6362\u4e0eBargmann\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u53d7\u632f\u5b50\u578b\u9879\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5bfc\u6570\u9879\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u7684Schwarzian\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "motivation": "\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u672c\u7c92\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5173\u8054\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5f8b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c04\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\u548cSchwarzian\u5bfc\u6570\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ece\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u7531\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5c04\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\uff0cCayley\u53d8\u6362\u548cSchwarzian\u5bfc\u6570\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5c04\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a$\rp^1$\u4e0a\u7684\u5c04\u5f71\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Canonical\u53d8\u6362\u548cmetaplectic\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u632f\u5b50\u7c7b\u578b\u9879\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u7ef4\u81ea\u7531\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u5bf9\u5e94\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u5229\u7528\u4e86Cayley\u53d8\u6362\u548cSchwarzian\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86Schr\u00f6dinger-Jacobi\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u540c\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50Cayley\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0eBargmann\u53d8\u6362\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u632f\u5b50\u578b\u9879\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684Schwarzian\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7531\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u4e3a\u5c04\u5f71\u5750\u6807\u548c\u4f7f\u7528Schwarzian\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5171\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50Cayley\u53d8\u6362\u4e0eBargmann\u53d8\u6362\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u632f\u5b50\u578b\u9879\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that the integrals appearing in the 2PN Hamiltonian can be evaluated numerically to machine precision, allowing for cross-validation against analytical results and enabling the full numerical computation of the $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian.

The second, referred to as \\emph{quantization-free JQPIE} (QF-JQPIE), omits quantization altogether, thereby avoiding the probabilistic nature of block-encoded quantization.

We review arguments demonstrating that in quantum gravity the algebra of observables at infinity is complete, both in AdS and in asymptotically flat space. This completeness implies that the bulk Hilbert space in quantum gravity does not factorize along the radial direction, undermining a key common assumption in Hawking's argument for information loss and in initial derivations of the Page curve. As a consequence, in a standard theory of gravity, information does not ``emerge'' from a black hole in the manner suggested by the Page curve; rather, it is already encoded in asymptotic observables. Relatedly, the full black hole interior, and not just an ``island'', can be reconstructed from exterior data. Page curves and islands can be obtained by removing the Hamiltonian from the exterior algebra. This may be implemented operationally by restricting access to part of the asymptotic region (a detector with a ``blind spot'') or, in the special case of null infinity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, by formally discarding the Hamiltonian from the set of observables despite its physical accessibility. Such Page curves describe only the redistribution of information between measured and unmeasured degrees of freedom, rather than fundamental information recovery. Finally, Page curves and islands also arise when a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath, a setup that yields a nonstandard theory of gravity. We show how, even in this setting, the unusual localization of information in gravity provides a concrete physical mechanism for information transfer from the gravitational system into the bath.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u5173\u4e8ePage\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u56de\u5e94\u4e86arXiv:2506.04311\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u4ee3\u6570\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662fAdS\u8fd8\u662f\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5b8c\u6210\u6027\u610f\u5473\u7740 bulk Hilbert\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86Hawking\u5173\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548cPage\u66f2\u7ebf\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e2d\u4ee5Page\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u201c\u4ea7\u751f\u201d\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684;\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u8fdc\u5904\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u5b64\u5c9b\u201d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u5916\u90e8\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230Page\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u5b64\u5c9b\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fdc\u5904\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u76f2\u533a\u201d\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u9762\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5149\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u5904\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3d\u7ba1\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u5f0f\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u6392\u9664\uff0c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cdPage\u66f2\u7ebf\u4ec5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u6d4b\u5f97\u548c\u672a\u6d4b\u5f97\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f Truthy\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cPage curves \u548c\u5b64\u5c9b\u8fd8\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u975e\u5f15\u529b\u70ed bath \u76f8\u8fde\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4ece\u5f15\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f20\u9001\u5230 bath \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u6f84\u6e05\u5173\u4e8ePage\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6 Hawking \u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u5047\u8bf4\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u987e\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u8bba\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u65e0\u7a77\u8fdc\u5904\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u524a\u5f31\u4e86Page\u66f2\u7ebf\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u89e3\u91ca;\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u8fdc\u5904\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u7f16\u7801;\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784;Page curves \u548c\u5b64\u5c9b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u800c\u975e\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236;\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u975e\u5f15\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aPage\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied.

Such errors can be problematic for quantum error correction (QEC) codes, which are generally designed to correct independent errors.

This is achieved by building from recently developed models of quasiparticle density, mapping radiation-induced qubit error rates onto a quantum error channel and simulation of a simple surface code. We also provide a performance metric to quantify the resilience of a QEC code to radiation impacts. Additionally, we sweep various parameters of chip design to test mitigation strategies for improved QEC performance.

This bulk phase shift admits a holographic interpretation as of the thermal momentum-space two-point function of a scalar operator in the CFT in the Regge limit. At small impact parameter, the phase shift acquires an imaginary part signaling inelastic scattering, obscuring the interpretation of time delay and deflection which become complex-valued. However, in a holographic CFT these quantities can also be extracted from the so called bulk-cone singularities of the position space thermal correlator. Extending this analysis to small impact parameters, we find that the position-space correlator develops a singularity precisely when a null geodesic reflects off the black hole singularity and reaches the opposite boundary.

Distinguished from trusted-device QRNGs whose security depends on characterized devices, semi-device-independent (semi-DI) QRNGs permit partial devices to be defective or even maliciously manipulated, which achieves a good trade-off between generation rate and security. In this paper, we propose a semi-DI QRNG that resists general attacks while accounting for finite-size effects. The protocol requires no rigorous characterization of the source and measurement devices other than limiting the energy of the emitted states, significantly reducing the demands on practical QRNG systems. Leveraging the tight Kato inequality for correlated variables, we show that our protocol generates more randomness than it consumes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scheme on a continuous-variable system with ternary inputs of states. Heterodyne detection is employed to enable phase compensation through data postprocessing, alleviating the stringent requirement on system stability.

Quantum technologies offer a fundamentally new means of shaping economic behavior by introducing non-classical correlations between decision-makers. Here we demonstrate a prototype quantum stock market in which entanglement between traders' valuations mitigates the runaway devaluation characteristic of speculative busts. Using reinforcement-learning agents trading a single commodity, we show that replacing classical valuations with quantum-correlated qubit-encoded valuations stabilizes prices and increases the AI traders' net worth relative to a classical market, where instead agents rapidly converge to liquidation strategies that collapse the asset value. To explain this behavior, we formulate and analyze a quantized version of the $p$-guessing game, a canonical model of speculative dynamics. Quantum entanglement and phase coherence reshape the strategic landscape, eliminating the pathological pure-strategy Nash equilibrium that drives market collapse in the classical game, while mixed-strategy equilibria remain non-degenerate and avoid bust-type outcomes. These results identify quantum correlations as a novel, endogenous mechanism for market stabilization and, more broadly, demonstrate the utility of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for uncovering optimal strategies in complex decision-making frameworks with quantum degrees of freedom.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3(Classical)\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u5e02\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5173 correlated qubit valuations\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u624b\u6bb5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u7ecf\u6d4e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We introduce three- and four-dimensional solutions that are rotating, asymptotically flat, and exhibit a linear dilaton vacuum. These solutions cannot be overspun, i.e., do not have an extremality condition, akin to higher-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with one rotational angle. Studying their thermodynamics reveals that the temperature associated to these solutions does not depend on the black hole mass, similar to the Witten black hole. We also find that their asymptotic symmetry group is more stringent than the BMS group. We consider the charged generalisations for these black holes, which introduces closed timelike curves within the inner horizon. We show that these black holes can be derived from the large-$d$ limit of the Myers-Perry black hole.

We focus on the small-frequency (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime relevant for the study of tidal effects, which can be mapped onto gravitational wave observables during the inspiraling phase of a merger. We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Under resonant excitation, we achieve a spin initialization fidelity of $99.69 \\pm 0.03\\%$ and a readout contrast of $98.31 \\pm 1.03\\%$.

Treating the ACE2--Spike interface as an open quantum system embedded in a biological environment, we simulate how vibrational interactions and environmental memory reshape the coupled receptor--ligand dynamics and modulate vibrationally assisted electron transfer (VA-ET). Using a Non-Markovian Stochastic Schr\"odinger Equation (NMSSE) approach, we simulate electron transfer between donor and acceptor states in ACE2 modulated by a specific vibrational mode of the Spike protein. The influence of environmental memory (non-Markovian dynamics) and non-Condon effects (vibrational modulation of electronic coupling) are analyzed in detail. In the Markovian limit with an Ohmic bath, population dynamics reduce to exponential kinetics, and extracted transfer rates agree with semiclassical Marcus--Jortner predictions in the appropriate regime. Beyond the Markovian, high-temperature limit, we observe clear deviations: non-exponential decay, coherent oscillatory features, and enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational frequency. Incorporating off-diagonal system--bath coupling alongside diagonal coupling shows that nuclear motion can dynamically gate electron tunneling, sharpening the frequency selectivity of the VA-ET mechanism. Finally, a structured (sub-Ohmic) environmental spectral density with long-lived correlations (``memory'') preserves electronic--vibrational coherence over longer times, amplifying vibrational selectivity under non-Condon coupling.

In the literature, the quantum state preparation algorithm by Sun et al. is known to be optimally bounded, defining the asymptotically optimal width-depth trade-off bounds with and without ancillary qubits. In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $\u039b$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition. Using the PennyLane library, this new algorithm for state preparation has been implemented and tested in a simulated environment for both dense and sparse quantum states, including those that are random and of physical interest.

From this result, we derive an integrated fluctuation theorem and a Clausius-like inequality that unifies the first and second laws in terms of invariant work and coherent heat. Entropy production is identified with the relative entropy between forward and backward probability measures on the gauge-reduced space of thermodynamic trajectories, revealing irreversibility as a geometric consequence of limited observability.

While addressing this, we also need to ensure high gate fidelity, suppression of unwanted ZZ cross-talk, a compact layout footprint, and minimal control hardware complexity to support scalability. In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is used as it is easier to scale, but it is limited by unwanted static ZZ interaction during single qubit operations, which degrades system performance. To overcome these challenges, we have introduced a first-of-its-kind hybrid tunable-coupling architecture that connects four fixed-frequency transmon qubits using a single coupler.

We introduce a Consensus-Entanglement-Aware Scheduling (CEAS) framework that co-designs quantum consensus protocols with adaptive entanglement management to enable robust synchronous training across distributed quantum processors. CEAS integrates fidelity-weighted aggregation, in which parameter updates are weighted by quantum Fisher information to suppress noisy contributions, with decoherence-aware entanglement scheduling that treats Bell pairs as perishable resources subject to exponential decay. The framework incorporates quantum-authenticated Byzantine fault tolerance, ensuring security against malicious nodes while maintaining compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under heterogeneous noise conditions, while numerical simulations demonstrate that CEAS maintains 10-15 percentage points higher accuracy compared to entanglement-oblivious baselines under coordinated Byzantine attacks, achieving 90 percent Bell-pair utilization despite coherence time limitations. This work provides a foundational architecture for scalable distributed quantum machine learning, bridging quantum networking, distributed optimization, and early fault-tolerant quantum computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CEAS improves the accuracy of distributed quantum neural networks by 10-15% under Byzantine attacks.", "motivation": "Distributed quantum machine learning requires overcoming entanglement fragility and synchronization.", "method": "CEAS uses quantum consensus protocols, adaptive entanglement management, and quantum authentication.", "result": "CEAS achieves 10-15% higher accuracy than baseline methods in distributed quantum machine learning.", "conclusion": "CEAS provides a robust architecture for scalable quantum neural networks."}}

This paper introduces the Quantum Sieve Tracer, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to characterize factual recall circuits. We implement a modular pipeline that first localizes critical layers using classical causal tracing, then maps specific attention head activations into an exponentially large quantum Hilbert space. Using open-weight models (Meta Llama-3.2-1B and Alibaba Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct), we perform a two-stage analysis that reveals a fundamental architectural divergence. While Qwen's layer 7 circuit functions as a classic Recall Hub, we discover that Llama's layer 9 acts as an Interference Suppression circuit, where ablating the identified heads paradoxically improves factual recall.

We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to the splitting of operator space into commuting sub-algebras. The commutant structure of the invariant algebra is then used to construct local conserved quantities. Using representation theory of finite matrix algebras, the general form of wall gates is derived as unitary automorphisms. Taking causal independence as a minimal model for non-ergodic dynamics, we study its effect on probes of many-body quantum chaos. We prove an entanglement area-law due to local constraints and we study its stability against projective measurements. In a random ensemble exhibiting causal independence, we compare spectral correlations with the universal (chaotic) ensemble using the spectral form factor.
