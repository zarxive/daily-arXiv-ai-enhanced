### [1] [Quantized Skeletal Learning (QSL): A Differentiable Programming Approach for Skeletal Reduction of Chemical Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14017)
*Opeoluwa Owoyele*

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种高效的数据驱动方法用于提取 skeletal 机制，为复杂化学反应的研究和工程应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach, referred to as Quantized Skeletal
Learning (QSL), for generating skeletal mechanisms. The approach has two key
components: (1) a weight vector that can be used to eliminate relatively
unimportant species and reactions, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable program
whose loss-function gradients, with respect to the weight vector, can be used
to adjust those weights. To promote sparsity in the weight vector -- and to
reduce the influence of certain reactions or species to zero -- an
$l_1$-regularized objective is employed alongside the standard mean squared
error loss, thus removing the least important components. The proposed QSL
approach is validated by generating skeletal mechanisms for methane and
ethylene based on the GRI 3.0 and USC II mechanisms, respectively,
demonstrating effectiveness in deriving skeletal mechanisms with various levels
of fidelity. Two variants of QSL, designated as QSL-R and QSL-S, are tested;
these focus on eliminating reactions and species, respectively. Analysis of
ignition delay times and species mass fractions demonstrate QSL's capabilities
to reliably and efficiently extract data-driven skeletal mechanisms of varying
fidelities from detailed mechanisms.

Result: 维持了稳定性并提高了准确性，尤其在结合人工智能和机器学习时表现突出

Conclusion: 该方法为基于长程相互作用的分子动力学模拟提供了可靠和高效的工具，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Shadow molecular dynamics provide an efficient and stable atomistic
simulation framework for flexible charge models with long-range electrostatic
interactions. While previous implementations have been limited to atomic
monopole charge distributions, we extend this approach to flexible multipole
models. We derive detailed expressions for the shadow energy functions,
potentials, and force terms, explicitly incorporating monopole-monopole,
dipole-monopole, and dipole-dipole interactions. In our formulation, both
atomic monopoles and atomic dipoles are treated as extended dynamical variables
alongside the propagation of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
that introducing the additional dipole degrees of freedom preserves the
stability and accuracy previously seen in monopole-only shadow molecular
dynamics simulations. Additionally, we present a shadow molecular dynamics
scheme where the monopole charges are held fixed while the dipoles remain
flexible. Our extended shadow dynamics provide a framework for stable,
computationally efficient, and versatile molecular dynamics simulations
involving long-range interactions between flexible multipoles. This is of
particular interest in combination with modern artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to develop
physics-informed and data-driven foundation models for atomistic simulations.
These models aim to provide transferable, high-accuracy representations of
atomic interactions that are applicable across diverse sets of molecular
systems, which requires accurate treatment of long-range charge interactions.

Abstract: The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical
real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is
widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand,
the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$
representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature,
respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of
quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the
matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $
\langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time
propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$
imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator.
However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence
in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve
this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $\langle
\tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, specifically for systems where
the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite
upper bound. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the
positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic
problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators,
and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical
examples.

### [5] [Beam Energy Measurement using a Bayesian Approach with the Stacked Foil Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14440)
*Alexander Gottstein,Lorenzo Mercolli,Eva Kasanda,Isidre Mateu,Lars Eggimann,Elnaz Zyaee,Gaia Dellepiane,Pierluigi Casolaro,Paola Scampoli,Saverio Braccini*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: A method to measure proton beam energy using a stacked foil technique and Bayesian inference has been developed, validated, and shown to be effective in various experimental setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring proton beam energy accurately is crucial in medical cyclotrons to ensure safe and effective radiation therapy. Existing methods face challenges, such as dependency on direct current or charge measurements, which may not be feasible in low-vacuum or air-exposed setups.

Method: The method combines a stacked foil technique with a Bayesian inference approach. By measuring the activity of $^{48}$V induced in a stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy is inferred without direct current or charge measurements, making it suitable for low-vacuum or air-exposed setups.

Result: The method allows robust energy estimation with a Bayesian fit, accounting for uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations validate the method's assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion and cross-section uncertainties. The method accurately measures beam energy across experimental setups at the Bern Medical Cyclotron and evaluates sensitivity to nuclear cross-section data and the number of foils in the stack.

Conclusion: This innovative method provides a reliable and versatile solution for proton beam energy measurement, addressing limitations of traditional techniques and expanding its applicability to various experimental conditions.

Abstract: We present a practical method to measure the energy of proton beams at a
medical cyclotron using the stacked foil technique in combination with a
Bayesian inference method. By measuring the $^{48}$V activity induced in a
stack of irradiated titanium foils, the proton energy can be inferred without
relying on direct current or charge measurements, making the method suitable
even for low-vacuum environments or air-exposed setups. This technique is
further extended to configurations where the beam energy is degraded to levels
around 8 MeV. A Bayesian fit of the measured activity profile allows not only
for a robust energy estimation but also for a consistent treatment of
uncertainties and nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to
validate the underlying assumptions, including the impact of energy dispersion
or cross-section uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that this method
provides accurate beam energy measurements across several typical experimental
setups used at the Bern Medical Cyclotron. Additionally, we evaluate the
sensitivity of the method to the choice of nuclear cross-section data and
assess how the number of foils in the stack affects the uncertainty in the
inferred beam energy.

Abstract: We review recent advances in the study of nonlinear dynamics in mode-locked

advanced diagnostics and control strategies -- including genetic algorithms --
we uncover a rich spectrum of dynamical behaviours, including frequency-locked
breathers, fractal Farey hierarchies, Arnold tongues with anomalous features,
and breather molecular complexes. We also identify a novel route to chaos via
modulated subharmonic states. These findings underscore the utility of fibre
lasers as model systems for exploring complex dissipative dynamics, offering
new opportunities for ultrafast laser control and fundamental studies in
nonlinear science.

Conclusion: 该研究为范德华材料的光非线性性质提供了关键见解，为集成式光子电路和设备开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Layered van der Waals materials offer novel opportunities for on-chip
waveguiding and development of integrated photonic circuits. In the strong
light-matter coupling regime, their nonlinear response can be significantly
enhanced, which is crucial for developing active photonic devices. However,
probing the nonlinearity of waveguide modes in subwavelength-thick structures
is challenging as they are not directly accessible from far-field. Here we
apply a novel nonlinear near-field spectroscopic technique based on a GaP solid
immersion lens and femtosecond laser excitation to study nonlinearity of guided
modes in monolayer WS$_2$ encapsulated in hBN under the strong light-matter
coupling regime. We reveal formation of exciton-polaritons with $\sim 50$ meV
Rabi splitting and demonstrate a pump-induced transition from strong to weak
coupling. Our results show that exciton resonance saturation and broadening
lead to an efficient nonlinear response of guided polaritons, which can be
employed for developing compact van der Waals photonic switches and modulators.

Abstract: We develop a theory of two-dimensional Bloch-Landau-Zener (BLZ) oscillations
of wavepackets in incommensurate moir\'e lattices under the influence of a weak
linear gradient. Unlike periodic systems, aperiodic lattices lack translational
symmetry and therefore do not exhibit a conventional band-gap structure.
Instead, they feature a mobility edge, above which (in the optical context) all
modes become localized. When a linear gradient is applied to a moir\'e lattice,
it enables energy transfer between two or several localized modes, leading to
the oscillatory behavior referred to as BLZ oscillations. This phenomenon
represents simultaneous tunneling in real space and propagation constant
(energy) space, and it arises when quasi-resonance condition for propagation
constants and spatial proximity of interacting modes (together constituting a
selection rule) are met. The selection rule is controlled by the linear
gradient, whose amplitude and direction play a crucial role in determining the
coupling pathways and the resulting dynamics. We derive a multimode model
describing BLZ oscillations in the linear regime and analyze how both
attractive and repulsive nonlinearities affect their dynamics. The proposed
framework can be readily extended to other physical systems, including cold
atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates in aperiodic potentials.

TL;DR: Introducing the OCiC framework, which integrates ORCUs into optical communication to perform AI inference concurrently, achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per channel.

Motivation: The paper focuses on the challenges of intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical separation and compounded latency from serial processing of inference and communication are significant issues in medical AI and surgical robotics.

Method: The OCiC framework is developed by integrating Optical Remote Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, achieving spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution.

Result: The system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically mitigating cumulative error propagation.

Conclusion: The OCiC framework successfully addresses the limitations of conventional electronic AI architectures by leveraging optical communication for reduced latency and improved scalability in distributed photonic AI applications for telesurgery.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing
intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical
separation impairs sensory feedback and control. Despite advances in medical AI
and surgical robotics, conventional electronic AI architectures remain
fundamentally constrained by the compounded latency from serial processing of
inference and communication. This limitation is especially critical in
latency-sensitive procedures such as endovascular interventions, where delays
over 200 ms can compromise real-time AI reliability and patient safety. Here,
we introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that
reduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference
concurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote
Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with
each ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per
channel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The
system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines
on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically
mitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical
network scalability. We validated the robustness of OCiC through outdoor dark
fibre deployments, confirming consistent and stable performance across varying
environmental conditions. When scaled globally, OCiC transforms long-haul fibre
infrastructure into a distributed photonic AI fabric with exascale potential,
enabling reliable, low-latency telesurgery across distances up to 10,000 km and
opening a new optical frontier for distributed medical intelligence.

Motivation:  understanding fundamental quantum electrodynamics phenomena and potential metrology applications.

Conclusion:  The experiment aims to measure the vacuum's response to a magnetic field using advanced setups, with initial results showing potential for future enhancements.

Abstract: The vacuum magnetic birefringence effect is a prediction of quantum
electrodynamics, that in the presence of a magnetic field vacuum behaves as a
non-linear medium, exhibiting a birefringence. In this work, an experiment is
proposed to measure this effect for the first time, by sensing the changes in
the frequencies of laser fields stabilized to the resonances of a 245 m long
optical cavity whose eigenmode propagates through a string of 24
superconducting magnets arranged for the ALPS II experiment. Results from a

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: We propose a practical, chip-scale metasurface that achieves nonreciprocal optical response using ferrite nanoparticles with specific in-plane magnetic anisotropy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for compact, chip-scale, and polarization-insensitive nonreciprocal optical components that can handle unpolarized light, which is essential for various photonic applications.

Method: Experiments were conducted with in-plane ferrite nanodisks in a vortex state and symmetry-protected quasi-bound states. The method involved combining self-magnetization with a synthetic moving medium response in a monolithic structure.

Result: The metasurface exhibits pure synthetic moving-medium response at optical frequencies, resulting in giant nonreciprocal directional dichroism with near-unity transmittance contrast and emissivity-to-absorptivity ratios.

Conclusion: This work provides a feasible solution for compact nonreciprocal photonics, facilitating applications like photonic gyrators, nonreciprocal wavefront engineering, and nonreciprocal solar cells.

Abstract: Reciprocity breaking at optical frequencies typically relies on bulky
magnets, dynamic modulation, or nonlinearities, all of which hinder chip-scale
integration and the handling of unpolarised light. We introduce a fully
passive, subwavelength metasurface that achieves polarisation-insensitive
one-way transparency by combining self-magnetised ferrite nanodisks in a vortex
state with symmetry-protected quasi-bound states in the continuum. The
metasurface exhibits a pure synthetic moving-medium response at optical
frequencies, yielding giant nonreciprocal directional dichroism. We report
near-unity values for both the transmittance contrast and the
emissivity-to-absorptivity ratio with experimentally widely available ferrite
materials, all under unpolarised illumination and without external bias. Using
temporal coupled-mode theory, we identify the design conditions necessary to
maximise directional dichroism: critical coupling, Huygens-type resonance
overlap, and strong inter-mode coupling. Furthermore, we propose a
deterministic, stamp-assisted protocol for imprinting arbitrary, uniform, or
patterned vortex configurations across large arrays of nanodisk meta-atoms,
enabling scalable fabrication. This work establishes a practical route toward
compact nonreciprocal photonics with applications in photonic gyrators,
nonreciprocal wavefront engineering, and nonreciprocal solar cell technologies.

Abstract: Microorganisms are ubiquitous in nature, and microbial activities are closely
intertwined with the entire life cycle system and human life. Developing novel
technologies for the detection, characterization and manipulation of
microorganisms promotes their applications in clinical, environmental and
industrial areas. Over the last two decades, terahertz (THz) technology has
emerged as a new optical tool for microbiology. The great potential originates
from the unique advantages of THz waves including the high sensitivity to water
and inter-/intra-molecular motions, the non-invasive and label-free detecting
scheme, and their low photon energy. THz waves have been utilized as a stimulus
to alter microbial functions, or as a sensing approach for quantitative
measurement and qualitative differentiation. This review specifically focuses
on recent research progress of THz technology applied in the field of
microbiology, including two major parts of THz biological effects and the
microbial detection applications. In the end of this paper, we summarize the
research progress and discuss the challenges currently faced by THz technology
in microbiology, along with potential solutions. We also provide a perspective
on future development directions. This review aims to build a bridge between
THz photonics and microbiology, promoting both fundamental research and
application development in this interdisciplinary field.

Conclusion: 该研究通过元表面实现了量子霍尔效应并成功构建了量子图像，为量子信息处理和加密提供了新的框架和方法

Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of subwavelength nanostructures enable simultaneous
control of polarization and wavefront, greatly enhancing holographic
information capacity. Building on this capability, we extend holography into
the quantum domain by experimentally realizing Bell-state holograms-distinct
holographic images encoded in polarization-entangled Bell states of photon
pairs. A polarization-multiplexed dielectric metasurface generates spatial
modes conditioned on both input and output polarizations, entangling the
holographic pattern with the two-photon state. To characterize these quantum
holograms, we further develop quantum hologram tomography, reconstructing the
full density matrix of the holographic state pixel by pixel. The reconstructed
density-matrix hologram reveals tailor-made holographic symbols attached to
individual Bell states through the metasurface, with contrast built up among
the different Bell components as theory shows. This framework unifies
metasurface photonics with quantum-state reconstruction and provides a scalable
route toward high-dimensional quantum communication, encryption and information
processing based on holographically encoded quantum light.

TL;DR: All-perovskite tandem solar cells show promise, but nonradiative losses are a key factor in the voltage gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The article investigates the voltage gap issue in tandem solar cells, focusing on identifying and reducing nonradiative losses to improve efficiency.

Method: The authors use absolute electroluminescence hyperspectral imaging to map radiative efficiencies and combine this with electro-optical characterization and modeling to analyze subcell behavior.

Result: Narrow bandgap absorbers contribute more to the voltage gap and exhibit higher nonradiative recombination losses compared to wider bandgap absorbers.

Conclusion: Efforts should concentrate on reducing nonradiative recombination in narrow bandgap absorbers to alleviate the voltage gap in tandem solar cells.

Abstract: All-perovskite tandem solar cells with narrow and wide bandgap perovskite
absorbers are promising candidates for low-cost and high efficiency
photovoltaic applications. However, the open circuit voltage of typical tandem
structures is generally smaller than the sum of the individual voltages in the
single-junction form; a quantity we call the voltage gap. Subcell optimization
can only begin once nonradiative losses associated with each absorber layer can
be properly identified. To address this, we used absolute electroluminescence
hyperspectral imaging to construct external radiative efficiency maps of each
subcell within the tandem stack and compare these measurements with single
junction devices. These measurements were then combined with additional
electro-optical characterization and modeling to construct subcell current vs
voltage curves. We find that the narrow band gap subcell contributes the most
towards the voltage gap and therefore fabrication and processing efforts should
focus on reducing nonradiative recombination losses within the narrow band gap
absorber.

Abstract: The ability to control the spatial distribution of light, particularly in
deep sub-wavelength areas, is important for a range of materials science,
microscopy, and communications applications. Separately, materials science and
communications rely on the ability to temporally shape the evolution of
electromagnetic pulses. In this work we investigate theoretically the

funnels, which have been recently used to achieve deep subwavelength
(wavelength/30) concentration of monochromatic mid-infrared light. By analyzing
the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the pulse-funnel interaction, we show
that photonic funnels, in general, broaden bandwidth-limited ultrafast Gaussian
pulses. We demonstrate that this broadening can be mitigated by pre-chirping
the incoming light, realizing simultaneous intensity enhancement and
spatio-temporal compression of mid-wave IR light in the all-semiconductor
"designer metal" funnel platform. Our analysis suggests that, in combination
with linear chirp, designer-metal-based photonic funnels can be utilized with
100 fs bandwidth- and diffraction-limited pulses to produce wavelength/30-scale
signals of ~200 fs duration, with intensity enhancement on the order of 5.
Lowering material absorption can further enhance the peak intensity. The
results presented can be used to assess the perspectives of ultrafast
sub-diffraction light manipulation in other portions of the electromagnetic
spectrum by adjusting the (meta)material composition of the funnels.

Abstract: In this letter, we present the design and implementation of a 2-bit digaital

Abstract: Flying focus techniques produce laser pulses whose focal points travel at
arbitrary, controllable velocities. While this flexibility can enhance a broad
range of laser-based applications, existing techniques constrain the motion of
the focal point to the propagation direction of the pulse. Here, we introduce a
flying focus configuration that decouples the motion of the focus from the
propagation direction. A chirped laser pulse focused and diffracted by a
diffractive lens and grating creates a focal point that can move both along and
transverse to the propagation direction. The focal length of the lens, grating
period, and chirp can be tuned to control the direction and velocity of the
focus. Simulations demonstrate this control for a holographic configuration
suited to high-power pulses, in which two off-axis pump beams with different
focal lengths encode the equivalent phase of a chromatic lens and grating in a
gas or plasma. For low-power pulses, conventional solid-state or adaptive
optics can be used instead. Multi-dimensional control over the focal trajectory
enables new configurations for applications, including laser wakefield
acceleration of ions, steering of broadband THz radiation, and surface harmonic
generation.

Abstract: Artificial magnetic conductors (AMCs) mimic the idealized boundary condition
of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC), which reflects electromagnetic waves
with a preserved electric field and inverted magnetic field. Despite their
usefulness, existing AMC implementations often rely on complex or impractical
designs, and lack a clear electromagnetic theory explaining their behavior,
especially under oblique or polarization-diverse incidence. This work addresses
these limitations by presenting a rigorous electromagnetic framework for PMC
metasurfaces based on dipolar and quadrupolar surface susceptibilities within
the generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) formalism. We show that
achieving polarization- and angle-independent PMC behavior requires a specific
set of heteroanisotropic (nonlocal) susceptibilities, and we derive closed-form
expressions for angular scattering that include higher-order multipole
contributions. A physically realizable, asymmetric metasurface structure is
then designed to satisfy these theoretical conditions. Despite its geometric
asymmetry, the proposed structure exhibits a isotropic PMC response at
resonance, confirmed by full-wave simulations and multipolar susceptibility
extraction. These results demonstrate how properly engineered surface
multipoles can yield angularly independent magnetic boundary conditions using
only thin, passive metallic layers. This work bridges the gap between AMC
design and electromagnetic theory, and enables a new class of angle-independent
metasurface reflectors for more accurate simulations, optimizations and
innovative AMC designs.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the spiking dynamics of biological
neurons for brain-inspired computation. While electronic implementations of
artificial spiking neurons have dominated to date, photonic approaches are
attracting increasing research interest as they promise ultrafast,
energy-efficient operation with low-crosstalk and high bandwidth. Nevertheless,
existing photonic neurons largely mimic integrate-and-fire models, but
neuroscience shows that neurons also encode information through richer
mechanisms, such as the frequency and temporal patterns of spikes. Here, we
present a photonic-electronic resonate-and-fire (R-and-F) spiking neuron that
responds to the temporal structure of high-speed optical inputs. This is based
on a light-sensitive resonant tunnelling diode that produces excitable spikes
in response to nanosecond, low-power (100 microwatt) optical signals at
infrared telecom wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate control of R-and-F
dynamics through inter-pulse timing of the optical stimuli and applied bias
voltage, achieving bandpass filtering of both analogue and digital inputs. The
R-and-F neuron also supports optical fan-in via wavelength-division multiplexed
inputs from four vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs). This
electronic-photonic neuron exhibits key functionalities - including
spike-frequency filtering, temporal pattern recognition, and digital-to-spiking
conversion - critical for neuromorphic optical processing. Our approach
establishes a pathway toward low-power, high-speed temporal information
processing for light-enabled neuromorphic computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase retrieval is computationally expensive, limiting its use in large-scale imaging systems. Our work addresses this by proposing methods that reduce computational complexity without sacrificing performance.

Method: Structured random models are created by cascading structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. The model uses spectral initialization followed by gradient descent for robust reconstruction.

Result: Achieves reconstruction at an oversampling ratio of 2.8 with performance determined by singular value distribution. The models can be implemented with basic optical components, enabling large-scale imaging.

Conclusion: Establece una nueva aproximación para la recuperación de fases utilizando estructuras aleatorias con reducción de costos computacionales, con aplicaciones prácticas en microscopios optics y otros sistemas ppm imágen de grande escala con garantías de reconstrucción.

Abstract: Phase retrieval is a nonlinear inverse problem that arises in a wide range of
imaging modalities, from electron microscopy to optical Fourier ptychography.
Among various modalities, random phase retrieval stands out thanks to its
strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms, although
its applicability is hindered by prohibitive computational costs. In this
paper, we propose the structured random models for phase retrieval, where we
emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random
diagonal matrices. We demonstrate that structured random models can achieve the
same reconstruction performance as dense random models, with complexity reduced
from quadratic to log-linear. Using a spectral method initialization followed
by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio
as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is
solely determined by the singular value distribution of the forward matrix.
This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements
such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with
robust reconstruction guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the potential for advanced optical applications and overcoming the limitations of complex nanostructures.

Method: The method involves using microring resonators, microwave inputs, and Brillouin interaction between acoustic and optical modes to generate OAM beams.

Result: The approach achieves rapid reconfigurability, high radiation efficiency (over 25"), and the ability to synthesize complex OAM superposition states.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel technique for generating structured light, opening new avenues in optical device design without the need for intricate nanostructures.

Abstract: The integrated devices that generate structural optical fields with
non-trivial orbital angular momentums (OAMs) hold great potential for advanced
optical applications, but are restricted to complex nanostructures and static
functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable OAM beam generator from
a simple microring resonator without requiring grating-like nanostructures. Our
approach harnesses Brillouin interaction between confined phonon and optical
modes, where the acoustic field is excited through microwave input. The phonon
stimulate the conversion from a guided optical mode into a free-space vortex
beam. Under the selection rule of radiation, the OAM order of the emitted light
is determined by the acousto-optic phase matching and is rapidly reconfigurable
by simply tuning the microwave frequency. Furthermore, this all-microwave
control scheme allows for the synthesis of arbitrary high-dimensional OAM
superposition states by programming the amplitudes and phases of the driving
fields. Analytical and numerical models predict a radiation efficiency over
25\% for experimentally feasible on-chip microcavities. This work introduces a
novel paradigm for chip-to-free-space interfaces, replacing fixed nanophotonic
structures with programmable acousto-optic interactions for versatile
structured light generation.

Result: The experimental results show a strong agreement between simulations and measurements, successfully demonstrating the proposed technique for dispersion engineering.

Conclusion: The approach offers an efficient and general solution for dispersion engineering in integrated optical circuits, leveraging the high refractive index contrast and nonlinear properties of III-V semiconductors.

Abstract: Technological advances in the fabrication of nanophotonic circuits have
driven the scientific community to increasingly focus on the precise tailoring
of their key optical properties, over a broadband spectral domain. In this
context, the modulation of the local refractive index can be exploited to
customize an effective reflectivity by the use of distributed Bragg mirrors,
enabling the on-chip integration of Fabry-P\'erot resonators. The resulting
cavity length is strongly wavelength-dependent, offering practical solutions to
the growing demand of dispersion engineering. Owing to their typically high
core-to-cladding refractive index contrast and exceptional nonlinear
properties, III-V semiconductor-based platforms represent promising candidates
for the fabrication of Bragg reflectors. In this work, we propose an
AlGaAs-on-insulator linear resonator based on distributed Bragg mirrors. We
discuss the first experimental demonstration of a systematic, shape-constrained
inverse design technique which tailors a prescribed dispersion profile, showing
a strong agreement between simulations and measurements. In perspective, the
proposed approach offers an efficient and general response to the challenge of

Abstract: Non diffracting (ND) beams are often cited as a promising solution to
mitigate blockage in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. However, a quantitative
answer to the fundamental question, under what specific conditions do ND beams
actually outperform conventional pencil beams, has remained elusive, especially
in the emerging context of near-field communications. This paper provides the
first systematic answer by mapping the performance advantage regimes of ND
beams for blockage-resilient near-field links. We propose a unified holographic
generator that synthesizes various structured beams (e.g., Bessel, Mathieu)
under the physical constraints of a planar phased array, ensuring a fair
comparison against a boresight baseline with identical EIRP and aperture.
Through extensive, unbiased Monte Carlo simulations, we construct advantage
regime maps that delineate the specific regions where ND beams offer a tangible
link-level gain. Our key finding is that the advantage of ND beams is a
powerful but conditional near field phenomenon. While offering a positive
average gain, its performance is highly variable, with a 60-70% probability of
outperforming the baseline in its optimal range. Crucially, this performance is
strongly modulated by the obstacle's geometry, revealing a significant weakness
against large blockers. These findings provide not just a practical roadmap for
judiciously employing ND beams but also a clear motivation for future work in
environment-aware, adaptively shaped structured beams.

Abstract: Precise control of plasmonic resonances across a broad spectral range is

Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically

computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely
limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this
bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable
sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary
variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel
transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain,
revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive
acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables
admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient
exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately
reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$
algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock
time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a
long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work
provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens

Abstract: Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates
have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap
regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Chan et al., Nature Physics 10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key
distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as
fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin
density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where
$p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance
$\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both
states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band
Hamiltonian. While the SDW Yamaji azimuthal angle $\theta$ is marginally
smaller than the FL* Yamaji $\theta$, the most significant difference is the
presence of a second Yamaji peak in the SDW theory near in-plane angle $\phi =
45^\circ$; there is no such second peak in the observations in
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. Furthermore, we examine the role of anisotropic
interlayer hopping present in LSCO, and predict the potential emergence of the
Yamaji effect in LSCO at higher magnetic fields. Our results support the FL*
interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle
measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.

resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and
magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range
spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content,
indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of
the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The
Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly
enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier
concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering.
We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies,
and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to
increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW
picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.

TL;DR: The material Ba3MnTa2O9, a triple perovskite oxide, exhibits a quasi-2D Mn^2+ magnetic network without long-range magnetic order at low temperatures, suggesting geometric frustration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding geometric frustration in magnetic materials can provide insights into unconventional magnetic behavior, relevant for spintronics and quantum computing.

Method: The research utilized dc and ac magnetization, specific heat, ESR measurements, and DFT calculations to study magnetic ordering and frustration.

Result: Despite antiferromagnetic correlations, no long-range magnetic order was observed at low temperatures, indicating geometric frustration, which was supported by entropy release analysis and DFT calculations.

Conclusion: The material exhibits unconventional magnetic behavior, likely due to geometric frustration in a quasi-2D Mn^2+ network, which could lead to exploratory applications in quantum systems.

Abstract: A triple perovskite oxide Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$ has been synthesized and
its magnetic properties have been investigated through dc and ac magnetization,
specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mn$^{2+}$ ($S$ = 5/2) ions are the only
magnetic species present in the material. These Mn$^{2+}$ ions constitute a
quasi-two-dimensional triangular network in the crystallographic $ab$-plane.
Magnetization and specific heat measurements reveal the absence of any
long-range magnetic order down to 0.5\,K despite the presence of
antiferromagnetic correlations between the magnetic ions, suggesting the
presence of geometric frustration in the material. The entropy release is lower
than the expected theoretical value of $Rln(6)$, further suggesting the
presence of frustration. First-principles calculations using density functional
theory (DFT) and atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations further support this
lack of static magnetic order even at low temperatures and identify the
competing magnetic interactions along with the quasi-2D magnetic dimensionality
as the underlying origin of such an unconventional magnetic behavior.

Abstract: We study the $S=1/2$ square-kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with

degrees of freedom. We find that, within the first-order perturbation theory
with respect to the inter-trimer coupling, the effective Hamiltonian is the
Kugel-Khomskii-type model on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Based on a
mean-field decoupling, we propose a dimer-covering ansatz for the effective
Hamiltonian; however, the validity of these states in the low-energy sector
remains an open question.

Abstract: Recent experiment on Fe-doped CoSn has uncovered a series of correlated
phases upon hole doping of the kagome flat bands. Among the phases observed, a
nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to
prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these
observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome
model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density
interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close
competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent
Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the
sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping
window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also
considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of
partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for
understanding correlated flat-band phases.

Conclusion: 扩展了对FCIs的理解，挑战了只有Chern带才能形成非Abelian多态物的观念。

Abstract: The rapid advances in the study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) raise a
fundamental question: while initially discovered in flat Chern bands motivated
by their topological equivalence to Landau levels, is single- particle band
topology actually a prerequisite for these many-body topological orders
emergent at fractional fillings? Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs
in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact
diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a
gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at
half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down
to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a
non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\nu$ = 1
filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice
parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we
also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where
onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI
forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and
Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively
uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for
(non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the
Chern band paradigm.

Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum
entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments
on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to
understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing
on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional
quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent
photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which
is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show
that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal
characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the
global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the
ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as
two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI
shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the
classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss
our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing
experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results
demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also
be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of
quantum magnets.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新方法，用于通过量子相动学来表征Mott相的量子相态。

Abstract: Using Mott insulators as a prototypical example, we demonstrate a
dynamics-based characterization of quantum phases of matter through a general
N-body renormalization group framework. The essential "Mott-ness" turns out to
be characterized by a change of size-scaling of the effective intra- momentum
repulsions between long-lived emergent "eigen-particles" that encodes the
dynamics of two-body bound states in the high-energy sector. This directly
offers a universal characterization at long space-time scale for the
corresponding class of Mott insulators through a uniform single occupation of
all momenta, and otherwise Mott metals. This universal description naturally
paves the way to topological Mott insulators and is straightforward to extend
to bosonic Mott systems. More generally, this demonstration exemplifies a
generic paradigm of characterizing quantum phases of matter through their
distinct dynamics beyond broken symmetries.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how rotations negatively affect atom interferometers used in space-based gravity measurements, achieving better than 90% recovery of interference contrast through counter-rotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise inertial measurements in challenging space environments like satellites leads to exploring ways to mitigate the negative effects of rotation on interferometers.

Method: The researchers developed an analytical model and conducted experiments using a space-grade proof-mass accelerometer as a retro-reflection mirror in a cold atom gravimeter setup, employing counter-rotation techniques to address the issue.

Result: By counter-rotating the proof-mass, they successfully restored near-perfect interference contrast even when rotations were present, whether at constant angular velocities or with angular accelerations.

Conclusion: This method enables high-performance inertial measurements with atom interferometers even in environments with significant rotation, paving the way for their use in advanced space applications.

Abstract: Rotations play a detrimental role in achieving ultra-high-performance
inertial measurements with an atom interferometer, leading potentially to a
total loss of interference contrast and the emergence of dominant phase shift
biases. This becomes particularly significant when considering operation in
dynamic conditions such as those encountered in Earth orbiting satellites in
the perspective of future space gravity missions on-boarding a cold atom
accelerometer. We study in this context the impact of rotation on the phase
shift and contrast of an atom interferometer and investigate mitigation
strategies. An analytical model is derived and compared to experimental
demonstrations carried out using an original setup in which the well-controlled
proof-mass of a space electrostatic accelerometer is used as the
retro-reflection mirror of a cold atom gravimeter. By properly counter-rotating
the electrostatic proof-mass, we demonstrate for instance the possibility of
recovering the interferometer contrast, otherwise equal to zero, to a level
better than 90%, in both cases of constant angular velocities or in presence of
angular accelerations. Our results demonstrate the possibility to perform high
performance inertial measurements with a cold atom interferometer in a
challenging environments.

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper investigates asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves in the DNLS equation, showing that modulation instability leads to specific patterns of oscillations in energy moments, wave-action spectrum, auto-correlation, and wave intensity probability distribution. The turbulence is asymmetric due to wave number differences between the plane wave and perturbation. Rogue waves occur more frequently during MI's early nonlinear phase when potential energy is minimized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of rogue waves and modulation instability in nonlinear systems like the DNLS equation is essential for predicting and mitigating their impact in optics and other physical settings.

Method: The study numerically simulates the DNLS equation, analyzing various statistical measures of the wave field over time and space.

Result: The turbulence exhibits asymmetric characteristics, with specific oscillation patterns in key metrics, and rogue wave occurrences increase during the early nonlinear phase of MI.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the dynamics of asymmetric integrable turbulence, particularly regarding rogue wave generation, which is valuable for applications in wave physics and nonlinear optics.

Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric integrable turbulence and rogue waves (RWs)
emerging from the modulation instability (MI) of plane waves for the DNLS
equation. The \(n\)-th moments and ensemble-averaged kinetic and potential
energy exhibit oscillatory convergence towards their steady-state values.
Specifically, the amplitudes of oscillations for these indexes decay
asymptotically with time as \(t^{-1.36}\), while the phase shifts demonstrate a
nonlinear decay with a rate of \(t^{-0.78}\). The frequency of these
oscillations is observed to be twice the maximum growth rate of MI. These
oscillations can be classified into two distinct types: one is in phase with
ensemble-averaged potential energy modulus $|\langle H_4\rangle|$, and the
other is anti-phase. At the same time, this unity is also reflected in the
wave-action spectrum \( S_k(t) \) for a given \( k \), the auto-correlation
function \( g(x,t) \) for a given \( x \), as well as the PDF \( P(I,t) \). The
critical feature of the turbulence is the wave-action spectrum, which follows a
power-law distribution of \( |k+3|^{-\alpha} \) expect for $k=-3$. Unlike the
NLS equation, the turbulence in the DNLS setting is asymmetric, primarily due
to the asymmetry between the wave number of the plane wave from the MI and the
perturbation wave number.. As the asymptotic peak value of \( S_k \) is
observed at \( k = -3 \), the auto-correlation function exhibits a nonzero
level as \( x \to \pm L/2 \). The PDF of the wave intensity asymptotically
approaches the exponential distribution in an oscillatory manner. However,
during the initial stage of the nonlinear phase, MI slightly increases the
occurrence of RWs. This happens at the moments when the potential modulus is at
its minimum, where the probability of RWs occurring in the range of \( I\in
[12, 15] \) is significantly higher than in the asymptotic steady state.

Abstract: Tensor networks prepare states that share many features of states in quantum
gravity. However, standard constructions are not diffeomorphism invariant and
do not support an algebra of non-commuting area operators. Recently, analogues
of both problems were addressed in a tensor network discretization of
topological field theories (TFT) with finite or compact gauge groups. Here, we
extend this work towards gravity by generalizing to gauge groups that are
discrete or continuous, compact or non-compact. Applied to
$\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \times \text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory,
our construction can be interpreted as building states of three dimensional
gravity with a negative cosmological constant. Our tensor networks prepare
states that satisfy the constraints of Chern-Simons theory. In metric
variables, this implies that the states we construct satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation and momentum constraints, and so are diffeomorphism invariant.

Abstract: The restricted quantum focusing conjecture (rQFC) plays a central role in an
axiomatic formulation of semiclassical gravity. Since much hinges on its
validity, it is imperative to subject the rQFC to rigorous tests in novel
settings. Here we do so in two independent directions. First, we prove rQFC in
a class of spacetime dimension $d=2$ toy models, JT gravity coupled to a QFT.
We also construct explicit counter-examples to the original and stronger
Quantum Focusing Conjecture in a regime where matter quantum effects are
comparable to the total dilaton value. Second, for $d>2$, we derive a new CFT
constraint: the coincident limit of the product of two averaged null energy
operators in any CFT cannot be zero. Equivalently, the rQFC imposes an upper
bound of $2d-1$ on the scaling dimension of the leading even-spin Regge
trajectory, analytically continued in $J$ and evaluated at $J=3$. The bound
holds in free and weakly-interacting CFTs, and is saturated by the double-trace
trajectories in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills at strong coupling. We
speculate about a strengthened Quantum Null Energy Condition that would imply
our results.

Abstract: We study quenched disorder localized on a $p$-dimensional subspacetime in a

often associated with disorder, we introduce a defect setup in which bulk local
operators transform in ordinary conformal representations, while defect local
operators assemble into logarithmic multiplets. We refer to such objects as
logarithmic defects and investigate their model-independent properties dictated
solely by conformal symmetry and its representation theory, including
correlation functions, logarithmic defect operator expansions, and conformal
blocks. As a concrete example, we analyze the free scalar theory with a
generalized pinning defect subject to random coupling fluctuations, and we
identify a half-line of fixed points describing the corresponding logarithmic
conformal defects. Along the way, we propose a candidate monotone governing
defect renormalization group flows induced by subdimensional disorder. We
comment on various generalizations and the broader program of bootstrapping
logarithmic defects.

Motivation: Cosmology and general relativity seeking to understand the universe's structure and singularities.

Method: Mathematical proof involving spacetime geometries, energy conditions, and Friedmann equations.

Result: Incompatibility of flat/open non-static universes with nonsingular, geodesically complete spacetimes without violating ANEC, contrasted with closed universes accommodating such solutions.

Conclusion: The results challenge conventional cosmological models and prompt deeper exploration of spatial curvature's role in dark energy and cosmic structure.

Abstract: We establish a new no-go theorem for cosmology: spatially flat (k=0) and open
(k=-1) Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) non-static spacetimes cannot be
simultaneously nonsingular, geodesically complete, and consistent with the
averaged null energy condition (ANEC). Equivalently, any dynamic flat or open
universe that is complete must violate the ANEC. By contrast, closed universes
(k=+1) uniquely admit nonsingular, geodesically complete, ANEC-consistent
solutions, with global de Sitter space as the canonical realization that
saturates the ANEC. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that positive
spatial curvature naturally mimics the phenomenology of phantom dark energy
(w<-1), biasing flat-model reconstructions of w(z) at the 1% level. These
results sharpen the classical singularity theorems, establish a new
classification of eternal cosmologies, and motivate renewed scrutiny of spatial
curvature in both theory and observation.

top-down microscopic realization of holographic complexity in a cosmological
spacetime. Our identification is different from the existing holographic
complexity proposals for de Sitter geometries which are anchored either on
horizons as holographic screens or on timelike observers. This leads us to
introduce and investigate a new cosmological holographic complexity proposal in
any dimension. It is based on extremal timelike volumes anchored at the
asymptotic past and future and at large values of the anchoring boundary
coordinate grows linearly with growth rate proportional to the product of de
Sitter entropy and temperature.

Abstract: We show that both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories admit configurations
in which the fields behave as if in the presence of static charge densities, or
``shadow charges". These correspond to nontrivial initial conditions for the
fields that generate gauge transformations, the Gauss' law operators. In
non-abelian theories, such configurations seem to demand additional physical
fields with exactly static charge densities. In contrast with this expectation,
we show that gauge theory alone provides a consistent and gauge-invariant
description of shadow charges. Canonical quantization then yields continuous
shadow charges for abelian theories and quantized ones for non-abelian
theories. In general, our findings indicate that all local conservation laws
give rise to gauge symmetries, even in the presence of second-class

Abstract: We develop a geometric framework in Feynman-parameter space to determine
constraints on the sequential discontinuities of Feynman integrals. Our method
is based on tracking the deformation of the integration contour as external
kinematics are analytically continued. This procedure imposes powerful
constraints on the analytic structure of Feynman integrals, providing crucial
inputs for their bootstrap. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by
applying it to integrals in dimensional regularization, with higher propagator
powers, and to examples with non-uniform transcendental weight. The method is
illustrated with several one- and two-loop calculations.

### [50] [On $β$-function of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric integrable sigma models II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14148)
*Mikhail Alfimov,Andrey Kurakin*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores the regularization scheme dependence in N=2 supersymmetric sigma models, extending the previous four-loop β function result to five loops. A renormalization scheme is identified where the fifth-loop contribution vanishes, while the fourth-loop term is represented by a coordinate-independent invariant for specific metrics. These metrics are related to T-duals of η-deformed SU(n)/U(n−1) models and η- and λ-deformed SU(2)/U(1) models, which satisfy the fifth-loop RG flow equation. The discussion also covers the five-loop behavior in λ-deformed SU(2)/U(1) and SU(3)/U(2) models, emphasizing their Kähler structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supersymmetric sigma models are a significant area in theoretical physics, particularly in understanding the dynamics of quantum fields and string theory. Regularization scheme dependence can affect the renormalization group (RG) flow, making it crucial to identify schemes where such dependencies cancel out or simplify.

Method: The authors use a combination of perturbative renormalization group techniques and algebraic topology methods to analyze the beta functions and RG flow of the models. They derive the renormalization conditions and identify specific metrics where certain terms vanish.

Result: The key findings are: a) A five-loop renormalization scheme where the fifth-loop contribution to the β function disappears, b) The presence of specific invariants at the fourth loop level in certain metrics, and c) The demonstration that η- and λ-deformed models, along with their T-dual counterparts, satisfy the RG flow equation up to the fifth loop order. Additionally, the analysis provides insights into the Kähler structures of these models.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of RG flow in supersymmetric sigma models by identifying a five-loop scheme where the β function's fifth-loop term vanishes. It highlights the role of coordination-independent invariants and provides a deeper insight into the geometric properties of η- and λ-deformed models, which may have implications for string theory and integrable systems.

Abstract: We continue studying regularization scheme dependence of the $\mathcal{N}=2$
supersymmetric sigma models. In the present work the previous result for the
four loop $\beta$-function is extended to the five loop order. Namely, we find
the renormalization scheme, in which the fifth loop contribution is completely
eliminated, while the fourth loop contribution is represented by the certain
invariant, which is coordinate independent for the metrics of some models.
These models include complete $T$-duals of the $\eta$-deformed $SU(n)/U(n-1)$
models, as well as $\eta$- and $\lambda$-deformed $SU(2)/U(1)$ models, whose
metrics solve the RG flow equation up to the fifth loop order. We also comment
on the $\lambda$-deformed $SU(2)/U(1)$ and $SU(3)/U(2)$ case, showing that they
satisfy five-loop RG flow equation, and discuss their K\"ahler structure.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It has been known for many years that, in Yang-Mills theories with
$\mathcal{N}=4,2,2^*$ supersymmetry, certain nontrivial supersymmetric Wilson
loops exist with v.e.v. either trivial or computable by localization that
arises from a cohomological field theory, which also computes the
nonperturbative prepotential in $\mathcal{N}=2,2^*$ theories. Moreover, some
years ago it has been argued that, in analogy with the supersymmetric case,
certain nontrivial twistor Wilson loops with trivial v.e.v. to the leading
large-$N$ order exist in pure SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and are computed, to
the leading large-$N$ order, by a topological field/string theory that, to the
next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order, conjecturally captures nonperturbative
information on the glueball spectrum and glueball one-loop effective action as
well. In fact, independently of the above, it has also been claimed that "every
gauge theory with a mass gap should contain a possibly trivial topological
field theory in the infrared", so that the aforementioned twistor Wilson loops
realize a stronger version of this idea, as they have trivial v.e.v. at all
energy scales and not only in the infrared. In the present paper, we provide a
detailed proof of the triviality of the v.e.v. of twistor Wilson loops at the
leading large-$N$ order in Yang-Mills theory that has previously been only
sketched, opening the way to further developments.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Two different partially broken versions of higher-spin models are shown to maintain unitarity but differ in their propagating modes and interaction terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of higher-spin particles and their interactions is crucial in theoretical physics, particularly in constructing consistent models for quantum gravity and unified field theories.

Method: The analysis proceeds by comparing the propagating modes and unitarity of two models: the partially broken Skvortsov-Vasiliev (SV) and Fronsdal models for spins s=3 and s=4.

Result: Both models maintain unitarity but differ in their propagating modes and interaction terms; the SV model restricts to certain helicities, while the Fronsdal model's propagating modes are distinct.

Conclusion: The two models maintain unitarity but differ in their propagating modes and non-equivalence in interaction terms.

Abstract: Here we suggest a partially broken version of the Skvortsov-Vasiliev (SV)
model for massless particles of arbitrary integer spin $s\ge 3$. The traceless
gauge parameter of the Weyl transformation is now required to be transverse. In
the light-cone gauge we offer a simple proof that the model contains only
spin-$s$ helicities as propagating modes. In the $s=3$ and $s=4$ cases we are
able to calculate the two point amplitude and confirm unitarity in a explicitly
Lorentz invariant way.
  For the recently suggested partially broken Fronsdal model, for $s=3$ and
$s=4$, unitarity is also confirmed in a Lorentz invariant way from their two
point amplitudes. In both Fronsdal and SV partially broken models the two point
amplitudes differ from their unbroken counterparts by contact terms which
guarantees the same particle content but indicates potential non-equivalence of
possible interacting terms.

Abstract: We formulate a stochastic generalisation of the Schwinger effect, extending
pair production to statistically fluctuating gauge-field backgrounds. Our
approach captures realistic field configurations that are transient,
inhomogeneous, and stochastic, as commonly encountered in cosmological and
high-energy astrophysical settings. Using the effective action formalism, we
compute the vacuum decay rate and number density of charged particles,
obtaining closed-form analytical expressions for both scalar and fermionic
cases. To isolate the essential physics, the analysis is performed in flat
spacetime and at zero temperature, providing a controlled setting in which
curvature and thermal effects can be neglected. As a proof of concept, we
present representative phenomenological examples relevant to astrophysical
plasmas and early-Universe-motivated scenarios.

Abstract: The tt*-equation (topological-anti-topological fusion equation) was
introduced by S. Cecotti and C. Vafa for describing massive deformation of
supersymmetric conformal field theories. B. Dubrovin formulated the
tt*-equation as a flat bundle, called tt*-structure. In this paper, we
construct a tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian of
complex \(k\)-plane and obtain global solutions to the tt*-equation, following
the idea of Bourdeau. We give a precise mathematical formulation and a
description of the solutions by using p.d.e. theory and the harmonic map theory
developed by J. Dorfmeister, F. Pedit and H. Wu (the DPW method). Furthermore,
we give an isomorphism between tt*-structure for the \(k\)-th exterior product
of tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the complex projective space and
the tt*-structure for the quantum cohomology of the Grassmannian.

Abstract: Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges
possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this
correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs
branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive
effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though
progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane
configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based
algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing
algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver
Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that
circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine
the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror
pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d
mirror pairs.

Abstract: We prove the internal inconsistency of the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model.
Our proof is based on three assumptions. The first assumption is that in the
full theory the structure of counter temcs coincides with the structure of the
counter terms in the perturbation theory. The second assumption is the
positivity of norm states - no ghosts in the spectrum of the model. The third
assumption is that the canonical commutation relations among generalized
coordinates and momenta are valid in renormalized theory. The obtained results
mean that there are negative norm states in the spectrum of the WZ model.

Abstract: We show that the 't Hooft anomaly of a quantum field theory with continuous
flavor symmetry can be detected from rearrangements of the topological defect
webs implementing the global symmetry in general spacetime dimension, which is
concretized in 2D by the F-moves of the defect lines. Via dualizing the defects
to flat background gauge field configurations, we characterize the 't Hooft
anomaly by various cohomological data of the symmetry group, where the
cohomology of Lie groups with discrete topology plays the central role. We find
that an extra dimension emerges naturally as a consequence of the mathematical
description of the 't Hooft anomaly in the case of flat gauging.

Abstract: We investigate Krylov state complexity as a probe of the quantum Mpemba
effect in quantum spin chains. For models without global $U(1)$ symmetry,
Krylov complexity exhibits clear Mpemba-like crossings, consistent with
conventional diagnostics such as the trace distance, while offering a
complementary interpretation in terms of Hilbert-space exploration and
dynamical delocalization. In $U(1)$-symmetric systems, we confirm that the
recently proposed symmetric component of Krylov complexity serves as a robust
and reliable indicator of the QME, capturing anomalous relaxation even in cases
where the total complexity fails to do so.

Abstract: We consider the quantitative description of a many-particle gas of
interacting abelian anyons in the plane, confined in a trapping potential. If
the anyons are modeled as bosons with a magnetic flux attachment, and if the
total magnetic flux is small compared to the number of particles, then an
average-field description becomes appropriate for the low-energy collective
state of the gas. Namely, by means of a Hartree-Jastrow ansatz, we derive a
two-parameter Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger energy functional which extends the
well-known Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger density functional theory
to the magnetic (anyonic) self-interaction. One parameter determines the total
number of self-generated magnetic flux units in the system, and the other the
effective strength of spin-orbit self-interaction. This latter interaction can
be either attractive/focusing or repulsive/defocusing, and depends both on the
intrinsic spin-orbit interaction and the relative length scale of the flux
profile of the anyons. Densities and energies of ground and excited states are
studied analytically and numerically for a wide range of the parameters and
align well with a sequence of exact nonlinear Landau levels describing
Jackiw-Pi self-dual solitons. With increasing flux, counter-rotating vortices
are formed, enhancing the stability of the gas against collapse. Apart from
clarifying the relations between various different anyon models that have
appeared in the literature, our analysis sheds considerable new light on the
many-anyon spectral problem, and also exemplifies a novel
supersymmetry-breaking phenomenon.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to optimize the magnetic field sensitivity of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ quantum sensors by tailoring the production of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres in hBN nanoflakes through FIB irradiation.

Method: The study employed a combination of photoluminescence spectroscopy, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), and Raman spectroscopy to investigate the key parameters influencing $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ quantum sensors.

Result: The research demonstrates that $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin properties and hBN lattice parameters remain largely preserved up to an ion fluence of $10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, with significant degradation occurring beyond this dose. At an optimal implantation dose, a high AC magnetic sensitivity of $	ext{1 }	ext{μT}/	ext{√Hz} is achieved.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of carefully selecting fabrication parameters to enhance and localize $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres and their lattice for advanced quantum sensing applications based on 2D materials.

Abstract: We study $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres generated by helium focused ion beam
(FIB) irradiation in thin ($\sim$70 nm) hBN nanoflakes, in order to investigate
the effect of implantation conditions on the key parameters that influence the
magnetic field sensitivity of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ quantum sensors. Using a
combination of photoluminescence, optically detected magnetic resonance, and
Raman spectroscopy, we examine the competing factors of maximising signal
intensity through larger $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ concentration against the
degradation in spin coherence and lattice quality observed at high ion
fluences. Our results indicate that both the $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ spin properties
and hBN lattice parameters are largely preserved up to an ion fluence of
$10^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$, and beyond this significant degradation occurs in both.
At the optimal implantation dose, an AC magnetic sensitivity of $\sim
1\,\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ is achieved. Using the patterned
implantation enabled by the FIB, we find that $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres and
the associated lattice damage are well localised to the implanted regions. This
work demonstrates how careful selection of fabrication parameters can be used
to optimise the properties of $V_{\mathrm{B}}^-$ centres in hBN, supporting
their application as quantum sensors based on 2D materials.

Conclusion:  The research provides valuable insights for applying the proposed method in mobile communications and radar detection, highlighting its potential for practical implementation.  

Abstract: To address the issue of beam collapse resulting from instantaneous
instability during switch transitions in beam tracking, this paper proposes a
novel beam switching method based on a row-by-row switching code table. The
paper first establishes an abstract model of the beam tracking application
scenario and introduces the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) employed
in this paper. Subsequently, simulations are conducted to compare the
conventional direct beam switching method with the proposed row-by-row
switching code table approach, thereby elucidating the advantages and
limitations of the new method. In parallel, a RIS hardware platform is
constructed in a microwave anechoic chamber for experimental validation. Both
simulation and experimental results show that, by incorporating intermediate
state transitions, the approach achieves beam tracking without beam collapse
while incurring no significant gain loss. Finally, the paper discusses the
applicability scope and potential scenarios for the proposed method. This
research provides valuable insights for applications in mobile communications
and radar detection.

Abstract: An accurate design of a ground-coupled heat pump system requires the
knowledge of the outlet fluid temperature from the borehole heat exchangers
(BHEs), both in the short and long term. This paper fucuses on the short and
medium term. In this time range, either 3D finite-element simulations or
Thermal Resistance Capacity Models (TRCMs) can be applied. The former can yield
very accurate results but require long computation times. The latter are much
faster but cannot be fully precise, because they require simplifying
assumptions. In this paper, we present a new method for the short-term and
medium-term simulation of single U-tube BHEs, which combines the speed of TRCMs
and the accuracy of finite-elements simulations. The method uses a TRCM to
estimate the thermal response of the BHE, then corrects the results by
interpolation with a dataset, which has been produced by running 54
finite-element simulations in various configurations. The model is implemented
in a C++ program, available at the open-source online data repository of the
University of Bologna. The program provides, within two seconds, the time
evolution of the inlet, outlet and mean fluid temperature, of the mean BHE
surface temperature, of the 3D and the effective borehole thermal resistance.
It can be easily connected to long-term simulation tools to obtain the
full-time-scale thermal response of a bore field.

Motivation: The study aims to explore the potential of bi-metallic systems in plasmonics, particularly for advanced applications such as biomolecule detection, by combining different metals in a controlled manner.

Method: The research employs a dry-synthesis method to fabricate bilayers of various metals, followed by morphological analysis, numerical modeling, and optical spectroscopy.

Result: The study successfully demonstrates the formation of bi-metallic nanoporous structures and observes their optical properties, which could be useful for sensing applications.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for designing plasmonic devices using bi-metallic nanoporous platforms with tailored electronic and optical properties.

Abstract: Nanoporous metals are extensively investigated as platforms for applications
in plasmonics. They present high surface areas and strong local electric fields
that can be tuned at different energies, playing with the choice of the metals
and the morphology of the porous layers. Until recently, research in the field
of plasmonics has primarily focused on porous metals composed of a single
element, with limited attention given to the impact of alloy composition. The
investigation of bi-metallic systems has only just begun to emerge in the
literature. In particular, combining two or more different plasmonic metals, it
could be possible to explore the interactions between two metals excited at
specific energies. This involves plasmonic coupling, electron transfer, band
hybridization at the interface, electromagnetic field interactions, and
possibly thermal and electronic energy transfer depending on separation, size,
and materials involved. The analysis of bi-metal systems can also be
interesting in biomolecule detection, such as in the case of Surface Enhanced
Raman Scattering (SERS). Here we report, for the first time, a detailed study
(comprising morphological analyses, numerical modelling, and optical
spectroscopies) on bi-metal nanoporous platforms prepared with a dry-synthesis
method enabling the easy and controllable fabrication of bilayers combining
different metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu.

Abstract: Electro-momentum coupling in piezoelectric metamaterials with broken
inversion symmetry enables asymmetric elastic wave transport by linking
macroscopic electric fields to momentum, an effect analogous to Willis coupling
in elastic media. A one-dimensional layered piezoelectric metamaterial
integrated with shunt circuits, consisting of a resistor, inductor, and
strain-proportional voltage feedback gain, is proposed to achieve dynamic
control of frequency-dependent stiffness and damping through electromechanical
interactions. Tuning the circuit parameters yields direction-dependent wave
scattering at targeted frequencies. Dynamic homogenization reveals macroscopic
constitutive relations exhibiting both Willis and electro-momentum couplings.
Non-Hermitian exceptional points are identified, where scattering eigenmodes
coalesce and produce extreme asymmetries in wave response. Near these points,
the system realizes unidirectional zero reflection (UZR) and unidirectional
perfect absorption (UPA), achieving complete absorption from one direction and
total reflection from the opposite side. The findings demonstrate a compact and
reconfigurable platform for tunable, directional elastic wave control using
passive-active hybrid metamaterials, opening new avenues for programmable
devices in acoustic isolation, wave-based computing, sensing, and energy
manipulation in solid media.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a unified framework that fully represents electromagnetic
potentials, fields, and sources in vacuum, based on a reinterpretation of the
classical Hertz-potential formalism. In this construction, $\phi$, $A$, $E$,
$B$, $\rho$, and $J$ are systematically derived from a single vector wavefield
$\Gamma(x, t)$ (called the "$\Gamma$-potential"), which is structurally aligned
with the classical electric Hertz potential but of broader scope. A surjective
mapping is established from such wavefields to all electromagnetic
configurations in vacuum (that are sufficiently regular). This mapping induces
a well-defined algebraic correspondence between the solution space of Maxwell's
equations and the linear space of $C_t^{3} C_x^{3}$ vector wavefields (modulo
the relevant symmetries), thereby enabling a framework for structural analysis
of electromagnetic fields via their associated wavefields. Gauge freedom and
the Lorenz gauge are naturally preserved; charge conservation and Maxwell's
equations are inherently encoded in this representation.
  Building on this framework, we also introduce a transformation that provides
a systematic method for generating new electromagnetic solutions from known
ones. This transformation, called the "$\Gamma$-transformation", generalizes
classical gauge transformations and may facilitate the exploration of hidden
structures and symmetries in the solution space of Maxwell's equations.

Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental
mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at
different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the
electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different
configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by
an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent
behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge
long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been
considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we
turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum
fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.

Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the spread complexity in the Krylov
space of quantum systems driven across a quantum phase transition. Using the
diabatic Magnus expansion, we map the evolution to an effective one-dimensional
hopping model. For the transverse field Ising model, we establish an exact link
between the growth of complexity and the Kibble-Zurek defect scaling: all
cumulants of complexity exhibit the same power-law scaling as the defect
density, with coefficients identical to the mean, and the full distribution
asymptotically becomes Gaussian. These results yield general scaling arguments
for the growth of complexity across arbitrary second-order quantum phase
transitions.

Abstract: We investigate how non-stabilizer resources enable the emergence of quantum
state designs within the projected ensemble. Starting from initial states with
finite magic and applying resource-free Clifford circuits to scramble them, we
analyze the ensemble generated by performing projective Pauli measurements on a
subsystem of the final state. Using both analytical arguments and large-scale
numerics, we show that the projected ensemble converges towards a state
$k$-design with an error that decays exponentially with the $k$-th Stabilizer
Renyi Entropy of the pre-measurement state, via a Magic-Induced Design Ansatz
(MIDA) that we introduce. We identify a universal scaling form, valid across
different classes of magic initial states, and corroborate it through numerical
simulations and analytical calculations of the frame potential. For
finite-depth Clifford unitaries, we show that the timescales at which state
designs emerge are controlled by the transport of magic. We identify a ``magic
teleportation'' mechanism whereby non-Clifford resources injected locally
spread through Clifford scrambling and measurements across distances beyond the
lightcone. Our results demonstrate how a small and controlled amount of magic
suffices to generate highly random states, providing a systematic route toward
generating quantum state designs in early fault-tolerant devices.

Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can host non-equilibrium phenomena
without static analogs, including in their entanglement dynamics. Here, we
discover $temporal$ $entanglement$ $transitions$ in a Floquet spin chain, which
correspond to a quantum phase transition in the spectrum of the entanglement
Hamiltonian and are signaled by dynamical spontaneous symmetry breaking. We
show that these transitions are entanglement-driven, i.e., they require
initially entangled states and remain invisible to conventional local
observables. Intriguingly, we find these transitions across a broad range of
driving frequencies (from adiabatic to high-frequency regime) and independently
of drive details, where they manifest as periodic, sharp entanglement spectrum
reorganizations marked by the Schmidt-gap closure, a vanishing entanglement
echo, and symmetry-quantum-number flips. At high frequencies, the entanglement
Hamiltonian acquires an intrinsic timescale decoupled from the drive period,
rendering the transitions genuine steady-state features. Finite-size scaling
reveals universal critical behavior with correlation-length exponent $\nu=1$,
matching equilibrium Ising universality despite its emergence from purely
dynamical mechanisms decoupled from static criticality. Our work establishes
temporal entanglement transitions as novel features in Floquet quantum matter.

Abstract: We investigate the estimation sensitivity of gravitational acceleration using
squeezed probe states within a quantum metrology framework. In particular, we
analyze how the squeezing phase, beyond its amplitudes, of the probes affects
the attainable precision. We find that probes squeezed along the canonical
phase-space quadrature can fail to achieve a quantum Fisher information (QFI)
surpassing the shot-noise limit, regardless of the interaction time with the
gravitational field. In contrast, position-momentum correlated input states
with the squeezing amplitude can overcome this limit. Furthermore, we show that
optimal sensitivity is attained through projective momentum measurements
combined with a time-dependent adjustment of the squeezing phase. Our results
are important to highlight the fundamental role of phase-engineered squeezing
in experimental gravimetry protocols.

Conclusion: 研究结果支持了通过开放量子系统的研究来理解孤立量子体系中的散逸现象，并且在不同物理条件下，两者之间的对应关系依然存在，进一步巩固了李乌夫量子量分析的适用性。这些发现为量子散逸的研究提供了一个新的视角。

Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in
quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body
systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by
Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical
limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the
Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the
slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study
the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of
the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic
gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between
integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a
unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed
many-body quantum systems.

Motivation:  Quantum measurements beyond standard framework. Understanding measuring devices that don't adhere to orthogonal projection postulate.

Method:  Uses advanced mathematical techniques like c^* -algebras and kolmogorov equations.

Result:  Mathematical framework (IGA) unifying measurement dynamics of time-dependent quantum systems.

Conclusion:  Fundamental structure (IGA) for continuous measurement theory, with potential applications in quantum info theory.

Abstract: Many of the most fundamental observables | position, momentum, phase-point,
and spin-direction | cannot be measured by an instrument that obeys the
orthogonal projection postulate. Continuous-in-time measurements provide the
missing theoretical framework to make sense of such observables. The elements
of the time-dependent instrument define a group called the \emph{instrumental
group} (IG). Relative to the IG, all of the time-dependence is contained in a
certain function called the \emph{Kraus-operator density} (KOD), which evolves
according to a classical Kolmogorov equation. Unlike the Lindblad master
equation, the KOD Kolmogorov equation is a direct expression of how the
elements of the instrument (not just the total channel) evolve. Shifting from
continuous measurement to sequential measurements more generally, the structure
of combining instruments in sequence is shown to correspond to the convolution
of their KODs. This convolution promotes the IG to an \emph{involutive Banach
algebra} (a structure that goes all the way back to the origins of POVM and
C*-algebra theory) which will be called the \emph{instrumental group algebra}
(IGA). The IGA is the true home of the KOD, similar to how the dual of a von
Neumann algebra is the home of the density operator. Operators on the IGA,
which play the same role for KODs as superoperators play for density operators,
are called \emph{ultraoperators} and various examples are discussed. Certain
ultraoperator-superoperator intertwining relations are considered, including
the relation between the KOD Kolmogorov equation and the Lindblad master
equation. The IGA is also shown to have actually two involutions: one respected
by the convolution ultraoperators and the other by the quantum channel
superoperators. Finally, the KOD Kolmogorov generators are derived for jump
processes and more general diffusive processes.

Abstract: Encoding combinatorial optimization problems into physically meaningful
Hamiltonians with tractable energy landscapes forms the foundation of quantum
optimization. Numerous works have studied such efficient encodings for the
class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. However,
many real-world tasks are constrained, and handling equality and, in
particular, inequality constraints on quantum computers remains a major
challenge. In this letter, we show that including inequality constraints is
equivalent to solving a multi-objective optimization. This insight motivates
the Multi-Objective Quantum Approximation (MOQA) framework, which approximates
the maximum via smaller $p$-norms and comes with rigorous performance
guarantees. MOQA operates directly at the Hamiltonian level and is compatible
with, but not restricted to, ground-state solvers such as quantum adiabatic
annealing, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), or
imaginary-time evolution. Moreover, it is not limited to quadratic functions.

Abstract: The prospect of quantum solutions for complicated optimization problems is
contingent on mapping the original problem onto a tractable quantum energy
landscape, e.g. an Ising-type Hamiltonian. Subsequently, techniques like
adiabatic optimization, quantum annealing, and the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) can be used to find the ground state of this
Hamiltonian. Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is one
prominent problem class for which this entire pipeline is well understood and
has received considerable attention over the past years. In this work, we
provide novel, tractable mappings for the maxima of multiple QUBO problems.
Termed Multi-Objective Quantum Approximations, or MOQA for short, our framework
allows us to recast new types of classical binary optimization problems as
ground state problems of a tractable Ising-type Hamiltonian. This, in turn,
opens the possibility of new quantum- and quantum-inspired solutions to a
variety of problems that frequently occur in practical applications. In
particular, MOQA can handle various types of routing and partitioning problems,
as well as inequality-constrained binary optimization problems.

Abstract: We study continuous-variable photonic quantum extreme learning machines as
fast, low-overhead front-ends for collider data processing. Data is encoded in
photonic modes through quadrature displacements and propagated through a
fixed-time Gaussian quantum substrate. The final readout occurs through
Gaussian-compatible measurements to produce a high-dimensional random feature
map. Only a linear classifier is trained, using a single linear solve, so
retraining is fast, and the optical path and detector response set the
analytical and inference latency. We evaluate this architecture on two
representative classification tasks, top-jet tagging and Higgs-boson
identification, with parameter-matched multi-layer perceptron (MLP) baselines.
Using standard public datasets and identical train, validation, and test
splits, the photonic Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) outperforms an MLP
with two hidden units for all considered training sizes, and matches or exceeds
an MLP with ten hidden units at large sample sizes, while training only the
linear readout. These results indicate that Gaussian photonic extreme-learning
machines can provide compact and expressive random features at fixed latency.
The combination of deterministic timing, rapid retraining, low optical power,
and room temperature operation makes photonic QELMs a credible building block
for online data selection and even first-stage trigger integration at future
collider experiments.

Abstract: We introduce a decoding framework for correlated errors in quantum LDPC codes

rewiring for interference (GARI) method, which modifies the correlated detector
error model by eliminating 4-cycles involving Y-type errors, while preserving
the equivalence of the decoding problem. We test our approach on the bivariate
bicycle codes of distances 6, 10, and 12. A normalized min-sum decoder with a
hybrid serial-layered schedule is applied on the transformed graph, achieving
high accuracy with low latency. Performance is further enhanced through
ensemble decoding, where 24 randomized normalized min-sum decoders run in
parallel on the transformed graph, yielding the highest reported accuracy (on
par with XYZ-Relay-BP) with unprecedented speed for the tested codes under
uniform depolarizing circuit level noise. For the distance 12 (gross) code, our
approach yields a logical error rate of $(6.70 \pm 1.93) \times 10^{-9}$ at a
practical physical error rate of $10^{-3}$. Furthermore, preliminary FPGA
implementation results show that such high accuracy can be achieved in real
time, with a per-round average decoding latency of 273 ns and sub-microsecond

Abstract: As the scope of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) grows to encompass ever
larger problem scales, so does the interest in whether quantum computing can
provide an advantage. In recent years, Quantum Lattice Gas Automata (QLGA) and
Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Methods (QLBM) have emerged as promising candidates
for quantum-native implementations of CFD solvers. Though the progress in
developing QLGA and QLBM algorithms has been significant, it has largely
focused on the development of models rather than applications. As a result, the
zoo of QLGA and QLBM algorithms has grown to target several equations and to
support many extensions, but the practical use of these models is largely
limited to quantum state tomography and observable measurement. This limitation
is crucial in practice, because unless very specific criteria are met, such
measurements may cancel out any potential quantum advantage. In this paper, we
propose an application based on discrete optimization and quantum search, which
circumvents flow field measurement altogether. We propose methods for
simulating many different lattice configurations simultaneously and describe
how the usage of amplitude estimation and quantum search can provide an
asymptotic quantum advantage. Throughout the paper, we provide detailed
complexity analyses of gate-level implementations of our circuits and consider
the benefits and costs of several encodings.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of quantum computing,
enabling reliable information processing in the presence of noise. Sparse
stabilizer codes -- referred to generally as quantum low-density parity-check
(QLDPC) codes -- have risen to the forefront of QEC research in recent years.
This can be attributed to several key factors. First, classical LDPC codes
admit low-complexity belief propagation iterative decoding and near-capacity
performance, which contributed to the early interest in QLDPC codes. Then, the
result promising constant overhead fault tolerance using QLDPC codes led to the
search for code families that go beyond the long-holding $\sqrt{n}$ scaling
barrier of minimum distance for codelength $n$. This resulted in recent
breakthroughs in the construction of QLDPC codes, which, combined with
efficient decoding algorithms and the development of fault-tolerant protocols
operating on QLDPC-encoded quantum information, provide a promising pathway to
low-overhead, fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, despite their
potential, challenges remain, particularly in constructing and decoding
finite-length codes that account for, or efficiently leverage, specific
characteristics of quantum hardware, such as connectivity, topology, native
gate sets, and noise models. This article provides an in-depth examination of
QLDPC codes and their iterative decoders, catering to an information theory
audience with no or limited background in quantum mechanics. We discuss the
theoretical underpinnings, explore unique characteristics of quantum channels,
and delineate key code constructions and decoding algorithms, ultimately
highlighting the impact and future prospects of QLDPC codes in quantum
information science.

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is central to science and engineering, but
faces severe scalability challenges, especially in high-dimensional,
multiscale, and turbulent regimes. Traditional numerical methods often become
prohibitively expensive under these conditions. Quantum computing and
quantum-inspired methods have been investigated as promising alternatives. This
review surveys advances at the intersection of quantum computing, quantum
algorithms, machine learning, and tensor network techniques for CFD. We discuss
the use of Variational Quantum Algorithms as hybrid quantum-classical solvers
for PDEs, emphasizing their ability to incorporate nonlinearities through
Quantum Nonlinear Processing Units. We further review Quantum Neural Networks
and Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks, which extend classical machine
learning frameworks to quantum hardware and have shown advantages in parameter
efficiency and solution accuracy for certain CFD benchmarks. Beyond quantum
computing, we examine tensor network methods, originally developed for quantum
many-body systems and now adapted to CFD as efficient high-dimensional
compression and solver tools. Reported studies include several orders of
magnitude reductions in memory and runtime while preserving accuracy. Together,
these approaches highlight quantum and quantum-inspired strategies that may
enable more efficient CFD solvers. This review closes with perspectives:
quantum CFD remains out of reach in the NISQ era, but quantum-inspired tensor
networks already show practical benefits, with hybrid approaches offering the

*Yi Shi,Eran Ginossar,Michael Stern,Marzena Szymanska*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new superconducting circuit design for quantum qubits that significantly improves their coherence times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is likely to be the development of more robust quantum qubits for practical quantum computing applications, given the current challenges in maintaining coherence times.

Method: The method involves proposing an interacting spin model with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, mapping this model to a superconducting circuit, and demonstrating that such a circuit can achieve coherence times exceeding several milliseconds under realistic environmental noise.

Result: The result is the demonstration that the proposed superconducting circuit design can achieve long coherence times, which is a significant advancement in the field of quantum computing qubits.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that this new design represents a promising direction for achieving more stable and reliable quantum qubits, which could be a significant step forward in the development of quantum computing technologies.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits are one of the leading candidates for storing and
manipulating quantum information. Among them, qubits embedded with intrinsic
noise protection have seen rapid advancements in recent years. This noise
protection is typically realized by isolating the computational states from
local sources of noise. Here, we propose an interacting spin model that
requires at least four spins with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor
couplings, where the two lowest eigenstates form a symmetry-protected qubit
manifold, which is robust to both relaxation and dephasing from local
perturbations. We map the spin model to a superconducting circuit and show that
such a circuit can reach coherence times exceeding several milliseconds in the
presence of realistic environmental noise. Our work opens a pathway to
realizing qubits with long coherence times in a new generation of quantum
devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子系统的稳定性，尤其是在动态扰动下的情况，具有重要的理论意义和应用价值。

Conclusion: 这项工作为分析量子系统在非平衡动态中的稳定性提供了新方法，并为量子算法设计提供了数学工具。

Abstract: Stability against perturbation is a highly nontrivial property of quantum
systems and is often a requirement to define new phases. In most systems where
stability can be rigorously established, only static perturbations are
considered; whether a system is stable against generic time-dependent
perturbations remains largely elusive. In this work, we identify a universal
phenomenon in $q$-local Hamiltonians called energy-space localization and prove
that it can survive under generic time-dependent perturbations, where the
evolving state is exponentially localized in an energy window of the
instantaneous spectrum. The property holds ubiquitously, and the leakage bounds
remain invariant under arbitrarily monotonic rescaling of evolution time. This
flexibility enables the energy-space localization to be a powerful tool in
proving the stability of systems. For spin glass models where the configuration
spaces are separated by large energy barriers, the localization in energy space
can induce a true localization in the configuration space and robustly break
ergodicity. We then demonstrate the applications of our results in several
systems with such barriers. For certain LDPC codes, we show that the evolving
state is localized near the original codeword for an exponentially long time
even under generic time-dependent perturbations. We also extend the stability
of LDPC codes against static $q$-local perturbations to quasi-$q$-local. In
addition, we show that for some classical hard optimization problems with
clustered solution space, the stability becomes an obstacle for quantum
Hamiltonian-based algorithms to drive the system out of local minima. Our work
provides a new lens for analyzing the non-equilibrium dynamics of generic
quantum systems, and versatile mathematical tools for stability proving and
quantum algorithm design.

*Sergei K. Suslov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper revisits the Bohr-Sommerfeld model for hydrogen-like ions of Uranium and Oganesson, and explores superheavy elements beyond Z=118. It uses the Sommerfeld fine structure formula and computer algebra methods to show the appearance of self-intersecting orbits in these atoms, particularly for Oganesson and superheavy elements up to Z=137. These orbits are classified by their `winding' numbers, which relate to the Coulomb field strength. The study bridges early quantum theory with modern superheavy element physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to examine the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model in the context of superheavy elements, providing a pedagogical perspective and connecting historical quantum theory with modern research.

Method: The authors use the Sommerfeld fine structure formula along with computer algebra methods to analyze and classify self-intersecting orbits in hydrogen-like ions of Uranium, Oganesson, and superheavy elements beyond Z=118 up to Z=137.

Result: The study identifies that self-intersecting orbits appear in the Coulomb fields of these superheavy elements. These orbits can be classified by their `winding' numbers, which correspond to specific values of Z, creating a bridge between early quantum theory and modern superheavy element physics.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that the Bohr-Sommerfeld model, combined with modern computational methods, can still provide valuable insights into the behavior of superheavy elements. The classification of orbits by `winding' numbers offers a simple yet effective way to understand the Coulomb field strength in these elements, furthering our understanding of the connections between historical and modern quantum theories.

Abstract: We revisit the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model to explore hydrogen-like ions of
Uranium ($Z=92$), Oganesson ($Z=118$), and hypothetical superheavy elements
beyond. Although superseded by the Dirac equation and modern quantum
electrodynamics, the semiclassical approach offers a historically and
pedagogically valuable perspective. Using the Sommerfeld fine structure formula
and computer algebra methods, we demonstrate the appearance of
self-intersecting orbits in super strong Coulomb fields, beginning with
Oganesson and hypothetical elements up to $Z\le137$. These orbits can be
classified by their `winding' numbers, providing a simple topological
description of Coulomb field strength in this framework. Our results highlight
a conceptual bridge between early quantum theory and modern superheavy element
physics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces new quantifiers for the practical utility of quantum processes and applies them to noise reduction in quantum control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for better tools to quantify the utility of quantum processes and applies them to practical scenarios like noise reduction.

Method: The authors propose quantifiers inspired by quantum states and study their behavior, applying them to noise reduction under open-loop control.

Result: The quantifiers demonstrate the maximum temporal mutual information a process can have and connect to recent concepts in quantum information theory.

Conclusion: The study enhances our understanding of quantum process quantification and validates existing interpretations on dynamical decoupling.

Abstract: The correlation structure of multitime quantum processes - succinctly
described by quantum combs - is an important resource for many quantum
information protocols and control tasks. Inspired by approaches for quantum
states, we introduce quantifiers of the practical utility of quantum processes
that satisfy monotonicity properties, thus overcoming shortcomings in previous
state-motivated approaches. Applying these quantifiers to the problem of noise
reduction of a quantum process under open-loop control, they are shown to
represent the largest amount of temporal mutual information that a process can
possibly exhibit. In addition, we study their resource composition behaviour
and connect them to the recently introduced notion of generalised comb
divergences. Finally, in light of these new quantifiers, we re-interpret the
numerical findings of npj Quantum Information 9, 104 (2023) on the relationship
of dynamical decoupling and non-Markovian memory, which were based on
insufficient resource quantifiers, and show that its main conclusion - the
interpretation of dynamical decoupling as a resource distillation - still
holds.

*Xiao-Fan Zhen,Zhen-Qiang Li,Jia-Cheng Fan,Su-Juan Qin,Fei Gao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses quantum cryptanalysis of cryptographic systems, specifically focusing on XOR-type functions and block ciphers based on permutation-based pseudorandom functions. Shi et al. previously demonstrated a method to reduce the resources needed for quantum attacks on such functions, and this paper builds on that work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the security of cryptographic systems against potential quantum computing threats is crucial for ensuring long-term security. This paper contributes to understanding how quantum attacks can be applied to specific types of cryptographic functions, which is important for developing defense mechanisms against such attacks.

Method: The paper introduces new cryptographic structures, namely PolyMAC and block ciphers based on TPP-PRFs, that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. It also presents an offline quantum attack method for these structures by constructing a decoupled XOR-type function.

Result: The authors successfully demonstrate that their new cryptographic structures are susceptible to quantum attacks, which reduces the complexity of such attacks compared to previous methods. They achieve this by optimizing the query complexity both in the quantum and classical models.

Conclusion: This paper advances the field of quantum cryptanalysis by identifying new targetable cryptographic structures and proposing efficient offline attack methods, thereby enhancing our understanding of quantum threats to classical cryptographic systems.

Abstract: Quantum cryptanalysis is essential for evaluating the security of
cryptographic systems against the threat of quantum computing. Recently, Shi et
al. introduced the dedicated quantum attack on XOR-type function that greatly
reduces the required resources (including circuit depth, width, and the number
of gates) compared to the parallel Grover-meets-Simon algorithm. Here, our
contribution is in two aspects. On the one hand, we discover new cryptographic
structures amenable to this attack: PolyMAC and block ciphers based on two
parallel permutation-based pseudorandom functions (TPP-PRFs), including XopEM,
SoEM22, SUMPIP, and DS-SoEM, partially answering Shi et al.'s open question. On
the other hand, for block ciphers based on TPP-PRFs, we break the obstacle that
this attack rely on online query by constructing decoupled XOR-type function,
then propose an offline quantum attack on them. Compared to previous results,
our offline attack exhibits significantly reduced query complexity.
Specifically, we reduce the number of queries to the encryption oracle from
$\tilde O(2^{(n+t)/2})$ to $\tilde O(2^{t})$ with the same time complexity in
the quantum query model, and enable its implementation in the classical query
model, optimizing both the classical query complexity and time complexity from
$\tilde O(2^{(2n)/3})$ to $\tilde O(2^{(2n-t)/3})$.

*Monit Sharma,Hoong Chuin Lau*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 这个研究通过使用置换对称性增强量子强化学习，在解决大规模组合优化问题如TSP上实现了零样本转移学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算和强化学习的快速发展，如何在大规模组合优化问题上实现有效的量子学习是一个重要的研究方向。现有的量子学习方法在处理大数据集时效率低下，难以推广。因此，开发具有置换对称性的量子模型以提高其泛化能力成为一个关键问题。

Method: 研究者利用置换对称增强的量子电路（EQCs）来建模TSP问题。这确保了模型能够捕捉到问题中的对称性结构。基于最近理论的结果，他们推导出适用于转移学习的泛化界限。具体而言，他们量化了n个城市和m个城市之间结构差异的一个新指标，并利用这一指标评估了模型在零样本转移学习中的表现。此外，他们还通过细部调整模型参数，进一步提升了模型在更大规模问题上的性能。

Result: 实验结果显示，基于EQC的量子强化学习方法在解决TSP问题时，能够在不依赖小规模训练数据的情况下实现良好的泛化能力。通过零样本转移，模型表现优异，并且在经过微调后进一步提升了性能。这与经典算法中规模无关的正向迁移现象一致。研究结果表明，将置换对称性嵌入到量子模型中可以显著提高其尺度适应性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过在量子强化学习中引入置换对称性增强架构，researchers成功实现了大规模组合优化问题上的零样本转移学习。这表明，置换不变性的有效利用是构建可扩展量子学习模型的关键因素。这些发现为未来开发更高效、更具泛化的量子算法提供了理论支持和实践指导。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of generalization in quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) for combinatorial optimization, focusing on the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Training quantum policies on large TSP
instances is often infeasible, so existing QRL approaches are limited to
small-scale problems. To mitigate this, we employed Equivariant Quantum
Circuits (EQCs) that respect the permutation symmetry of the TSP graph.
  This symmetry-aware ansatz enabled zero-shot transfer of trained parameters
from $n-$city training instances to larger m-city problems. Building on recent
theory showing that equivariant architectures avoid barren plateaus and
generalize well, we derived novel generalization bounds for the transfer
setting. Our analysis introduces a term quantifying the structural
dissimilarity between $n-$ and $m-$node TSPs, yielding an upper bound on
performance loss under transfer. Empirically, we trained EQC-based policies on
small $n-$city TSPs and evaluated them on larger instances, finding that they
retained strong performance zero-shot and further improved with fine-tuning,
consistent with classical observations of positive transfer between scales.
These results demonstrate that embedding permutation symmetry into quantum
models yields scalable QRL solutions for combinatorial tasks, highlighting the
crucial role of equivariance in transferable quantum learning.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Analysis of a research paper discussing a method for modeling light-matter interaction in strong quantum coupling using the Hopfield model, addressing challenges in accounting for mode coupling and dissipation. A method using Bogoliubov transformations and third quantization is presented to construct a quantum master equation in the polariton basis, enabling the engineering of strong interactions in nanostructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a significant gap in understanding how to accurately model light-matter interactions under strong quantum coupling conditions. It proposes a method to overcome the limitations of the standard Hopfield model.

Method: The authors use Bogoliubov transformation in the conservative case and third quantization technique in the dissipative case to construct a quantum model in the polariton eigenmode basis.

Result: The method allows boosting interaction strength and engineering nonlocal many-body interactions in nanostructures, resulting in strongly nonclassical light correlations.

Conclusion: This approach provides a framework for constructing quantum models that account for mode coupling and dissipation, enhancing the accuracy of theoretical descriptions and physical realizations in quantum optics and many-body physics.

Abstract: Light-matter interaction in the regime of strong quantum coupling is usually
treated within the framework of the Hopfield model. However, the picture of
coupling well-defined modes of light and matter is correct only as long as the
shapes of these eigenmodes are not substantially modified by the interaction.
Moreover, parameters of theoretical models are usually obtained by fitting to
experimental data. To date, there has been no straightforward method to
determine a quantum master equation corresponding to a system with specific
dielectric structure, which may lead to incompatibility of theoretical
descriptions and physical realizations. We present a recipe for obtaining a
quantum model in the polariton eigenmode basis based on Bogoliubov
transformation in the conservative case and third quantization technique in the
dissipative case. We show how this method can be used for boosting interaction
strength and engineering nonlocal many-body interactions in carefully designed
nanostructures, resulting in strongly nonclassical correlations of emitted
light.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the single-shot antidistinguishability of unitary operations under different probe settings, establishing equivalences and limitations in certain dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the antidistinguishability of quantum channels is essential for quantum information processing, particularly in quantum experiments without outcome identification.

Method: Mathematical proofs are used. The paper examines two scenarios: single-system probes and entangled probes. The analysis includes qubit and higher-dimensional cases.

Result: For three unitaries in qubits, maximally entangled probes are sufficient. However, in dimension 3, some sets of unitaries can be antidistinguished only with non-maximally entangled or single-system probes. Additionally, the union of two antidistinguishable sets remains antidistinguishable.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for understanding antidistinguishability in quantum channels, with specific results highlighting the role of probe states in different dimensions.

Abstract: The notion of antidistinguishability captures the possibility of ruling out
certain alternatives in a quantum experiment without identifying the actual
outcome. Although extensively studied for quantum states, the
antidistinguishability of quantum channels remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we investigate the single-shot antidistinguishability of unitary
operations. We analyse two scenarios: antidistinguishability with single-system
probes and with entangled probes. For sets of three unitaries, we first prove
that all maximally entangled states are equivalent in their performance as
probe. In the qubit case, we further establish that maximally entangled probes
are always sufficient: if a set of three qubit unitaries is antidistinguishable
with either a single-system or non-maximally entangled probe, then it is also
antidistinguishable with a maximally entangled one. However, in higher
dimension, this equivalence fails. In \textit{dimension 3}, there exists a set
of unitaries that are antidistinguishable with non-maximally entangled probe or
single-system probe but not with maximally entangled probe. We also establish
that union of two antidistinguishable sets of three qubit unitaries also forms
a set of antidistinguishable unitaries. Lastly, we provide methods to construct
antidistinguishable unitaries from non-antidistinguishable ones.

Abstract: Squeezed light enables quantum-enhanced phase estimation, with crucial
applications in both fundamental physics and emerging technologies. To fully
exploit the advantage provided by this approach, estimation protocols must
remain optimal across the entire parameter range and resilient to instabilities
in the probe state. In this context, strategies that rely on pre-calibrated
squeezing levels are vulnerable to degradation over time and become sub-optimal
when experimental conditions fluctuate. Here, we develop an adaptive
multiparameter estimation strategy for ab-initio phase estimation, achieving
sub-standard quantum limit precision in the full periodicity interval
$[0,\pi)$, without relying on prior knowledge of the squeezing parameter. Our
approach employs real-time feedback to jointly estimate both the optical phase
and the squeezing level, ensuring robustness against experimental drifts and
calibration errors. This self-calibrating scheme establishes a reliable
quantum-enhanced sensing framework, opening new routes for practical scenarios
and scalable distributed sensor networks using squeezed light.

Abstract: Drawing the quantum phase diagram of a many-body system in the parameter
space of its Hamiltonian can be seen as a learning problem, which implies
labelling the corresponding ground states according to some classification
criterium that defines the phases. In this work we adopt unsupervised learning,
where the algorithm has no access to any priorly labeled states, as a tool for
determining quantum phase diagrams of many-body systems. The algorithm directly
works with quantum states: given the ground-state configurations for different
values of the Hamiltonian parameters, the process uncovers the most significant
way of grouping them based on a similarity criterion that refers to the
fidelity between quantum states, that can be easily estimated, even
experimentally. We benchmark our method with two specific spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
chains, with states determined via tensor network techniques. We find that
unsupervised learning algorithms based on spectral clustering, combined with
``silhouette'' and ``elbow'' methods for determining the optimal number of
phases, can accurately reproduce the phase diagrams. Our results show how
unsupervised learning can autonomously recognize and possibly unveil novel
phases of quantum matter.

Abstract: Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for extracting
Hamiltonian eigenvalues, but its standard form targets individual eigenstates
and requires carefully prepared coherent inputs. To overcome these limitations,
we adopt an ensemble-based formulation of QPE that estimates the density of
states (DOS) of the Hamiltonian generator of the evolution. This approach,
which we refer to as DOS-QPE, builds on a prior formulation introduced by one
of the authors. In this work, we present DOS-QPE as a circuit primitive,
extending it with symmetry-adapted input ensembles and advanced spectrum
reconstruction techniques. This variant of QPE enables natural access to
thermodynamic properties, symmetry-resolved spectral functions, and features
relevant to quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate its performance on
fermionic models and nuclear Hamiltonians by casting the spectrum
reconstruction problem as a quadratic program solved via compressed sensing.
These use cases highlight the potential of DOS-QPE for early fault-tolerant
quantum simulations in spectroscopy, electronic structure, and nuclear theory.

Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm for structural mechanical

require extensive computational resources. Our approach provides an alternative
solution for a relevant 2D case by implementing a parametrized quantum circuit
that stores nodal displacements as quantum amplitudes and efficiently extracts
critical observables. The algorithm achieves optimal nodal displacements by
minimizing the elastic energy obtained from finite element method. The energy
is computed with only a polylogarithmic number of measurements. Extracting
relevant scalar observables such as the stress intensity factor is then done
efficiently on the converged solution. To validate the scalability of our
approach, we develop a warm start strategy based on a remeshing technique that
uses coarse solutions to circumvent barren plateaus in the optimization

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum resources such as entanglement and
squeezing to enhance parameter estimation precision beyond classical limits.
While optimal quantum control strategies can assist to reach or even surpass
the Heisenberg limit, their practical implementation often requires the
knowledge of the parameters to be estimated, necessitating adaptive control
methods with feedback. Such adaptive control methods have been considered in
single-parameter quantum metrology, but not much in multi-parameter quantum
metrology so far. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing an efficient
adaptive control strategy for multi-parameter quantum metrology in
two-dimensional systems. By eliminating the trade-offs among optimal
measurements, initial states, and control Hamiltonians through a system
extension scheme, we derive an explicit relation between the estimator variance
and evolution time. Through a reparameterization technique, the optimization of
evolution times in adaptive iterations are obtained, and a recursive relation
is established to characterize the precision improvement across the iterations.
The proposed strategy achieves the optimal performance up to an overall factor
of constant order with only a few iterations and demonstrates strong robustness
against deviations in the errors of control parameters at individual
iterations. Further analysis shows the effectiveness of this strategy for
Hamiltonians with arbitrary parameter dependence. This work provides a
practical approach for multi-parameter quantum metrology with adaptive
Hamiltonian control in realistic scenarios.

### [99] [Signatures of Topological Symmetries on a Noisy Quantum Simulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14817)
*Christopher Lamb,Robert M. Konik,Hubert Saleur,Ananda Roy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Topological symmetries are significant in quantum field theories, but realizing them in physical systems is challenging. Quantum simulators, such as IBM's Kingston, provide a new approach to study these symmetries. By employing a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on the quantum approximate optimization algorithm and quantum natural gradient optimization, the researchers successfully created eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators for the Ising conformal field theory using IBM's simulator. Their results closely aligned with classical computations, demonstrating that noisy quantum simulators can be effective platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and realizing topological symmetries in quantum field theories is crucial for advancing theoretical physics. However, conventional condensed matter systems often cannot directly probe these symmetries. By leveraging quantum simulators, researchers can overcome these limitations and gain new insights into quantum field theories.

Method: The researchers employed a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm on IBM's Kingston quantum simulator. This algorithm combines the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz with the quantum natural gradient optimization method to create eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators associated with topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory in two dimensions. The algorithm utilizes a variation of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with quantum natural gradient optimization method.

Result: The results obtained from the quantum device were found to be in reasonable agreement with classical computations, particularly in capturing signatures of topological symmetry through correlation functions of different qubit operators. This suggests that noisy quantum simulators can effectively be used as platforms for studying low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that are often challenging to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for using quantum simulators as platforms for investigating low-dimensional quantum field theories and accessing observables that are typically difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter systems.

Abstract: Topological symmetries, invertible and otherwise, play a fundamental role in
the investigation of quantum field theories. Despite their ubiquitous
importance across a multitude of disciplines ranging from string theory to
condensed matter physics, controlled realizations of models exhibiting these
symmetries in physical systems are rare. Quantum simulators based on engineered
solid-state devices provide a novel alternative to conventional condensed
matter systems for realizing these models.
  In this work, eigenstates of impurity Hamiltonians and loop operators
associated with the topological symmetries for the Ising conformal field theory
in two space-time dimensions are realized on IBM's Kingston simulator. The
relevant states are created on the quantum device using a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on a variation of the quantum
approximate optimization algorithm ansatz combined with the quantum natural
gradient optimization method. Signatures of the topological symmetry are
captured by measuring correlation functions of different qubit operators with
results obtained from the quantum device in reasonable agreement with those
obtained from classical computations. The current work demonstrates the
viability of noisy quantum simulators as platforms for investigating
low-dimensional quantum field theories with direct access to observables that
are often difficult to probe in conventional condensed matter experiments.

Abstract: Quantum code surgery is a promising technique to perform fault-tolerant
computation on quantum low-density parity-check codes. Recent developments have
significantly reduced the space overhead of surgery. However, generic surgery
operations still require $O(d)$ rounds of repeated syndrome extraction to be
made fault-tolerant. In this work, we focus on reducing the time overhead of
surgery. We first present a general set of conditions that ensure
fault-tolerant surgery operations can be performed with constant time overhead.
This fast surgery necessarily makes use of an auxiliary complex described by a
hypergraph rather than a graph. We then introduce a concrete scheme called
block reading, which performs transversal surgery across multiple code blocks.
We further investigate surgery operations with intermediate time overhead,
between $O(1)$ and $O(d)$, which apply to quantum locally testable codes.
Finally, we establish a circuit equivalence between homomorphic measurement and
hypergraph surgery and derive bounds on the time overhead of generic logical
measurement schemes. Overall, our results demonstrate that reducing the time
cost of code surgery is not reliant on the quantum memory being single-shot.
Instead it is chiefly the connectivity between a code and its measurement
ancilla system that determines the achievable measurement time overhead.

Abstract: Noise in near-term quantum devices limits the timescales over which
measurements can be reliably obtained. Existing data-driven extrapolation
methods extend the dynamics of quantum observables from measurements, but they
cannot guarantee that the recovered model reflects the true dynamics. In this
paper, we introduce atomic norm minimization as a framework to certify that a
model learned by any algorithm accurately captures the underlying dynamics of
quantum observables. This certification is valid when the system is governed by
a small number of well-separated Bohr frequencies. We validate the framework
across multiple algorithms on numerical experiments with spin-chain
Hamiltonians involving 8-20 qubits. Comparing with exact diagonalization,
certification yields an average forecasting error below 0.1 (within the
observable's range of $[-1, 1]$) in 98% of cases and below 0.05 in 89-97% of
cases, depending on the forecasting algorithm. Even in the presence of
realistic shot noise, certified models remain robust, with success rates
decreasing only to 88-95% for the 0.1 error threshold.

Abstract: Quantum teleportation enables high-security communications through end-to-end
quantum entangled pairs. End-to-end entangled pairs are created by using
swapping processes to consume short entangled pairs and generate long pairs.
However, due to environmental interference, entangled pairs decohere over time,
resulting in low fidelity. Thus, generating entangled pairs at the right time
is crucial. Moreover, the swapping process also causes additional fidelity
loss. To this end, this paper presents a short time slot protocol, where a time
slot can only accommodate a process. It has a more flexible arrangement of
entangling and swapping processes than the traditional long time slot protocol.
It raises a new optimization problem TETRIS for finding strategies of
entangling and swapping for each request to maximize the fidelity sum of all
accepted requests. To solve the TETRIS, we design two novel algorithms with
different optimization techniques. Finally, the simulation results manifest
that our algorithms can outperform the existing methods by up to 60 ~ 78% in
general, and by 20 ~ 75% even under low entangling probabilities.

Abstract: We investigate current fluctuations in open quantum systems beyond the
weak-coupling and Markovian regimes, focusing on a coherently driven qubit
strongly coupled to a structured bosonic environment. By combining full
counting statistics with the reaction coordinate mapping, we develop a
framework that enables the calculation of steady-state current fluctuations and
their temporal correlations in the strong-coupling regime. Our analysis reveals
that, unlike in weak coupling, both the average current and its fluctuations
exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on the system-environment interaction strength.
Notably, we identify a regime where current noise is suppressed below the
classical thermodynamic uncertainty bound, coinciding with enhanced
anticorrelations in quantum jump trajectories and faster system relaxation. We
further show that these features are linked to nonclassical properties of the
reaction coordinate mode, such as non-Gaussianity and quantum coherence. Our
results provide new insights and design principles for controlling current
fluctuations in quantum devices operating beyond the standard weak-coupling
paradigm.

Abstract: In multiparameter quantum metrology, the ultimate precision of joint
estimation is dictated by the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound. In this paper, we
discuss and analyze in detail an alternative approach: the stepwise estimation
strategy. In this approach, parameters are estimated sequentially, using an
optimized fraction of the total available resources allocated to each step. We
derive a tight and achievable precision bound for this protocol, the stepwise
separable bound, and provide its closed-form analytical expression, revealing a
crucial dependence on the chosen measurement ordering. We provide a rigorous
comparison with the joint measurement strategy, deriving analytical conditions
that determine when the stepwise approach offers superior precision. Through
the analysis of several paradigmatic SU(2) unitary encoding models, we
demonstrate that the stepwise strategy can indeed outperform joint
measurements, particularly in scenarios characterized by non-optimal probes or
models with a high degree of sloppiness. Our findings establish stepwise
estimation as a powerful alternative to joint and collective measurements,
proving that sequential protocols can provide a genuine metrological advantage,
especially in resource-constrained or imperfect experimental settings.

Abstract: Photoreduction of cryptochrome protein in the retina is a well-known
mechanism of navigation of birds through the geomagnetic field, yet the
biosignal nature of the mechanism remains unclear. The absorption of blue light
by the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) chromophore can alter the distribution
of electrons in cryptochrome and create radical pairs with separated charges.
In this study, the spin dynamics of electrons in the radical pair and its
coupling with spatial position were investigated by computational modeling from
a quantum mechanical perspective. Several interactions were considered in the
presence of an external magnetic field, and the resulting electric dipole
moment in cryptochrome was computed as the quantity emerging from this
coupling. The computations show the induced electric dipole moment clearly
depend on the characteristics of the applied magnetic field even after
considering dissipative effects. In fact, our findings indicate that the
radical pair in cryptochrome protein is a magnetic biosensor, in the sense that
in the presence of the geomagnetic field, variations in spin states can
influence its electric dipole moment, which may be interpreted via the bird as
an orientation signal. The results can be used in the advancement of
bio-inspired technologies which replicate animal magnetic sensitivity. On the
other hand, with increasing concern about the detrimental effects of
electromagnetic fields on wildlife and human health, studying the phenomenon of
magnetoreception can contribute to a deeper understanding of how biological
structures interact with these fields.

Conclusion: The model provides an alternative framework for DNA bubble dynamics with implications for structural biology and DNA therapeutics.

Abstract: We developed a low-energy model that can be used at any time to describe the
dynamics of DNA bubbles at temperatures below the melting point. The
Schr\"odinger equation associated with this problem is solved in imaginary time
with a quantum Coulomb potential, and we obtain an approximate expression for
its more general physical solution as a linear combination of the states whose
energies are close to the lower bound energy. We can then determine the
probability density, the first-passage time density, and the correlation
functions in terms of Bessel functions. Our findings are consistent with
results obtained directly from the Fokker-Planck equation. Comparisons with the
Gamma and Diffusion models are discussed.

Abstract: Microtubules stochastically switch between growth and shrinkage during
catastrophe events across a very large range of filament lengths, with the
length distribution at catastrophe peaking at a finite filament length, which
can aid the search for chromosomes during mitosis. To model these distinct
features, we introduce a topological model of a two-component microtubule cap,
where protected edge states give rise to different phases of microtubule
dynamics - growth, shrinkage, and a recently observed "stutter" phase. With
only two free parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the peaked
catastrophe length distribution and its dependence on tubulin concentration
from experimental data. The model further provides an analytical condition for
when the catastrophe length distribution is peaked. Our work shows how
microtubules may utilize topological edge states to promote length exploration,
elucidating a novel mechanism for search and target reaching in cellular
biology.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of cellular aggregates compressed between solids, showing they form capillary bridges that change shape and can rupture when mechanical forces reach a critical point.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanical properties of biological tissues is essential for advancing biophysics and regenerative medicine.

Method: The study used microscopy and computer simulations to observe the cellular aggregates under compression, tracking their dynamics over time.

Result: The cellular aggregates transitioned from rigid spheres to fluid-like bridges that can thicken and thin. The bridges' stability is influenced by cell growth and spreading. Rupture occurs when mechanical stress reaches a critical threshold, and simulations reveal the interplay between cell division/migration and mechanical forces in controlling the bridges.

Conclusion: The research introduces a new model for active soft matter, where biological tissues exhibit liquid-like behavior under confinement but with dynamic characteristics controlled by cellular activity.

Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit complex behaviors with their dynamics often
resembling inert soft matter such as liquids, polymers, colloids, and liquid
crystals. These analogies enable physics-based approaches for investigations of
emergent behaviors in biological processes. A well-studied case is the
spreading of cellular aggregates on solid surfaces, where they display dynamics
similar to viscous droplets. \textit{In vivo}, however, cells and tissues are
in a confined environment with varying geometries and mechanical properties to
which they need to adapt. In this work, we compressed cellular aggregates
between two solid surfaces and studied their dynamics using microscopy, and
computer simulations. The confined cellular aggregates transitioned from
compressed spheres into dynamic living capillary bridges exhibiting bridge
thinning and a convex-to-concave meniscus curvature transition. We found that
the stability of the bridge is determined by the interplay between cell growth
and cell spreading on the confining surfaces. This interaction leads to bridge
rupture at a critical length scale determined by the distance between the
plates. The force distributions, formation and stability regimes of the living
capillary bridges were characterized with full 3D computer simulations that
included cell division, migration and growth dynamics, directly showing how
mechanical principles govern the behavior of the living bridges; cellular
aggregates display jamming and stiffening analogously to granular matter, and
cell division along the long axis enhances thinning. Based on our results, we
propose a new class of active soft matter behavior, where cellular aggregates
exhibit liquid-like adaptation to confinement, but with self-organized
rupturing driven by biological activity.

Motivation: Improving understanding of how masking affects species in shared habitats and for disease control.

Method: Modeling of generic and mosquito auditory systems and testing of masking strategies with frequency modulation.

Result: Focused frequency masking is optimal for disrupting communication.

Conclusion: Findings help guide the selection of masking strategies for effective wildlife protection or disease control.

Abstract: The use of auditory masking has long been of interest in psychoacoustics and
for engineering purposes, in order to cover sounds that are disruptive to
humans or to species whose habitats overlap with ours. In most cases, we seek
to minimize the disturbances to the communication of wildlife. However, in the
case of pathogen-carrying insects, we may want to maximize these disturbances
as a way to control populations. In the current work, we explore candidate
masking strategies for a generic model of active auditory systems and a model
of the mosquito auditory system. For both models, we find that masks with all
acoustic power focused into just one or a few frequencies perform best. We
propose that masks based on rapid frequency modulation are most effective for
maximal disruption of information transfer and minimizing intelligibility. We
hope that these results will serve to guide the avoidance or selection of
possible acoustic signals for, respectively, maximizing or minimizing
communication.

Motivation: The study aims to investigate HND as an alternative for CsI in photon detectors, focusing on its durability, quantum efficiency, and response to ion bombardment.

Method: HND materials were prepared through hydrogenation, stored for over two years, and coated onto PCBs or THGEMs using a pulsed spray technique. Quantum efficiency and reflectivity were measured under various conditions.

Result: HND showed quantum efficiency ~4% at 122 nm, within a factor of 10 of literature values for hydrogenated samples. Reflective HND coatings demonstrated higher robustness against ion bombardment compared to CsI. THGEM characterization showed minimal response alteration after HND coatings.

Conclusion: HND-based photocathodes exhibit significant potential as a durable and effective option for gaseous detectors, particularly in single-photon detection applications due to their improved performance compared to CsI.

Abstract: This study investigates the suitability of Hydrogenated NanoDiamond (HND)
materials as an alternative for CsI in MPGD-based photon detectors. The
research focuses on characterizing HND photocathodes coupled with THGEM +
Micromegas-based detectors. The HND grains were prepared via hydrogenation and
stored in water for more than two years. They were then coated on PCB discs or
THGEMs using a pulsed spray technique. The resulting quantum efficiency (QE)
values (~4% at 122 nm) were found to be within a factor of 10 of the best
freshly hydrogenated samples reported in the literature ( ~40% at 120 nm). The
robustness of reflective HND photocathodes against ion bombardment was measured
to be about 10 times larger than the corresponding CsI one after the same
charge accumulation. Furthermore, THGEM characterization indicates minimal
alteration in response after HND coatings. These results suggest that HND holds
potential as a more robust photocathode for gaseous detectors, offering
improved performance in single-photon detection applications.

Abstract: A systematic study is conducted to understand the coincident resolving time
(CRT) for a pair of Lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) and the plastic
scintillation detector bars under the Geant4 framework. Crystals are coupled to
a silicon photomultiplier single pad wafer with an appropriate optical coupling
for signal readout. Pad reads the light photons undergoing optoelectronic
conversion at the wafer site and generates electrical pulses with a
bi-exponential shape. These signals are used to determine the trigger time
stamp of back-to-back gamma-rays emitted from a point source, enabling the
evaluation of CRT performance at different plastic scintillator lengths. For
the LYSO detector, the simulation yields the CRT response of 174 ps, which
aligns to the literature reported value for the dimensions 2 mm x 2 mm x 10 mm.
To identify the plastic scintillator dimensions with an integrated gamma-ray
detection efficiency comparable to LYSO's photopeak efficiency at 511 keV gamma
photons, various bar lengths of commercial plastic BC404 and TIFR Ooty's
in-house developed plastic material are attempted in Geant4. Consequently, for
both the plastic scintillators, the equivalent length (for the same
cross-sectional area) was found to be 4 times that of LYSO crystal length at a
threshold of 25 keV. CRT value determined for this dimension is found to be
$\approx$ 300 ps for both the plastic medium. It suggests that, if an animal
preclinical PET scanner is developed with plastic bars, the minimum achievable
image resolution (FWHM) of $\approx$ 4.5 cm can be expected for a pair of
detection elements.

Abstract: We present the design and simulation of a 30 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick 4H-SiC
Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) optimized for high-voltage operation. A 2.4
$\mathrm{\mu m}$ thick epitaxially grown gain layer enables controlled internal

*Paolo Martini,Kostas Kanellopulos,Silvan Schmid*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A comprehensive design guide for thermomechanical IR detectors based on silicon nitride is developed, exploring the influence of geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties on key performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of IR detectors lacks a unified design framework, prompting this study to address the gap by providing a comprehensive guide.

Method: Systematic analysis using a validated analytical model to explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical properties affect thermal time constant, noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity.

Result: The analysis reveals how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and response speed, and provides a broad design space for performance prediction and optimization.

Conclusion: This work serves as a foundational resource for designing next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the fundamental detection limit.

Abstract: Thermomechanical infrared (IR) detectors have emerged as promising
alternatives to traditional photon and thermoelectric sensors, offering
broadband sensitivity and low noise without the need for cryogenic cooling.
Despite recent advances, the field still lacks a unified framework to guide the
design of these nanomechanical systems. This work addresses that gap by
providing a comprehensive design guide for IR thermal detectors based on
silicon nitride drumhead and trampolines. Leveraging a validated analytical
model, we systematically explore how geometry, tensile stress, and optical
properties influence key performance metrics such as thermal time constant,
noise-equivalent power, and specific detectivity. The analysis encompasses both
bare silicon nitride and structures with broadband absorber layers, revealing
how different parameter regimes affect the trade-off between sensitivity and
response speed. Rather than focusing on a single device architecture, this
study maps out a broad design space, enabling performance prediction and
optimisation for a variety of application requirements. As such, it serves not
only as a reference for benchmarking existing devices but also as a practical
tool for engineering next-generation IR sensors that can operate close to the
fundamental detection limit. This work is intended as a foundational resource
for researchers and designers aiming to tailor IR detectors to specific use
cases.

### [115] [Radial kinks in the boson stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13923)
*Tian-Chi Ma,Xiang-Yu Wang,Hai-Qing Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Radial kinks in boson stars with varying compactness exhibit different behaviors, with higher compactness slowing their movement towards the star's origin, potentially helping probe the star's internal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the dynamics of radial kinks in boson stars and solitonic stars to explore their potential applications in probing astrophysical objects, even black holes.

Method: Numerical simulations were performed for various compactness values of both boson and solitonic stars, focusing on the kink's trajectory, velocity, and collision effects with the star's origin.

Result: Higher compactness boson stars slow kinks down, and in highly compact stars, a new kink may form after collision with the origin.

Conclusion: Radial kinks in boson stars with varying compactness show promise as a tool to probe dense astrophysical objects, including the inner structure of black holes.

Abstract: In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background
of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the
massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study
the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that
the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of
the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to
collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is
highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the
origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose
that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal
structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black
holes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The geometric foundations of General Relativity are revisited, with
particular attention to its gauge invariance, as a key to understanding the
true nature of spacetime. Beyond the common image of spacetime as a deformable
'fabric' filling the Universe, curvature is interpreted as the dynamic
interplay between matter and interacting fields; a view already emphasized by
Einstein and Weyl, but sometimes overlooked in the literature. Building on
these tools, a Newtonian framework is reconstructed that captures essential
aspects of cosmology, showing how classical intuition can coexist with modern
geometric insights. This perspective shifts the focus from substance to
relationships, offering a fresh magnifying glass through which to reinterpret
gravitational dynamics and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The
similarities of this approach with other recent, more ambitious ones carried
out at the quantum level are quite remarkable.

Conclusion: 研究为 wormhole 提供了完整的路径积分方法和热力学框架。

Abstract: We consider the path-integral quantization of a minisuperspace cut-and-paste
Lorentzian wormhole connecting two Minkowski spacetimes. The dynamics of the
throat radius as a function of proper time is governed by a non-local effective
action derived by an application of the Israel junction condition formalism.
Within a saddle-point approximation of the propagator describing the evolution
from an initial to a final throat radius, we show that topology-changing
transitions are suppressed by the Jacobi determinant. In addition, we analyze
the gravitational thermodynamics of the wormhole spacetime by a Wick rotation
of the Israel-Lanczos equations in the presence of a thin-shell source. The
resulting Euclideanized field equations are assumed to originate from a
Euclidean effective gravity-matter action, which enters the path-integral
representation of the gravitational canonical partition function. Therefrom we
associate a temperature given by the inverse period of solutions, as well as a
gravitational entropy as functions of the surface energy density and equation
of state parameter of the shell. Both quantities are sourced entirely by the
discontinuity of the extrinsic curvature across the junction. We show how this
result can be applied to deduce a thermodynamic first law as the differential
version of the conservation equation relating the effective mass of the shell
to its surface pressure.

### [120] [Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957)
*Jan Heisig*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational waves at kHz can probe the early universe beyond CMB reach. Current detectors fall short. A new interferometer design using closed optical loops and Einstein Telescope parameters shows sensitivity approaching BBN bounds at kHz. This could open a new path for exploring high-frequency GW backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting gravitational waves with very high frequencies, which can provide insights into the early universe's physics beyond what the cosmic microwave background can offer.

Method: The authors propose using a new interferometric architecture with closed optical loops. The gravitational wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals, creating sharp, narrowband resonances with a predictable comb structure that serves as an experimental signature. The design is compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure.

Result: For loops with parameters compatible with Einstein Telescope infrastructure and finesse of 500, the sensitivity is projected to approach and surpass the BBN bound in the kHz range after one year of integration.

Conclusion: This work presents a feasible and distinctive method for exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, bridging a significant gap in detects.

Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe
of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic
microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV.
Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We
propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in
which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over
many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable
comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or
triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope
infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that
approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one
year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and
distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave
backgrounds.

Abstract: With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the
need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for
asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force
community have focused on modeling these binaries' inspiral regime, but for
ground-based detectors the systems' final merger can represent the dominant
part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale
self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown
regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the
next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include
the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of
composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of
variables on the binary's mechanical phase space during the transition to
plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and
comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.

Abstract: We present the second release of the $\texttt{GR-Athena++}$ waveform catalog,

simulations. These simulations are performed at high resolutions and represent
a step toward generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms that can
eventually meet the accuracy requirements of upcoming next-generation

Gravitational waves are extracted at future null infinity ( $\mathscr{I}^{+}$)
using both Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction. For
each simulation, we provide strain data across multiple resolutions and analyze
waveform accuracy via convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses. The
absolute phase and relative amplitude differences reach their largest values
near the merger, while the smallest errors are of order $\mathscr{O}(10^{-2})$
and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. A self-mismatch analysis of the
dominant $(2,2)$ mode yields mismatches between $\mathscr{O}(10^{-5})$ and
$\mathscr{O}(10^{-7})$ for a total binary mass of $10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the
frequency range $[0.002, 0.1]$ Hz using LISA noise curve. All waveforms are

Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic

Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1
neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh
and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny
platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the
computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX
infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs,
running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We
validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results
obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with
simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state.
Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in
the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling
performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful
tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger
astrophysics.

with perturbed and unperturbed nonlinear dynamical evolutions in spherical
symmetry, obtained using a dimensional reduction that allows us to evolve
spacetimes with any number of background dimensions using the same numerical
framework, while preserving the full gauge freedom of standard approaches to
numerical relativity. The results of these evolutions indicate that the
solutions we identify as perturbatively stable are indeed generally stable to
nonlinear spherical dynamics.

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Bianchi I universe in modified loop quantum
cosmology (Model I, or mLQC-I), uncovering a robust mechanism for
isotropization. As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are
resolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature:
following the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to
zero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the
collapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization.
Consequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic
scales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the
quantum epoch without fine-tuning. Our findings demonstrate that mLQC-I not
only resolves singularities but also provides a more effective pathway for
suppressing anisotropies than other models, thereby reinforcing its viability
as a description of the early universe.

Motivation: 加速膨胀是一个关键的宇宙现象，在宇宙学中通常通过引入暗能量或 cosmological常数来解释。然而，该论文通过研究广义相对论和流体力学方程，揭示了爱因斯坦-欧拉方程内在的不稳定性机制，为解释加速膨胀提供了新的视角。

Method: 论文采用了自相似变量和幂级数展开的方法，研究了弗里德曼时空在径向扰动下的稳定性。首先，通过对爱因斯坦-欧拉方程的自相似变量变换，将问题简化为常微分方程组的稳定性分析。然后，通过幂级数展开，确定了鞍点$SM$的性质，并分析了解的渐进行为。

Result: 研究显示，$k

Conclusion: 该论文通过分析压力为零的弗里德曼时空的径向扰动稳定性，揭示了爱因斯坦-欧拉方程中的内在不稳定性机制。结果表明，无需引入暗能量或 cosmological常数，爱因斯坦-欧拉方程本身就蕴含了加速膨胀的机制。这一发现为理解宇宙加速膨胀现象提供了重要的理论支持。

Abstract: We characterize the local instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes to
radial perturbation at the Big Bang. The analysis is based on a formulation of
the Einstein-Euler equations in self-similar variables $(t,\xi)$, with
$\xi=r/t$, conceived to realize the critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime as a
stationary solution whose character as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$ is
determined via an expansion of smooth solutions in even powers of $\xi$. The
eigenvalues of $SM$ imply the $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes are unstable
solutions within the unstable manifold of $SM$. We prove that all solutions
smooth at the center of symmetry agree with a Friedmann spacetime at leading
order in $\xi$, and with an eye toward Cosmology, we focus on $\mathcal{F}$,
the set of solutions which agree with a $k<0$ Friedmann spacetime at leading
order, providing the maximal family into which generic underdense radial
perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve. We
prove solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ generically accelerate away from Friedmann
spacetimes at intermediate times but decay back to the same leading order
Friedmann spacetime asymptotically as $t\to\infty$. Thus instabilities inherent
in the Einstein-Euler equations provide a natural mechanism for an accelerated
expansion without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.

Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers are disrupted by various types of
nonstationary noise, referred to as glitch noise, that affect data analysis and
interferometer sensitivity. The accurate identification and classification of
glitch noise are essential for improving the reliability of gravitational wave
observations. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised
machine learning for classifying images with nonstationary noise in the KAGRA
O3GK data. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with spectral
clustering, we identified eight distinct glitch noise categories. The latent
variables obtained from VAE were dimensionally compressed, visualized in
three-dimensional space, and classified using spectral clustering to better
understand the glitch noise characteristics of KAGRA during the O3GK period.
Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised learning for efficient
glitch noise classification, which may in turn potentially facilitate
interferometer upgrades and the development of future third-generation

Motivation: 这是一个关于宇宙学中的关键问题的探索：如何统一暗能量和宇宙加速膨胀的理论。这样的统一有助于我们更全面地理解宇宙的能量构成及其演化机制。

Method: 我们用修正过的爱因斯坦-霍尔顿作用，引入了标量耦合函数，后者仅依赖物质的能量密度，并探讨了该函数的形式，使其能够同时描述暗能量成分的动态演化和宇宙学早期的inflaton角色。数学分析和结构推导是方法的核心。

Result: 我们发现，一个可以满足暗能量作为动态成分并参与宇宙加速膨胀的标量耦合函数，其方程式使得w接近但不等于-1，这与最新的DESI数据相吻合。

Conclusion: 通过引入标量耦合模型，我们为理解暗能量与宇宙学的结合提供了新的理论框架，并与观测数据保持一致。

Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the
Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter
sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on
the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function
encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine
the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be
dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we
show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy
equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the
latest DESI data.

TL;DR: This paper reviews the current status of quantum-corrected black hole solutions within the Asymptotic Safety approach, discussing their structure, properties, thermodynamics, evaporation, dynamical aspects, and overall implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is likely motivated by the desire to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, specifically through the Asymptotic Safety framework, which offers a promising approach to quantum gravity.

Method: The paper reviews existing research and analysis within the Asymptotic Safety approach, synthesizing findings from various studies on quantum-corrected black hole solutions.

Result: The review highlights significant progress in constructing and analyzing quantum-corrected black hole solutions, including their thermodynamic properties, evaporation processes, and dynamical behavior such as quasinormal modes and shadows.,

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the Asymptotic Safety approach provides valuable insights into quantum corrections to black holes, offering a robust framework for further theoretical exploration and phenomenological investigation. However, challenges remain in fully understanding the implications for quantum gravity and astrophysics.

Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum
gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that
ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom.
Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of
this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight
the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of
quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the
Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of
classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of
couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We
discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their
thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal
modes and shadows.

Abstract: A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract
model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes
from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity.
In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the
equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime
patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric
Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine
the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the
associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our
analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients
suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we
emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be
exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.

### [131] [Quantum confinement of scalar bosons in the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime: uniform magnetic field and rainbow gravity effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14789)
*Omar Mustafa,Abdullah Guvendi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper studies the effects of rainbow gravity and a cosmological constant on Klein-Gordon scalar bosons and antibosons in a Bonnor-Melvin spacetime with a uniform magnetic field. The analysis reveals closed-form solutions for energy spectra and radial wavefunctions, with magnetic quantum states collapsing into m=0 levels for each radial excitation. Strong magnetic fields enhance spatial localization of the bosons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors investigate how gravitational corrections and external fields influence relativistic quantum fields in curved and magnetized spacetimes. Their work contributes to understanding quantum field dynamics under extreme conditions.

Method: The study employs analytical methods to solve the Klein-Gordon equation in the Bonnor-Melvin spacetime, incorporating rainbow gravity corrections. It considers two specific models of rainbow gravity and uses hypergeometric differential equations to derive solutions for energy spectra and wavefunctions.

Result: The paper finds that in the presence of a cosmological constant, the magnetic quantum states collapse into the m=0 level for each radial excitation. Strong magnetic fields enhance the spatial localization of the bosons, forming static or rotating ring-like configurations. The results highlight the interplay of gravitational confinement, topology, and magnetic fields in shaping quantum states.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that rainbow gravity corrections and a cosmological constant significantly influence the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic quantum fields in Bonnor-Melvin spacetimes with magnetic fields. The closed-form solutions provide a framework for further studying quantum systems in curved backgrounds with external influences.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and
antibosons confined in the Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime under a uniform
magnetic field, incorporating rainbow gravity (RG) corrections with a positive
cosmological constant. The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an
infinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers.
Within the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric
differential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy
spectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.
Two representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and
loop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric
particle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized
geometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \neq 0$ onto the $m
= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.
Increasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,
establishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local
quantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that
stronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into
static or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that
evolve systematically with quantum numbers. These findings reveal how
gravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale
corrections jointly govern the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic
quantum fields in curved and magnetized backgrounds.

Abstract: In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable
wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the
framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Two functional forms of the theory are
considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R,
L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are
obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density
profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution
influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to
verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic
matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total
gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical
viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and
its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational
signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within
$f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter
environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole
geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new
insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and
astrophysical observations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that
arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In
particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts
simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a
nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase
with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous
polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe
quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further
control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of
both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark
flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a
SU(3) system.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Landau理论在相变研究中基础，扩展约束条件下的理论探索前沿。

Method: Landau型理论，引入约束条件，进行重整化群分析。

Result: 有序参数异常维度显著高于O(3)类，η≈0.239。

Conclusion: 通常条件下不常见，说明新相变行为。

Abstract: We study the critical behavior of a Landau-type theory for ferroelectrics in
which the polarization order parameter $\vec{P}$ is subject to a
divergence-free constraint, such that only loop-like polarization
configurations contribute to the partition function. This constraint forces the
number of components of the field $\vec{P}$ to equal the spatial dimensionality
$D$, allowing a natural extension of the present theory to $O(N)$ models with
$N=D$. Renormalization group analysis reveals critical behavior beyond the
conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In particular, the order
parameter acquires a remarkably large anomalous dimension, with $\eta\approx
0.239$ in three dimensions -- significantly exceeding the value $\eta\approx
0.034$ typical of the $O(3)$ universality class. This is due to an emergent
gauge symmetry originating with the local constraint.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Phonon-limited transport in TaAs family of Weyl semimetals is studied, and it's shown that NbP has the highest conductivity, a result from its large Fermi velocities and strong scattering rates. TaAs has the lowest conductivity due to reduced carrier pockets and velocities. Doping affects TaAs more than NbP. Other materials in the family show intermediate behavior.

Motivation: Understanding the transport properties of Weyl semimetals is essential for both fundamental physics and potential applications in electronics.

Method: Systematic first-principles study using the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation.

Result: Calculations show excellent agreement with experimental data. NbP has the highest conductivity, while TaAs has the lowest. Doping affects the conductivity asymmetrically in TaAs.

Conclusion: Phonon scattering is critical in limiting transport in these systems. doping plays a significant role in determining the carrier dynamics and electronic response.

Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in
the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals using the ab initio Boltzmann transport
equation. The calculated electrical conductivities show excellent agreement
with experimental data for high-quality samples, confirming that transport in
these systems is predominantly limited by phonon scattering. Among the four
compounds, NbP achieves the highest conductivity, governed primarily by its
large Fermi velocities that offset its stronger scattering rates. In contrast,
TaAs displays the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and
limited carrier velocities. Additionally, NbP conductivity remains largely
unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced
electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP show intermediate behavior, reflecting
their Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space. These findings
provide microscopic insight into the transport mechanisms of the TaAs family
and emphasize the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in
shaping their electronic response.

### [136] [Towards a unified mechanistic understanding of the electrical response of bipolar nanofluidic systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14080)
*Ayelet Ben-Kish Sharvit,Yoav Green*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: With the increasing demand for sustainable water and energy solutions, engineers are continuously seeking innovative strategies to improve the performance of nanoporous and nanochannel devices. This paper introduces a unified theoretical and numerical framework that elucidates the interplay between voltage and a dimensionless parameter η, which is influenced by geometry and surface charge densities in both positive and negative charge regions. By incorporating both low- and high-voltage limiting cases, the framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the system responses under varying configurations, aiding in the design optimization of nanofluidic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for clean water and green energy has led to a continuous need for advancements in desalination and energy-harvesting systems. These systems often rely on complex nanofluidic devices, whose performance is influenced by voltage applications and geometric configurations. However, the underlying physics of these systems is not fully understood, making optimization challenging. This paper seeks to address these challenges by providing a unified framework for enhancing the design of such devices.

Method: The paper employs a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to develop a comprehensive framework for the design optimization of nanofluidic devices. By introducing a dimensionless parameter η, which accounts for the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities in both charged regions, the authors analyze the system's response under different voltage conditions and configurations. They also compare their numerical results with various theoretical models to validate their framework and explain any discrepancies.

Result: The study reveals that the system response is significantly influenced by the interplay between voltage and the parameter η. The framework successfully predicts the current-voltage behavior across a range of configurations, demonstrating its robustness and versatility. Furthermore, the comparison with theoretical models highlights both accurate predictions and areas where empirical optimization is still needed. The findings provide a systematic approach for engineers and scientists to optimize nanofluidic devices more efficiently.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking unified framework that bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in the field of nanofluidic devices. By accounting for the critical parameter η and incorporating both low- and high-voltage scenarios, the framework offers a powerful tool for systematic design optimization. The results not only enhance our understanding of the underlying physics but also serve as a roadmap for future experimental and numerical studies, ultimately accelerating the development of more efficient and sustainable nanotechnology applications.

Abstract: Bipolar nanoporous membranes and bipolar nanochannels are used in water
desalination and energy-harvesting systems that provide clean water and green
energy, respectively. The growing need for both requires continuous improvement
of their performance. However, the underlying physics of these complex systems
is still not fully understood, making empirical optimization slow and
inefficient. In this work, we combine theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations to develop a unified framework for improving the design of
nanofluidic devices. We show that the system response is governed by the
interplay between the applied voltage and a parameter $\eta$, which depends on
the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities of both charged regions. At
low voltages, the response is mostly determined by $\eta$, allowing its
dependence to be represented by a simplified phase space. At high voltages,
this phase space becomes oversimplified. To demonstrate the framework's
robustness, we scan a range of configurations, from unipolar channels (single
charged region) to bipolar channels (positive and negative segments). We
compare the numerically simulated current-voltage responses with three
theoretical models, which are limiting scenarios within the phase space, and
explain the observed deviations. These findings can help reduce the time and
resources required to optimize nanofluidic devices and improve the
interpretation of experiments and simulations.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP)
effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model
that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections,
avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate
parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization
scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to
the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified
framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry
curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate
representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method
incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic
intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy)
independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter
(e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with
theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to
geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying
quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase
effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric
phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials.
It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and
potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological
phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a
new spectroscopy design.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper presents a non-contact SEM technique, Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), for mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures. It achieves high precision and sensitivity by fitting Kikuchi patterns and operates in both transmission and reflection modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a non-contact technique for nanoscale thermodynamic measurements, addressing the challenge of physical contact disrupting the system.

Method: KDTh uses scanning electron microscopy to raster a focused electron probe across samples, detecting lattice changes via Kikuchi patterns. It calculates temperature changes using the coefficient of thermal expansion. The method offers high precision and sensitivity by analyzing the entire Kikuchi pattern.

Result: The technique achieves a parameter precision of ~0.01% and temperature sensitivity of 2.2 K/√Hz. It operates in both transmission (TKD) and reflection (EBSD) modes.

Conclusion: KDTh is a significant advancement in nanoscale thermodynamic measurement, offering advanced sensitivity and versatility across different modes without physical contact.

Abstract: Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new
metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and
pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement
is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we
demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning
electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures
and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline
samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced
using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and
temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe
across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature
sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting
the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission
electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission
Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction,
EBSD) modes.

Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit
interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal
superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a
model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave
superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a
two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by
utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented
perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we
achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through
stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.

Abstract: A twisted honeycomb bilayer exhibits a moir\'e superstructure that is
composed of a hexagonal arrangement of AB and BA stacked domains separated by
domain boundaries. In the case of twisted bilayer graphene, the application of
an electric field normal to the bilayer leads to the opening of inverted band
gaps in the AB and BA stacked domains. The inverted band gaps result in the
formation of a two-dimensional triangular network of counterpropagating valley
protected helical domain boundary states, also referred to as the quantum
valley Hall effect. Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum
valley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex
than in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric
fields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of
freedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a
stronger topological protection. For electric fields smaller than the
aforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley
Hall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is
lifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.

Abstract: Floquet engineering with high-frequency light offers dynamic control over
topological phases in quantum materials. While in 3D Dirac systems circularly
polarized light is known to induce topological phase transitions via gap
opening, linearly polarized light (LPL) has generally been considered
ineffective. Here we show that in quasi-2D Dirac materials the second-order
momentum term arising from the intersurface coupling can induce a topological
phase transition under LPL, leading to chiral edge channels. Considering an
ultrathin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film as a representative system, we show that this
transition occurs at experimentally accessible light intensities. Our results
thus promote quasi-2D materials as viable platforms for light-controlled
topological phases, expanding the potential of Floquet topological engineering.

Abstract: This work provides a detailed mapping of various mechanisms of
surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN HEMTs across a temperature range from
room to cryogenic levels. Two-dimensional variable-range hopping is observed at
small gate bias. Under higher reverse gate bias, the leakage is dominated by
the Poole--Frenkel emission above 220 K, but gradually transitions to the
trap-assisted tunneling below 220 K owing to the frozen-trap effect. The trap
barrier height extracted from the gate leakage current under the upward gate
sweep is 0.65 V, which is 12\% higher than that from the downward sweep. The
gate leakage current as a function of the gate bias exhibits clockwise
hysteresis loops above 220 K but counterclockwise ones below 220 K. This
remarkable opposite hysteresis phenomenon is thoroughly explained by the trap
mechanisms.

Abstract: In disordered lattices, itinerant electrons typically undergo Anderson
localization due to random phase interference, which suppresses their motion.
By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized
owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive.
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a
representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform
an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay
between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological
approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance,
whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven
delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical
mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{\'e} tunneling strength via
spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing
magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder
responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results
highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{\'e} materials
and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous
Hall effect in disordered moir{\'e} systems.

Abstract: Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal
fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal
triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold
electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits
a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can
occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly
demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using
full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the
performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing
performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty
relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on
two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the
nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes
significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the
nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that
are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude.
We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles
by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and
information flow.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects
whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion
strings can terminate on a N\'eel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic
analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated N\'eel DW tends to
rotate into a Bloch DW, the N\'eel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends
on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather
than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the
DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction
between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square
lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results
establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a
D-brane.

Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the energy level spectrum and thus the
optical response in semiconductors. In this respect, lead-halide perovskite
nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical
phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton
states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a
new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long
coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in
a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we
observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level
model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the
Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons
with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence
of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the
optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical
dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.

Abstract: We investigate quantum and quantum-relativistic effects associated with the
noise power spectrum and the fluctuation--dissipation relation between
current--noise spectra and linear--response conductance at low frequencies of
the electromagnetic field. At high frequencies, vacuum catastrophe is shown to
be avoided by the presence of Casimir force. At low frequencies, the quantum
effect associated with one--dimensional structures under the conditions of
ballistic transport typical at the nanometric scale length are briefly reviewed
in terms of a universal quasi-particle approach. The case of a photon gas
inside an appropriate black-body cavity is found to provide a physical
interpretation of the lines spectra of atomic elements within an exact
statistical approach based on a physical interpretation of the fine structure

Abstract: We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g.,
Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a
$\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling,
charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase
condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one
spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The
resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few
nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences
typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its
characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the
smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a
mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto
Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR,
including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper investigates electron transport in magnetic anisotropic (MA) junctions under strong and weak magnetic anisotropy, analyzing charge and spin conductivities as functions of the angle between Néel vectors. Strong MA regime leads to vanishing charge conductivity as the angle approaches $	heta = 	ext{arcsin(1)}$, while in weak MA, it remains finite. Normal metal insertion induces Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations in charge conductance. Transport in strong MA is dominated by up-spin electrons, while both spin channels contribute in weak MA. These findings suggest potential applications in spintronic devices and quantum interference-based spintronics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to explore the electron transport properties in MA junctions, which is crucial for the development of spintronic devices. The researchers are likely interested in understanding how the anisotropy affects the charge and spin conductivities and how these properties can be utilized for practical applications.

Method: Theoretical investigation was conducted. The researchers analyzed the conductivities as functions of the angle between the Néel vectors, considering both strong and weak magnetic anisotropy phases. They also introduced a normal metal layer between the MA materials and observed the resulting Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations in charge conductance.

Result: In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as the angle approaches $	heta = 	ext{arcsin(1)}$. In the weak AM phase, the charge conductivity remains finite. The insertion of a normal metal between two MA materials induces Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations in charge conductance. In the strong MA phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, while in the weak MA phase, both spin channels contribute to the transport.

Conclusion: These results demonstrate the potential of MA-based heterostructures for spintronic applications where spin-dependent transport and interference effects are significant. The controllability of these effects through the angle $	heta$ opens promising avenues for the design and optimization of spintronic devices.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two
AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities
are analyzed as functions of angle between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs
$\theta$. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta
\to \pi$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal
metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge
conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons,
whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase. These results
highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic
applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic
devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be
utilized in electronic devices.

TL;DR: Hybrid altermagnets can exhibit second-order anomalous Hall currents driven by Berry curvature, with their properties dependent on the underlying symmetry of the altermagnetic order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding unconventional transport properties of altermagnets is key for advancing spintronic applications.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet interpolating between d_{x^2-y^2} and d_{xy} symmetries.

Result: The Hall current is second-order and tunable by adjusting the relative orientation of symmetry-reducing fields.

Conclusion: Hybrid altermagnets offer a promising platform for controllable nonlinear transport and spintronic applications due to their symmetry-dependent second-order Hall response.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of compensated magnets with
momentum-dependent spin splittings and unusual transport properties, even
without a net magnetization. In the presence of combined four-fold rotation and
time-reversal ($C_4\mathcal{T}$) symmetry, linear and also second-order, driven
by a Berry curvature dipole, anomalous Hall responses are forbidden in any pure
$d$-wave altermagnet. Nevertheless, here we find that the nontrivial quantum
metric of the occupied Bloch states allows for an electric field induced Berry
curvature dipole, which generates a strong and tunable second-order Hall
current, enabling it to be switched on or off by simply adjusting the relative
orientation between the symmetry-reducing dc field and the ac probe field.
Specifically, we investigate the electric field induced second-order anomalous
Hall response in a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet that
interpolates between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ ($B_{1g}$) and $d_{xy}$ ($B_{2g}$)
altermagnet symmetry, motivated by recent proposals for mixed-symmetry states.
Crucially, the nonlinear signal is highly sensitive to the underlying symmetry
of the altermagnetic order at specific doping levels, offering a purely
electrical method to distinguish distinct altermagnetic orders. Our results
position hybrid altermagnets as a promising platform for controllable nonlinear
transport and spintronic applications.

*L. Basseto,N. P. Vizarim,J. C. Bellizotti Souza,P. A. Venegas*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper investigates how mixed pinning sites, including attractive and repulsive defects, affect the behavior of skyrmions in a square lattice. By studying these effects, the authors provide guidelines for controlling skyrmion dynamics and optimizing skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skyrmions, as stable topological solitons, are promising candidates for use in next-generation memory and logic devices due to their robustness and potential for all-write capabilities. This paper aims to understand and control their behavior through defect-induced pinning effects.

Method: A particle-based model is employed to simulate the dynamics of a single skyrmion in a square lattice. The model incorporates both attractive and repulsive defects, and their effects on skyrmion motion are systematically investigated.

Result: The results show that weaker attraction reduces the depinning threshold, while stronger repulsion can stabilize the directional locking at -45° and broaden the locking plateau. Combining different strengths of attraction and repulsion allows control over the directional lockings and the force ranges. The size of defects further tunes the response, enabling selection among different angles such as -45°, -50°, -55°, and approximately -59°. These findings offer a practical approach to steer skyrmion trajectories and optimize the effective Hall response, which is crucial for designing skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed understanding of the role of mixed pinning sites in controlling skyrmion dynamics and offers design guidelines for optimizing skyrmion-based devices.

Abstract: We investigate the driven dynamics of a single skyrmion in a square lattice
of mixed pinning sites, where attractive and repulsive defects coexist using a
particle-based model. The mixed landscape yields directional locking at
$\theta_{\rm sk}=-45^\circ$ and flow at locked angles near the intrinsic
skyrmion Hall angle. By mapping defect strengths, we show that weaker
attraction lowers the depinning threshold, whereas stronger repulsion
stabilizes and broadens the $-45^\circ$ locking plateau. Moreover, combinations
of attractive and repulsive defect strengths allows control of directional
lockings and their force ranges. Defect size further tunes the response,
selecting among $-45^\circ$, $-50^\circ$, $-55^\circ$, and $\approx-59^\circ$.
These results establish mixed pinning as a practical knob to steer skyrmion
trajectories and the effective Hall response, providing design guidelines for
skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.
