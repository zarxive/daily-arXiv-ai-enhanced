Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) pose a critical challenge in densely populated
cities and tropical climates where large amounts of energy are used to meet the
cooling demand. To address this, Building and Construction Authority (BCA) of
Singapore provides incentives for passive cooling such as using of
solar-reflective material in its Green Mark guidelines. Thus, understanding
about its real-world effectiveness in tropical urban environments is required.
This study evaluated the effectiveness of solar-reflective cool paint using a
hybrid modelling framework combining a transient physical model and data driven
model through field measurements. Several machine learning algorithms were
compared including multiple-linear regression (MLR), random forest regressor
(RF), AdaBoost regressor (AB), extreme gradient boosting regressor (XGB), and
TabPFN regressor (TPR). The results indicated that the transient physical model
overestimated facade temperatures in the lower temperature ranges. The
physics-informed MLR achieved best performance with improved accuracy for
pre-cool paint (R2=0.96, RMSE=0.83C) and post-cool paint (R2=0.95, RMSE=0.65C)
scenarios, reducing RMSE by 26% and 44%, respectively. The hybrid model also
effectively predicted hourly heat fluxes revealing substantial reductions in
surface temperature and heat storage with increasing albedo. The maximum net
heat flux q_net was reduced by about 30-65 W/m2 in the post-cool paint stage
(albedo = 0.73) compared to the pre-cool paint stage (albedo = 0.31). As albedo
increases from 0.1 to 0.9, the sensitivity analysis predicts that the maximum
daytime surface temperature will decrease by about 11C and the peak heat
release of the net heat flux will decrease significantly from about 161 W/m2 to
27 W/m2.

### [2] [Quantifying Key Design Factors for Thermal Comfort in Underground Space Through Global Sensitivity Analysis and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16202)
*Shisheng Chen,Nyuk Hien Wong,Chao Cen,Ruohan Xu,Lei Xu,Zhenjiang Shen,Zhigang Wua,Jiayan Fu,Zhongqi Yu*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 文章研究了福州这种高湿 subtropical 现象地区自然通风地下空间在高温条件下的热舒适性关键设计因素，结果显示地下空间在高效率热环境中，仅依靠自然通风可能不足以改善热舒适性，提供了优化设计的参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researching thermal comfort in naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperatures is crucial for urban planning and energy efficiency, especially in cities with extreme heat like Fuzhou。

Method:  statistical analysis and modeling using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and sensitivity analysis were employed to determine the factors affecting thermal comfort。

Result:  underground spaces showed better thermal stability than pedestrian levels, with lower PET values, while pedestrian areas had higher variability due to direct and diffuse solar radiation。

Conclusion:  thermo-Physically， underground spaces can be an effective heat shelter， especially during transitions and cooling periods， but natural ventilation alone may not meet thermal comfort needs in high heat environments like Fuzhou。HVAC systems may still be necessary for cooling。

Abstract: This study identified the key design factors related to thermal comfort in
naturally ventilated underground spaces under high temperature condition
(outdoor Tmax = 42.9$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) in Fuzhou, China. Fuzhou has a humid
subtropical climate and is one of the three hottest cities in China in 2024.
The reference roof measurement point showed the highest heat exposure (36.3%
>35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) followed by pedestrian-level areas (20.4%
>35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$), while the underground remained consistently cooler (0%
>35$^\circ\mathrm{C}$). Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed significant
differences (p < 0.001) in environmental conditions (e.g., AT, GT, MRT, V, RH).
Underground spaces showed the most stable and lowest PET (mean PET =
35.4$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) due to high thermal mass and shading, although moderate
to intense thermal stresses still existed. Pedestrian-level spaces displayed
greater PET variation (mean = 37.4$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) influenced by direct and
diffuse solar radiation, while roofs suffered from extreme heat stress (mean
PET = 40.6$^\circ\mathrm{C}$) peaking at 100% frequency from 9:00 to 14:00.
Four distinct periods including early morning transition, evening transition,
cooling, and heat stressing were identified for optimal underground space
utilization as heat shelter. The global sensitivity analysis showed that
variations in MET explained 60% of the variance in PET within the underground
environment, followed by AT (20%), V (10%), MRT (5%), and RH (5%). The partial
dependence analysis indicated that PET in underground space rose by
approximately 7$^\circ\mathrm{C}$ when MET increased from 1 to 5 met, while a 1
m/s rise in V led to a 2$^\circ\mathrm{C}$ reduction in PET, suggesting shaded
areas with good ventilation can significantly improve thermal comfort even if
AT remains moderately high.

### [3] [High-efficiency atmospheric water harvesting enabled by ultrasonic extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16684)
*Ikra Shuvo,Carlos D. Diaz-Marin,Marvin Christen,Michael Lherbette,Christopher Liem,Svetlana V. Boriskina*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates atmospheric water harvesting can extract 45x more efficiently using vibrations instead of heat, breaking the energy efficiency barrier of thermal evaporation, making it economically feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric water harvesting is a potential solution to water scarcity, but high energy costs using thermal methods hinder its implementation. This paper proposes a novel method using vibrations, which offers a significant improvement in energy efficiency.

Method: The authors used vibrocantilever-based actuation to extract water without heat, increasing efficiency by 45-fold and demonstrating energy consumption below evaporation enthalpy.

Result: The system's efficiency surpasses thermal evaporation energy limits, showing the concept's technological feasibility.

Conclusion: Vibrational methods enable atmospheric water harvesting with sufficient efficiency, making it cost-effective.

Abstract: Atmospheric water harvesting technology, which extracts moisture from ambient
air to generate water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water
production. However, the prohibitively high energy consumption of heat-induced
evaporation process of water extraction hinders the technology deployment. Here
we demonstrate that vibrational mechanical actuation can be used instead of
heat to extract water from moisture harvesting materials, offering about
forty-five-fold increase in the extraction energy efficiency. We report the
energy consumption for water extraction below the enthalpy of water
evaporation, thus breaking the thermal limit of the energy efficiency inherent
to the state-of-the-art thermal evaporation and making atmospheric water
harvesting technology economically feasible for adoption on scale.

*G. K. Vong,V. A. Dzuba,V. V. Flambaum*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method combining linearised coupled-cluster, configuration interaction, and perturbation theory to calculate energy levels and ionisation potentials for superheavy elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate theoretical data on the electronic structure of superheavy elements, which are challenging due to their high atomic number.

Method: Linearised coupled-cluster method, configuration interaction, and perturbation theory are combined in a theoretical framework to compute ionisation potentials and energy levels.

Result: The method effectively addresses gaps in data for superheavy elements while performing well for lighter homologues with available experimental data.

Conclusion: The combined approach provides reliable results, demonstrating potential applicability to other superheavy elements.

Abstract: We calculate the energy levels and successive ionisation potentials (IPs) of
ions of the three heaviest known Group 16 and 17 elements using a theoretical
approach that combines the linearised coupled-cluster method, configuration
interaction, and perturbation theory. Our calculations address critical gaps in
the available data on the electronic structure of the superheavy elements
livermorium (Lv) and tennessine (Ts), as well as their lighter homologues
polonium (Po) and astatine (At). To assess the accuracy of our methods, we
perform analogous calculations for the lighter homologues tellurium (Te) and
iodine (I), for which both experimental and reliable theoretical data are
available for comparison.

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents precise measurements of the Lande g-factors for certain hyperfine levels in Lu+ and uses these along with theory to find the residual quadrupole moment of a clock transition with a precision of about 0.34%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper contributes to understanding hyperfine structure in heavy atoms, which is essential for precision metrology and testing fundamental interactions through clock transitions.

Method: They measured g-factors with high precision and combined them with theoretical calculations to estimate the residual quadrupole moment of clock transition.

Result: Precise measurements and calculation give δΘ in the ~0.34% range.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding for advancing atomic clocks and precision physics experiments.

Abstract: We report measurements of the Lande g-factors for the 5d6s $^3$D$_2$
hyperfine levels of $^{176}$Lu$^+$ to a fractional inaccuracy of $5\times
10^{-7}$. Combining these measurements with theoretical calculations allows us
to estimate hyperfine-mediated modifications to the quadrupole moments for each
state and infer a value of $\delta\Theta = 1.59(34)\times 10^{-4} \,ea_0^2$ for
the residual quadrupole moment of the $^1S_0\leftrightarrow{^3}D_2$
hyperfine-averaged clock transition.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to advance understanding of subradiant populations and their decay dynamics in alkaline earth atoms, potentially offering new tools for imaging cold atomic systems.

Method: They employed a V-type internal energy structure-based depletion imaging and performed time- and space-resolved measurements. Simulations of two-level ensembles were used to validate their findings.

Result: The decay dynamics of subradiant modes matched numerical predictions.

Conclusion: This experimental method successfully characterizes subradiant decay, validated by simulations, contributing to the study of neutral cold atoms.

Abstract: In this letter, we report on the time- and space-resolved measurement of
subradiant excited state population in an ultra-cold atomic cloud of 174Yb
atoms. We use a depletion imaging technique that exploits the V-type internal
energy structure of alkaline-earth-like atoms to directly observe the
time-resolved spatial distribution of excited state population. We characterize
the decay dynamics of the subradiant modes using both the excited state
population and scattered light intensity, finding good quantitative agreement
with numerical predictions from simulations of two-level atomic ensembles.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究了德萨得里夫量子引力极限中的宇宙学相关函数，发现在这种极限下，状态和观测量仍需满足德萨得里夫不变性。通过对偶论计算方法和特定状态条件下观测量的表现，探索了这种量子引力下与普通量子场论不同的方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究极限情况下的量子引力相关函数行为，特别是与普通QFT的差异性。

Method: 使用对偶理论和特定计算方法进行分析，结合状态条件下的观测量构造。

Result: 在G_N趋近于零的情况下，构造了新的量子引力下相关函数的具体形式，发现与普通QFT的非高斯特征。

Conclusion: 量子引力在G_N趋近极限下的相关函数表现出特殊的构造方式，可以通过特定状态条件下的观测量模拟普通QFT行为。

Abstract: We study cosmological correlators in de Sitter quantum gravity in the limit
where $G_N \to 0$. This limit is distinct from a nongravitational QFT because
the gravitational constraints still force states and observables to be de
Sitter invariant. We first examine a class of perturbative correlators that, in
gauge-fixed form, are represented by the expectation value of a product of
elementary fields on the late-time boundary. We formulate Feynman rules for our
computations and enumerate some necessary, but not sufficient, conditions that
must be imposed on states and operators to avoid group-volume divergences.
These correlators are conformally invariant in all allowed perturbative states
but never coincide with QFT vacuum-expectation values. For instance, our sample
computations yield interesting non-Gaussianities even when the underlying
vacuum wavefunction is Gaussian. However, we show that, in the presence of a
heavy background state, it is possible to construct a separate class of
state-dependent relational observables whose values approximate QFT correlators
in the vacuum. This illustrates a key contrast in quantum gravity -- between
observables that are microscopically simple and observables whose expectation
values in an appropriate background state lead to simple QFT-like correlators.

### [8] [On string theory on (deformed) $AdS_3\times \mathbb{T}^3$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15929)
*Soumangsu Chakraborty,Amit Giveon*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper revisits fermionic string theory in a specific AdS3×T3 setup, focusing on its T̄T deformation. They show a duality between this theory and a symmetric product SCFT, particularly in the k=1 limit. They identify certain operators that correspond to those in the dual spacetime and demonstrate consistency between their properties. The results suggest a deeper understanding of the AdS/CFT correspondence under T̄T deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aims to explore the AdS/CFT correspondence, specifically in the context of T̄T deformations, which are a well-studied area in holography and integrable systems. The motivation is probably to deepen our understanding of how deformations affect the holographic duality and the correspondence between worldsheet operators in string theory and bulk fields in the AdS space.

Method: The approach likely combines string theory techniques with holographic methods. They use the structure of the worldsheet theory, particularly focusing on delta-function normalizable operators. By taking the k=1 limit, they decouple certain modes and relate them to a simpler bulk geometry. The method probably involves matching the worldsheet operators with the expected bulk fields in the T̄T-deformed theory.

Result: The result probably identifies specific operators in the fermionic string theory that correspond to those in the bulk, particularly in the deformed space R×T^3. They might have shown that these operators reproduce the expected properties and behavior in the bulk dual. The finding suggests a concrete correspondence between the worldsheet and bulk physics in the deformed setup.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely strengthens the understanding that T̄T deformations provide a tool to study corrections to AdS/CFT, specifically in this AdS3 setup. They probably conclude that the duality holds in this deformed context, and the worldsheet operators accurately reflect the bulk physics. The conclusion might suggest future research directions in exploring similar deformations in other AdS setups or studying the implications for integrability and holography.

Abstract: We revisit the fermionic string theory on $AdS_3\times \mathcal{N}$ with
$k=1$, and its single-trace $T\bar T$ deformation, with a focus on the $(2,2)$
superstring on (deformed) $AdS_3\times \mathbb{T}^3$. In a certain limit, it is
dual to the symmetric product of the ($T\bar T$-deformed) SCFT$_2$ on
$\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^3$. We present the winding-one delta-function
normalizable worldsheet operators which, in the $k=1$ decoupling limit,
correspond to those of $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{T}^3$ in spacetime. We then
demonstrate how their properties in string theory reproduce those of
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}^3$, or more generally, of a ($T\bar{T}$-deformed)
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathcal{N}$ seed of the boundary theory.

TL;DR: 研究发现了新的二维电动力学的对偶不变理论家族，通过两种方法构建。第一种方法能从一个原始的对偶不变理论生成一个一参数的精确对偶不变族，参数非负时保持因果性。第二种方法引入了纯场项，保留了恰当的麦克斯韦极限。

Motivation: 研究者希望扩展电动力学的理论框架，找到新的对偶不变模型，可能有助于更深入理解电动力学的对称性及其应用。

Method: 第一种方法通过算法从单一的对偶不变理论构建若干个对偶不变理论。第二种方法加入了新的纯场项，增强了理论体系。

Result: 发现了新的对偶不变电动力学的两个家族，其中一个保留麦克斯韦极限，另一种保持因果性。

Conclusion: 新的对偶模型为电动力学理论的发展提供了新的方向和可能性。

Abstract: We identify new families of duality-invariant theories of electrodynamics. We
achieve this in two different ways. On the one hand, we present an algorithm to
construct a one-parameter family of exactly duality-invariant theories from a
single seed duality-invariant theory. If the seed theory is causal, the
theories constructed from this method will also be causal when the parameter is
non-negative. On the other hand, we find two additional novel families of
duality-invariant theories which include a nonzero term independent of the
electromagnetic field. The first of them generalizes Bialynicki-Birula
electrodynamics, while the second family of theories features a well-defined
Maxwell limit as the term independent of the gauge field strength is sent to
zero.

### [10] [A Partially Massless Superconductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15932)
*Kurt Hinterbichler,Austin Joyce*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton using a covariant fracton-like effective theory on de Sitter space, which linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. They gauge the global symmetry by coupling to a partially massless spin-2 gauge field. When matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is broken, leading to a galileon mode, making the graviton fully massive. Long-distance behavior shows quasi-topological features, similar to superconducting phases, with gapless edge modes and persistent currents. The mechanism is generalized to higher spins as well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how to make partially massless gravitons gain mass through a Higgs-like mechanism is crucial for exploring the behavior of massless particles in quantum gravity and cosmological settings. This paper likely contributes to resolving issues in theories where gravitons are either massless or have modified mass terms, possibly offering insights into early universe cosmology or quantum gravity phenomenology.

Method: The authors construct a covariant effective theory with dipolar shift symmetry on de Sitter space. They linearly realize the symmetry by coupling to a partially massless gauge field. Condensing matter breaks the symmetry, leading to gapless modes and persistent currents, akin to superconductors.

Result: Various results are obtained, including the mass gaining of the graviton, spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to galileon modes, and the quasi-topological field theory exhibiting behaviors similar to superconductors, such as gapless edge modes and persistent currents. The formalism is extended to higher spins, broadening the applicability of their method.

Conclusion: This mechanism provides a promising framework for partially massless gravitons to acquire mass, with implications for cosmological models and quantum gravity theories. The findings suggest deep connections between condensed matter physics phenomena and high-energy gravity theories, hinting at potential unifying principles or new approaches to tackle long-standing problems in theoretical physics.

Abstract: We describe a Higgs mechanism for the partially massless graviton. In order
to do so, we first construct a covariant fracton-like effective field theory on
de Sitter space that linearly realizes a dipolar shift symmetry. The global
symmetry of this theory can be gauged by coupling it to a partially massless
spin-2 gauge field. When the fractonic matter condenses, the dipole symmetry is
spontaneously broken, the resulting Goldstone mode is a galileon and the
partially massless graviton combines with this mode and becomes fully massive.
At long distances, the phenomenology of this theory is captured by a
quasi-topological field theory and displays many features analogous to those of
the superconducting phase in electromagnetism, including gapless edge modes and
persistent currents. We also describe the generalization to higher spins.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We define a notion of `quantum entanglement index' with the aim to compute it
for black hole horizons in string theory at one-loop order using the stringy
replica method. We consider the horizon of BTZ black holes to construct the
relevant conical orbifolds, labeled by an odd integer $N$, and compute the
partition function as a function of $N$, corresponding to the fractional
indexed R\'enyi entropy. We show that it is free of tachyons and naturally
finite both in the ultraviolet and the infrared, even though it is generically
ultraviolet divergent in the field theory limit. Thus, the index provides a
useful diagnostic of the entanglement structure of string theory without the
need for analytic continuation in $N$.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析当前Hamiltonian截断方法的收敛性问题，寻找一种系统性的方法来改进其结果。

Method: 使用Effective Field Theory的方法构建截断的Hamiltonian，通过1/E_max展开计算高阶修正项，并验证了这些修正的有效性。

Result: 计算了1+1维λφ^4理论中1/E_max^3的修正项，引入了非局部项，误差缩小至1/E_max^4，表明方法有效。

Conclusion: 该框架HTET系统而可靠，能够提高Hamiltonian截断的收敛性，并应用于更高维度和更复杂系统。

Abstract: Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory is a framework that aims to improve
the results of Hamiltonian truncation in a systematic, order-by-order fashion
using Effective Field Theory methodology. The result is a truncated effective
Hamiltonian with corrections that result from a matching procedure. We
establish the rigor of this method by calculating nontrival next-to-leading
order corrections in a $1/E_{\rm max}$ expansion, where $E_{\rm max}$ is our
effective theory cutoff. We illustrate this explicitly using 1+1D $\lambda
\phi^4$ theory, calculating corrections up to order $1/E_{\rm max}^3$. At this
order, novel nonlocal contributions to the matching conditions must be
incorporated. We show that by including these nonlocal terms, the error scales
as $1/E_{\rm max}^4$, as expected from the Effective Field Theory power
counting, providing a nontrivial check that this method is consistent and
robust. We also estimate the critical coupling at which this theory flows to
the 2D Ising conformal field theory and confirm that separation of scales, an
essential feature of Effective Field Theory, persists at this order. These
results establish Hamiltonian Truncation Effective Theory as a generic,
systematic framework for improving convergence in Hamiltonian truncation and
lay the groundwork to apply this method to more complex systems in higher
dimensions.

Method: 文章使用了两种不同振荡器模型（自旋1的玻色子和费米子模型）来构建带电粒子的世界线量子化。通过Dirac和BRST方法对玻色子模型进行了量子化，成功导出了Proca场论，并在引入电磁场后证明了BRST电荷的无平方性导致Maxwell方程的有效性。接着构建了路径积分，并计算了环效应下的真空不稳定性和产率。最终将结果与标准N=2绕子模型进行了比较，结果一致。

Result: 研究结果表明，基于玻色子和费米子模型的量子化方法在处理自旋-1粒子和电磁场的相互作用时是有效的，得到的环效应预测与传统场论结果一致，支持了这种世界线形式的有效性。

Conclusion: 文章成功展示了如何通过世界线量子化方法研究 spin-1 粒子与电磁场的相互作用，结果与传统方法匹配，验证了该形式在量子场论中的适用性，并探讨了其扩展的可能性。

Abstract: We investigate a worldline formulation for a massive spin-1 particle
interacting with an electromagnetic background. Two first-quantized
descriptions of the spin degrees of freedom are considered: one based on
bosonic oscillators and the other on fermionic oscillators. Focusing initially
on the bosonic model -- which can accommodate particles of arbitrary integer
spin -- we review how quantization in the spin-1 sector, performed both via
Dirac's method and BRST quantization, reproduces the free Proca field theory.
We then introduce coupling to an external electromagnetic field and demonstrate
that Maxwell's equations for the background emerge as a consistency condition
for the nilpotency of the BRST charge on the spin-1 sector. Encouraged by this
result, which proves the viability of the particle model, we proceed to
construct a path integral quantization of the worldline action for the charged
spin-1 particle on the circle. This yields the one-loop effective Lagrangian
for a constant electromagnetic field induced by a massive charged vector boson.
As expected, the result reveals a vacuum instability, which we quantify by
deriving the pair production rate for the vector bosons, recovering previous
results obtained in quantum field theory. For comparison, we repeat the
analysis using the standard $\mathcal{N}=2$ spinning particle model, which
contains fermionic worldline degrees of freedom, finding identical results.
Finally, we comment on possible extensions of the worldline models to include
effective interactions and briefly explore their implications for pair
production.

Abstract: In this work, we derive a novel set of equations - the Asymptotic
Baxter--Bethe Ansatz - that determine the asymptotic spectrum of Regge
trajectories in the BFKL regime of N=4 SYM. In this challenging limit, our
method yields multi-loop results in the 't Hooft coupling, with the
perturbative accuracy increasing as the quantum numbers grow. Our formalism not
only provides a straightforward path to obtain multi-loop perturbative data, as
we demonstrate, but also enables the classification of trajectories, paving the

Abstract: We show that baryon number symmetry is spontaneously broken in a class of

spectrum. These models serve as lower-dimensional, less-supersymmetric analogs
of the Klebanov-Strassler solution, sharing properties such as the presence of
a cascade. The spontaneous symmetry breaking is evidenced by the appearance of
a Goldstone mode, which corresponds to a vector fluctuation in the gravity
dual.

*Behnam Pourhassan*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Key findings include non-linear Aretakis instability in extremal black p-branes, critical behavior determined by spacetime and brane dimensions, universal scaling near instability thresholds across observables, and a holographic connection to quantum information dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores a critical phenomenon in extremal black p-branes, offering insights into non-linear dynamics and holography.

Method: Combines analytical scaling with numerical simulations in near-horizon geometries; uses AdS/CFT correspondence for dual field theory computations.

Result: Universal scaling exponents dependent on D and p; critical dynamics near instability thresholds; power-law evolution to attractors; singular growth for supercritical perturbations; and agreement across various observables like entanglement entropy and correlation functions.

Conclusion: Establishes a framework linking geometric instability to quantum information in holographic systems, suggesting broader implications for strongly coupled systems.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive investigation of the non-linear evolution
of the Aretakis instability in extremal black $p$-branes. Building on recent
insights into the linear behavior of perturbations in near-horizon AdS$_{p+2}
\times S^{D-p-2}$ geometries, we explore the full non-linear regime using a
combination of analytical scaling arguments and numerical simulations. We
uncover a universal critical behavior governed by scaling exponents that depend
only on the spacetime dimension $D$ and the brane worldvolume dimension $p$.
Near the threshold of instability, the system exhibits power-law evolution
toward dynamically generated extremal attractors, while supercritical
perturbations lead to singular growth. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, we
compute entanglement entropy, correlation functions, spectral densities, and
out-of-time-ordered correlators in the dual field theory, finding universal
scaling across all observables. These results establish a deep connection
between geometric instability in the bulk and quantum information dynamics on
the boundary. The emergence of universal scaling and phase transitions in
extremal geometries suggests that non-linear Aretakis dynamics may serve as a
general framework for studying holographic criticality and late-time behavior
in strongly coupled systems.

Result: 在3维中，两Loop和三Loop消失，而在更高维中数目增加，表明一Loop精确性。

Conclusion: 三维引力在一Loop精确性中是独特的，更高维则复杂得多。

Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that the two- and three-loop contributions to
the partition function of three-dimensional gravity in flat space vanish. This
is in agreement with the expected one-loop exactness dictated by the underlying
symmetry at the quantum level. To highlight the distinctive nature of the $D=3$
case, we extend the three-loop computation to arbitrary spacetime dimensions
$D$. In higher dimensions, the number of contributions increases substantially,
reinforcing the view that one-loop exactness is a unique feature of
three-dimensional gravity.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Kappa-Minkowski spacetime has positive and negative energy modes with different symmetries, possibly suggesting a deformed CPT invariance. Abstract explores this using canonical formalism and calculates Noether charges under deformed discrete symmetries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the symmetries in kappa-deformed spacetime and their implications for CPT invariance could lead to a better grasp of quantum spacetime and quantum gravity theories.

Method: The paper uses the canonical formalism, calculates Noether charges for continuous symmetries, and examines their behavior under deformed discrete symmetries like time reversal.

Result: The study reveals that although continuous symmetries are deformed, CPT invariance can be restored through deformed discrete symmetry transformations, indicating a possible consistency in the kappa-deformed framework.

Conclusion: CPT invariance might still hold in a deformed form, supporting the idea of a consistent noncommutative spacetime framework without violating fundamental symmetries.

Abstract: The positive and negative energy modes of a field theory in
$\kappa$-Minkowski/$\kappa$-Poincar\'e noncommutative spacetime have very
different symmetry properties. This can be understood geometrically by
considering that they span two distinct sectors of a curved momentum space. It
seems that because of this asymmetry, charge conjugation and Poincar\'e
invariance are incompatible. However, the structure of momentum space suggests
that time reversal could be deformed so that the overall CPT-invariance is
restored. We test these features by calculating explicitly the whole set of
Noether charges associated with continuous relativistic symmetries within the
canonical formalism, and study their transformation properties under deformed
discrete symmetries.

Abstract: We study correlators in two-dimensional $T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field
theories by interpreting the $T\bar{T}$ deformation as a coupling to
two-dimensional gravity. To demonstrate the utility of the massive gravity
framework as a particular realization of the gravitational interpretation, we
show how the $T\bar{T}$-deformed correlators at finite coupling can be computed
by adopting a judicious parametrization of the 2D metric and a preferred choice
of zweibeins. To illustrate how this method works in practice, we compute the
leading logarithmic contributions to two- and three-point functions to all
orders in the $T\bar{T}$ coupling, reproducing a known result while producing
new findings. This framework generalizes the random geometry approach to finite
coupling.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子场论与 condensed matter physics 的结合提供新的视角，丰富了边界效应在不同物理领域的应用。

Abstract: The scope of this Ph.D thesis is to study the effects of the presence of a
boundary from a Quantum Field Theoretical perspective, searching for new
physics and explanations of observed phenomena. In particular, thanks to the
formal QFT setting, the issue of the existence of local, accelerated, edge
modes in Hall systems is analyzed and understood in terms of the
bulk-to-boundary approach as related to a curved background in topological QFTs
with boundary. Within this formalism the induced metric on the boundary can be
associated to the ad hoc potential introduced in the phenomenological models in
order to obtain such non-constant edge velocities. This also leads to the
prediction of local modes for Topological Insulators, and Quantum Spin Hall
systems in general. The paradigm for which only topological QFTs have a
physical content on the boundary is broken, and also non-Topological Quantum
Field Theories such as fracton models and Linearized Gravity are shown to have
non-trivial boundary dynamics. Indeed due to the breaking of their defining
symmetry both models have a current algebra of the Kac-Moody type on the
boundary. In the case of fractons this algebra is in a generalized form, which
also appears in some kinds of higher order Topological Insulators, a sign of a
possible relation between these materials and edge states of fracton
quasiparticles. Concerning the theory of Linearized Gravity, instead, the
algebra is a standard Kac-Moody one, whose presence was suspected, but never
proved before. Physical results on the boundary range between condensed matter,
elasticity and (massive) gravity models. A collateral result, which enrich this
Thesis, is the building of a new covariant QFT for fractons with a peculiar
gauge structure. This new model better highlight the properties of these
quasiparticles.

Result: 发现距离变短时，相关函数表现出振荡和快速衰减，类似于量子引力中的量子效应。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解 Planckian 物理提供了新视角，可能促进量子引力和场论研究的发展。

Abstract: We propose a nonperturbative completion of two-point correlators in
$T\bar{T}$-deformed conformal field theories (CFTs), and analyze their behavior
at distance scales shorter than the fundamental length scale set by the
$T\bar{T}$ deformation. Building on the interpretation of the $T\bar{T}$
deformation as a coupling to two-dimensional quantum gravity with a unique
built-in length scale, we advance the study of $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs as a
toy model for Planckian physics. As we probe shorter distances, trans-Planckian
oscillations are followed by a super-Planckian regime in which correlations are
typically suppressed by geometric randomness, in contrast to the power-law
growth characteristic of CFTs. Moreover, their dependence on distance becomes
exponentially weaker, suggesting that the underlying geometric structure has
been largely erased -- a behavior broadly consistent with expectations for
quantum spacetime in this regime.

Result: 统一框架下，不仅解释了已知的异常，还发现了新的异常类型。

Conclusion: 这种方法统一了各类异常，对于超共形理论中异常的研究有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a unified topological description of anomalies that generalizes
the Chern-Simons formulation of Yang-Mills anomalies to encompass all
4-dimensional superconformal anomalies. The key innovation is our
characterization of anomalies through the constraint ideal in the polynomial
ring of generalized curvatures and connections of the underlying symmetry
(super)-Lie algebra.
  We demonstrate that anomalies in dimension $d$ are captured by the cohomology
$H_\delta(W_{d+2})$ of the generalized BRST operator $\delta$ acting on the
fermion number $d+2$ component of the constraint ideal $W_{d+2}$. While
Yang-Mills anomalies correspond to invariant Chern curvature polynomials (where
$W_{d+2}$ reduces to homogeneous curvature polynomials), the constraint ideal
for 4D (super)conformal gravity contains additional polynomials mixing
curvatures and connections. This richer structure naturally explains the
coexistence of both Chern-type ($a$) and non-Chern-type ($c$) anomalies in
(super)conformal theories.

Abstract: The Casimir effect is considered a great triumph of Quantum Field Theory.
Originally the Casimir energy was investigated considering the vacuum
fluctuation associated with electromagnetic field; however it has also been
analyzed considering different type of quantum fields. More recently the
Casimir energy was studied in the context of Lorentz symmetry violation. In
this work we investigate the effect of finite temperature on the Casmir energy
considering a Lorenttz violation symmetry in a Horava-Lifshitz scenario. In
this sense we consider a massive scalar quantum field confined in a region
between two large and parallel plates. So our main objective is to investigate
how, in this Lorentz violation scenario (LV), the Casimir energy depends on the
temperature. Another point to be analyzed, is influence of the parameter
associated with the LV, $\xi$, in the thermal correction.

Conclusion: 在 BTZ 黑洞环境下，UDW 检测器的热化过程存在显著的量子不对称性，且黑洞自转对该过程有明显的影响。

Abstract: We address the problem of the thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt
(UDW) detector outside a BTZ black hole, from a perspective of quantum
thermodynamics. In the context of an open quantum system, we derive the
complete dynamics of the detector, which encodes a complicated response to
scalar background fields. Using various information theory tools, such as
quantum relative entropy, quantum heat, coherence, quantum Fisher information,
and quantum speed of evolution, we examined three quantum thermodynamic laws
for the UDW detector, where the influences from BTZ angular momentum and
Hawking radiation are investigated. In particular, based on information
geometry theory, we find an intrinsic asymmetry in the detector's
thermolization process as it undergoes Hawking radiation from the BTZ black
hole. In particular, we find that the detector consistently heats faster than
it cools, analogous to the quantum Mpemba effect for nonequilibrium systems.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the spin of a black hole significantly influences
the magnitude of the asymmetry, while preserving the dominance of heating over
cooling.

### [25] [Entanglement Entropy of Quantum Corners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16800)

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores quantum corner symmetries and their algebras in the context of 2D gravity, computing entanglement entropy for various states including vacuum and coherent states, particularly in JT gravity. The results suggest entropy is related to quantum information and scales with the dilaton, offering support for the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum cornersČ ruins it by misspelling corrections.)settle on the quantum informational interpretation of entropy in this setup. However, some key terms are misspelled, like 'algebras' and 'semiclassical'. The overall result still supports quantum information theory in gravitational physics but with minor linguistic errors and possible conceptual oversights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates quantum corner symmetries and their implications for entropy in 2D gravity, particularly in JT gravity and black holes, using entanglement entropy as a tool. The motivation is to bridge quantum information theory with gravitational physics to understand entropy's quantum origin.

Method: The authors use the covariant phase space formalism and quantum representations of corners to study entanglement entropy. They consider vacuum and coherent states, compute entropy scaling, and apply results to JT gravity and general states, deriving an entropy formula based on representation theory.

Result: The quantum corner symmetries and their algebras are shown to underpin entanglement entropy, with coherent states scaling like the dilaton. Suitable for quantum informational studies. However, some terms are misspelled, e.g., 'algebras' and 'semiclassical', and the underlying quantum gravity setup is not entirely clarified. Still, the results cement the quantum informational aspect of entropy.

Conclusion: These findings enhance our understanding of entropy in quantum gravity through quantum information theory, despite minor issues with terminology and methodology. The approach can inspire further research into quantum gravity and black hole entropy.

Abstract: In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become
physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase
space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter
localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts
that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any
quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum
corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and
quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum
representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do
so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined.
We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of
$4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement
entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a
semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the
semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum
informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general
states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement
entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.

### [26] [Convergent perturbative series via finite path integral limits: application to energy at strong coupling of the anharmonic oscillator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08782)
*Ariel Edery*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that finite path integral limits yield a convergent perturbative series for strong coupling in quantum anharmonic oscillators and λφ⁴ theory in 0+1D, with results matching exact solutions remarkably well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in quantum field theory: solving theories at strong coupling, where traditional perturbation methods fail. It proposes a novel approach using finite path integrals that yield convergent series, which is a significant advancement in the field.

Method: The authors modify the path integral by introducing finite limits of integration, effectively adding infinite walls to the potential. This allows perturbative series in the coupling constant to be absolutely convergent even at strong coupling. The method is applied to λφ⁴ theory in 0+0 and 0+1 dimensions and the quantum anharmonic oscillator in 0+1 dimensions. Perturbative series are computed for ground state energy across varying coupling strengths and compared with exact results. The method is validated by showing agreement within 0.1% at strong coupling.

Result: The study shows that finite path integrals produce a rapidly converging series for strong coupling scenarios. For the 0+1D quantum anharmonic oscillator, the method's perturbative results match the exact energy up to 0.1% when expanded to 5th order. Similar results are obtained for λφ⁴ theory in 0+0 dimensions, confirming the approach's validity. In weak coupling, the results align with perturbative calculations, while at intermediate and strong coupling, they outperform traditional asymptotic series which diverge.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel perturbative method rooted in finite path integrals that effectively addresses strong coupling issues. By confining the system within finite boundaries, the authors achieve perturbative convergence, offering a promising alternative to traditional asymptotic series. The method's success in both 0+0 and 0+1 dimensions demonstrates its broad applicability, with clear implications for solving strongly coupled quantum field theories and related problems in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Solving quantum field theories at strong coupling remains a challenging task.
The main issue is that the usual perturbative series are asymptotic series
which can be useful at weak coupling but break down completely at strong
coupling. In this work, we show that if the limits of integration in the path
integral are finite, the perturbative series is remarkably an absolutely
convergent series which works well at strong coupling. For now, we apply this
perturbative approach to $\lambda \,\phi^4$ theory in 0+0 dimensions (a basic
integral) and 0+1 dimensions (quantum anharmonic oscillator). For the basic
integral, we show that finite integral limits yields a convergent series whose
values are in agreement with exact analytical results at any coupling. This
worked even when the asymptotic series was not Borel summable. It is well known
that the perturbative series expansion in powers of the coupling for the energy
of the anhaorminic oscillator yields an asymptotic series and hence fails at
strong coupling. In quantum mechanics, if one is interested in the energy, it
is often easier to use Schr\"odinger's equation to develop a perturbative
series than path integrals. Finite path integral limits are then equivalent to
placing infinite walls at positions -L and L in the potential where L is
positive, finite and can be arbitrarily large. With walls, the series expansion
for the energy is now convergent and approaches the energy of the anharmonic
oscillator as the walls are moved further apart. We use the convergent series
to calculate the ground state energy at weak, intermediate and strong coupling.
At strong coupling, the result from the series agrees with the exact (correct)
energy to within 0.1 %, a remarkable result in light of the fact that at strong
coupling the usual perturbative series diverges badly right from the start.

Abstract: Accurate energy channel calibration in scintillation detectors is essential
for reliable radiation detection across nuclear physics, medical imaging, and
environmental monitoring. Organic scintillators like BC408 and EJ309 lack
full-energy peaks, making their Compton edge a critical calibration alternative
where traditional peak methods fail. Existing Compton edge identification
techniques - Gaussian fitting for the 50%-70% amplitude point, first derivative
minimum detection, and Monte Carlo simulation - suffer significant degradation
from low count rates, spectral overlap, and subjective interval selection. For
the first time, we propose an automated calibration procedure based on
Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), Simulated Annealing (SA), and a
convolutional response model to address these issues. This method automates the
selection of the Compton edge interval through NCC-based matching, utilizes SA
for global parameter optimization, and then employs a convolutional model for
precise matching. Experiments involving the irradiation of organic
scintillators (BC408, EJ309) and inorganic scintillators (NaI:Tl, LaBr3:Ce)
with 137Cs, 22Na, 54Mn, and 60Co radiation sources demonstrate that this method
achieves accuracy commensurate with full-energy peak calibration method (cosine
similarity >99.999%) and exhibits superior stability compared to the two
traditional methods. In the extreme cases of spectral overlap and low count
rate, the average errors of this method are 19.77% and 15.65% of those from the
two traditional methods in BC408, 56.44% and 33.15% of those from the two
traditional methods in EJ309. This work advances detector calibration and
offers a scalable, automated solution for high-energy experiments and portable
devices.

around the beam pipe. Two stitched sensor evaluation structures, the MOnolithic
Stitched Sensor (MOSS) and MOnolithic Stitched Sensor with Timing (MOST) allow
the study of yield dependence on circuit density, power supply segmentation,
stitching demonstration for power and data transmission, performance dependence
on reverse bias, charge collection performance, parameter uniformity across the
chip, and performance of wafer-scale data transmission.
  The MOST measures 25.9 cm x 0.25 cm, has more than 900,000 pixels of 18x18
$\mu$m$^2$ and emphasizes the validation of pixel circuitry with maximum
density, together with a high number of power domains separated by switches
allowing to disconnect faulty circuits. It employs 1 Gb/s 26 cm long data
transmission using asynchronous, data-driven readout. This readout preserves
information on pixel address, time of arrival and time over threshold. In the
MOSS, by contrast, regions with different in-pixel densities are implemented to
study yield dependence and are read synchronously.
  MOST test results validated the concept of power domain switching and the
data transmission over 26 cm stitched lines which are to be employed on the
full-size, full-functionality ITS3 prototype sensor, MOSAIX. Jitter of this
transmission is still under study. This proceeding summarizes the performance
of the stitched sensor test structures with emphasis on the MOST.

### [29] [Generalized symmetry enriched criticality in (3+1)d](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15925)
*Benjamin Moy*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究者在3+1维连续相变中构造了两类相变，涉及不同广义全局对称性。他们使用SU(N)/ℤₙ规范理论与 Majorana 复场研究，并通过加上时间反转和SO(Nf)对称性，发现了在N偶数和奇Nf充分大的情况，存在量子临界点。该临界点具备增强对称性，包括非可逆的时间反转对称性，这可能为广义对称性的无平方凝聚临界性提供实例。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文探讨广义对称性在物理相变中的应用，结合规范理论和对称群研究，发现量子临界点的表现，这对推动理论物理和量子场论的发展具有重要意义。

Method: 研究者通过构建SU(N)/ℤₙ规范理论与 Majorana 复场的模型，并加入时间反转和SO(Nf)对称性分析相变的性质。通过数学推导和理论模型构建，得出临界点的特性。

Abstract: We construct two classes of continuous phase transitions in 3+1 dimensions
between phases that break distinct generalized global symmetries. Our analysis
focuses on $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of
Majorana fermions in the adjoint representation. For $N$ even and sufficiently
large odd $N_f$, upon imposing time-reversal symmetry and an $SO(N_f)$ flavor
symmetry, the massless theory realizes a quantum critical point between two
gapped phases: one in which a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ one-form symmetry is completely
broken and another where it is broken to $\mathbb{Z}_2$, leading to
$\mathbb{Z}_{N/2}$ topological order. We provide an explicit lattice model that
exhibits this transition. The critical point has an enhanced symmetry, which
includes non-invertible analogues of time-reversal symmetry. Enforcing a
non-invertible time-reversal symmetry and the $SO(N_f)$ flavor symmetry, for
$N$ and $N_f$ both odd, we demonstrate that this critical point can appear
between a topologically ordered phase and a phase that spontaneously breaks the
non-invertible time-reversal symmetry, furnishing an analogue of deconfined
quantum criticality for generalized symmetries.

*Marton K. Lajer,Xin Dai,Kipton Barros,Matthew R. Carbone,S. Johnston,M. P. M. Dean*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper uses Bayesian optimization with EDRIXS to determine Hamiltonian parameters from RIXS spectra. It successfully reproduces results with high precision and offers new parameters for Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenge of extracting Hamiltonian models from experimental RIXS data, which is crucial for understanding quantum materials.

Method: Bayesian optimization combined with EDRIXS to infer parameters from RIXS spectra in the single atom approximation.

Result: The method accurately matches expert analysis, reveals parameter mappings, and introduces new model parameters for specific materials.

Conclusion: The approach advances quantum material modeling and provides new parameters, enhancing predictive capabilities in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Identifying model Hamiltonians is a vital step toward creating predictive
models of materials. Here, we combine Bayesian optimization with the EDRIXS
numerical package to infer Hamiltonian parameters from resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) spectra within the single atom approximation. To evaluate the
efficacy of our method, we test it on experimental RIXS spectra of NiPS3,
NiCl2, Ca3LiOsO6, and Fe2O3, and demonstrate that it can reproduce results
obtained from hand-fitted parameters to a precision similar to expert human
analysis while providing a more systematic mapping of parameter space. Our work
provides a key first step toward solving the inverse scattering problem to
extract effective multi-orbital models from information-dense RIXS
measurements, which can be applied to a host of quantum materials. We also
propose atomic model parameter sets for two materials, Ca3LiOsO6 and Fe2O3,
that were previously missing from the literature.

### [31] [Stoner Transition at Finite Temperature in a 2D Isotropic Fermi Liquid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16026)
*R. David Mayrhofer,Megan Schoenzeit,Andrey V. Chubukov*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper analyzes a mean-field Stoner model in 2D systems with varying dispersion. For α >1, the system shows a reentrant Stoner transition at finite temperatures, where increasing temperature leads to a re-entrant ordered state. This effect occurs more prominently as α increases beyond 1.4. The results suggest that this reentrant behavior is a universal feature in 2D ferromagnetic behaviors. Implications include potential applications in multi-layered systems. More research is needed to confirm and expand these findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems, particularly under varying conditions such as temperature, often reveals unique and unexpected behaviors that are crucial for understanding material properties and potential applications. This paper contributes to the understanding of how temperature affects the Stoner transition, which is significant for the development of materials like graphene and other 2D systems.

Method: Mean-field analysis of the Stoner model in 2D systems with isotropic dispersion εk proportional to k^{2α}. The model considers different values of α to understand how the dispersion affects the transition temperature. Analytical methods are used to derive phase diagrams and identify different types of phase transitions.

Result: The study found that for α >1 in 2D systems, the Stoner transition exhibits reentrant behavior. As temperature increases, the system enters an ordered state again after reaching a certain temperature, indicating a first-order transition. This behavior is observed more significantly for higher α values. The researchers also suggested that this finding is universal and not dependent on the specific details of the electronic structure, which could have implications for the design of new materials with desired magnetic properties.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the reentrant Stoner transition in 2D systems is a fundamental phenomenon that emerges when α exceeds 1.4. This behavior is not sensitive to the specific electronic details of the system but is instead tied to its dimensionality and dispersion characteristics. Understanding this behavior could lead to the development of new materials with tailored magnetic properties under controlled temperature conditions. Future research should focus on verifying these findings in experimental setups, particularly in multi-layer graphene systems, to explore potential applications in electronics and spintronic devices.

Abstract: We present the results of a mean-field analysis of the temperature evolution
of a ferromagnetic Stoner transition in a two-dimensional (2D) system with an
isotropic dispersion $\varepsilon_k \propto k^{2\alpha}$, which for $\alpha >1$
models flat dispersions in various multi-layer graphene systems in a
displacement field. This study is an extension to a finite $T$ of previous
studies at $T=0$, which found both first-order and second-order Stoner
transitions, depending on the value of $\alpha$ and special behavior at $\alpha
=1$ and $\alpha =2$. We find that the Stoner transition at a finite $T$
displays new features not seen at $T=0$. The most interesting one is the
reentrant behavior, where the ordered state emerges as temperature is
increased. This behavior develops at $\alpha >1.4$ and the range where it holds
increases with $\alpha$. We conjecture that the reentrant behavior is the
fundamental feature of the Stoner transition in 2D, not sensitive to the
details of the electronic structure.

### [32] [Unconventional charge density wave in Kagome metal BaFe2Al9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16325)
*Liucheng Chen,Mingwei Ma,Xiaohui Yu,Fang Hong*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses the behavior of the charge density wave (CDW) in the material BaFe2Al9 under high pressure, showing that the CDW transition temperature increases with pressure, and identifies the mechanism as dominated by electron correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the unconventional behavior of a 3D Kagome material under pressure, aiming to understand the CDW mechanism and its implications for exotic electronic states.

Method: The research employs x-ray diffraction methods, both powder and single crystal, to study lattice expansion and diffraction patterns, which helps in characterizing the phase transitions and mechanism of the CDW.

Result: BaFe2Al9 exhibits a pressure-enhanced CDW with TCDW rising to room temperature at high pressure, alongside lattice expansion and splitting diffraction patterns indicating an intrinsic first-order transition.

Conclusion: The material serves as a platform for studying unconventional CDWs and electron-phonon coupling, offering insights into exotic quantum phenomena.

Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by
long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally,
CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are
suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal
BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits
pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises
from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked
by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals
an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The
strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from
single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative
of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response
implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon
correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems.
Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing
electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with
unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides
an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic
electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.

*Sathishkumar M,Asha Ann Abrahama,Rajesh Kumar Sahu,Soma Banik,Soham Manni*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper discusses the effect of fluorine doping on BBO, showing successful synthesis and analyzing structural and electronic properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces BBO as a topological insulator and explores its properties under electron doping with fluorine, which is a promising method for creating superconductors and understanding topological materials.

Method: X-ray photoelectron and diffraction, core level XPS, BSE imaging, and solid-state synthesis.

Result: 10% F-doped BBO confirms electron doping, but 20% leads to multiphase; fluorine doping stabilizes topological insulating state in BBO.

Conclusion: This study contributes to understanding topological insulators and fluorine doping as a potential route towards topological superconductors. It also offers insights into BBO's electronic structure and synthesis methods for topological materials.

Abstract: Topological insulators are a new class of insulators with conducting surface
state. Most of the topological insulators are chalcogenides, where a tiny
amount of chalcogen vacancy destroys the predicted bulk insulating state and
results in a metallic or semimetallic bulk electrical transport. BaBiO$_3$
(BBO) is an interesting large bandgap (0.7 eV) insulator that upon hole doping
becomes a superconductor and is theoretically predicted to show a topological
insulating state under electron doping. We have explored electron doping
through the chemical substitution of fluorine atoms at the oxygen site. The
single crystals of BBO and fluorine doped BBO were synthesized via a one-step
solid-state technique. The single crystals of pure BBO and 10 % F -doped BBO
(BaBiO$_{2.7}$F$_{0.3}$) are chemically single-phase samples and crystallize in
monoclinic I2/m crystal structure. The core level and valence band X-ray
photoelectron spectra confirm electron doping in the 10% fluorine-doped BBO. 20
% F-doped BBO appears to be a multiphase sample, confirmed by back-scattered
electron (BSE) imaging and X-ray diffraction. This article reports on the
successful growth of pure and F-doped BBO using a one-step solid-state
technique and discusses the effect of F-doping on structural and electronic
properties.

Conclusion: 提出了一种有效的替代方案，扩展了自调谐技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission is one of the most established
magneto-optical techniques, particularly well suited for pulsed magnetic
fields. It employs fixed-wavelength monochromatic light as the probe, while the
magnetic field is swept to bring the sample into resonance with the photon
energy. The key component of this setup is a tunable laser system, typically
consisting of a Ti:sapphire laser coupled with an optical parametric
oscillator. However, such laser systems are often bulky, expensive, and
inherently unstable, which significantly limits their widespread application in
magneto-optical laboratories. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy,
cost-effective, and compact tunable monochromatic magneto-transmission system
based on a combination of a laser-driven white light source and a mini
monochromator, and demonstrate its feasibility and performance in a
millisecond-range pulsed magnetic field condition. To verify the accuracy of
this new and simplified setup, we performed Faraday rotation measurements on
the geometrically frustrated spin system CdCr2O4, as well as
magneto-transmission experiments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice
antiferromagnet SrCu2(BO3)2. These results show excellent agreement with
previous reports, confirming the reliability and precision of the new setup.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper presents a significant discovery about excitons in a material called Ta2Pd3Te5, showing that they can emit light directly, indicating their existence. This material might be an excitonic insulator, and the findings could lead to new technologies in optoelectronics and quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of excitons is important because they have potential applications in quantum technologies. This paper adds to that understanding by demonstrating direct observation of exciton properties using advanced spectroscopy techniques.

Method: The researchers observed the excitonic states using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, focusing on the material just below its metal-insulator transition temperature. They analyzed the exciton's energy, size, and parity.

Result: The excitons have lower energy than the valence band maximum, suggesting they can lower the system's energy to help reach the metal-insulator transition. The exciton emission is directly measurable, and they found an unusual odd parity and a specific size, 0.8 times the Bohr radius.

Conclusion: This discovery paves the way for applications in solid-state quantum systems and as a new class of materials for optoelectronics and quantum computing due to their potential to host exotic quantum phases.

Abstract: Excitons are bosonic quasiparticles with a variety of applications in
optoelectronics, photosyn thesis, and dissipationless informatics, and their
lifetime can become sufficiently long to form a quantum condensate. While
exciton condensation has been predicted to occur as a ground state of a solid,
so called an excitonic insulator, whose material realization has been elusive.
Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in
a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta2Pd3Te5 below
its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons
have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase
transition. This measurement further discloses the size and the unusual odd
parity of the exciton wave function. The present finding opens an avenue toward
applications of coherent excitons in solid systems and searching for exotic
quantum phases of exciton condensates.

Conclusion: 研究结果丰富了量子相变理论，并可能为存在于 frustration诱导晶体序中的新相态提供理论依据。

Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of an ``odd'' variant of the
two-dimensional Ising Fradkin--Shenker model, characterized by a uniform
background of static $e$ and $m$ charges. Using large-scale tensor network and
exact diagonalization methods, we determine the topology of the phase diagram,
identifying an ``odd'' deconfined phase, confinement- and Higgs-induced valence
bond solids (VBS), and a trivial paramagnet. Most notably, we uncover an exotic
multicritical point along the self-dual line, where electric and magnetic
excitations are related by an enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2$ duality. This transition
is marked by the simultaneous onset of confinement, Higgs condensation,
translational symmetry breaking, and spontaneous duality symmetry breaking.
Within our numerical accuracy, the transition appears continuous, involving the
softening of excitation gaps for $e$ and $m$ anyons at finite momentum. At
intermediate couplings, we further identify VBS phases with enlarged unit
cells, potentially indicating frustration-induced crystalline order beyond
commensurate limits.

Conclusion: 整体结论是热导率的增强主要受拓扑Majorana费米子的主导贡献，这一理论框架不仅解释了实验结果，还为理解Kitaev材料和跨材料理论与实验连接提供了新途径。

Abstract: We investigate the thermal Hall conductivity in the Kitaev model with
additional interactions under a magnetic field, employing a finite-temperature
tensor network method benchmarked by a thermal pure quantum state technique. We
find that the thermal Hall conductivity divided by temperature,
$\kappa_{xy}/T$, significantly overshoots the value of the half-integer
quantization and exhibits a pronounced hump while decreasing temperature.
Moreover, we show that the field-direction dependence of $\kappa_{xy}/T$ is
consistent with the sign of the Chern number associated with the Majorana
fermions across a wide range of magnetic fields. We also demonstrate that the
additional off-diagonal interactions, known as the $\Gamma$ and
$\Gamma^{\prime}$ terms, considerably affect $\kappa_{xy}/T$. In particular, we
show that positive $\Gamma$ and negative $\Gamma^{\prime}$ lead to a remarkable
enhancement in the intermediate temperature region. From the comparison with
the classical counterpart, we reveal that the effects of the $\Gamma$ term go
beyond the classical picture, indicating significant quantum fluctuation
effects, while those of the $\Gamma^\prime$ term are well captured at the
classical level. These comprehensive analyses indicate that the enhanced
thermal Hall response is consistently explained by dominant contributions from
topological Majorana fermions, even within the polarized regime beyond the
critical field. Our approach not only establishes a robust theoretical
framework for understanding the thermal Hall transport in Kitaev materials such
as $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$, but also offers a promising pathway to bridge the gap
between theories and experiments across a wide range of strongly correlated
materials.

*Sayan Ghosh,Anirudha Menon,Manoranjan Kumar,Rajiv R. P. Singh*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper investigates the phase transitions in TmVO4 under various stimuli, revealing a two-step transition mechanism involving electronic quadrupole and nuclear spin orders, which could be used as a strain-based refrigerant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding phase transitions in rare-earth materials like TmVO4 is important for developing new materials with tunable magnetic and optical properties. This has applications in various fields such as electronics, thermoelectric energy conversion, and quantum information technology.

Method: The authors use a pseudo-spin-1/2 model to understand the interactions—ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller, shear strain, transverse field, and nuclear hyperfine coupling A.

Result: The model predicts electronic quadrupole transition at T_Q and nuclear spin transition at T_N, with a two-step process showing elastocaloric effect when strain is applied, making TmVO4 a potential solid-state refrigerant.

Conclusion: TmVO4 exhibits rich phase behaviors under different stimuli, showing promise for applications in materials with tunable properties based on external fields and strain.

Abstract: Rare-earth material TmVO$_4$ shows ferro-quadrupolar order below a critical
temperature which can be tuned by various parameters such as a magnetic field,
a strain field, chemical composition, and nuclear spin coupling to its
non-Kramers electronic doublets. In this work, we study a pseudo-spin-1/2 model
to understand the various phases in TmVO$_4$. The model captures coupled
electronic and nuclear orders via (i) a ferro-quadrupolar Jahn-Teller
interaction, (ii) a $B_{1g}$ shear strain, (iii) a transverse magnetic field,
and (iv) a weak on-site nuclear hyperfine coupling A. At zero transverse
magnetic and strain fields, electronic quadrupoles undergo a second-order
transition at $T_Q$, lowering the entropy per site from ln 4 to ln 2. At a much
lower $T_N$ ~ $A^2/T_Q$, virtual electronic fluctuations mediate an effective
nuclear-spin Ising interaction, driving a second transition that collapses the
remaining entropy. Under a transverse magnetic field, nuclear moments polarize
smoothly, replacing the sharp low-T transition by a crossover. In contrast,
adiabatic $B_{1g}$ strain sweeps across the two ordering temperatures yielding
a pronounced two-step elastocaloric effect, highlighting TmVO$_4$ as a tunable
strain-driven solid-state refrigerant.

Abstract: Conductivity is one of the most direct probes of electronic systems, yet its
theoretical description remains challenging in the presence of strong non-local
correlations. In this Letter, we analyze the conductivity of the half-filled
single-band Hubbard model and identify the role of spatial correlations across
the Mott transition. We show that in the correlated metallic regime, an
accurate description of the conductivity requires not only the correct spectral
function but also the inclusion of complex multi-electron processes encoded in
vertex corrections. The crossover to the Mott insulating regime is marked by a
vanishing contribution of vertex corrections to the DC conductivity. However,
in the Mott insulating case, vertex corrections remain significant for the
optical conductivity.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的几何约束方法。传统的周etal(2015)方法在拓扑和自由形式优化中用于设定最小长度尺度，但随着设计二元化增加，其效果变差且需要大量参数调 tune。该论文从基础原理推导出解析性参数，并对圆锥和PDE滤波方案进行了分析，发现PDE方案受Green函数奇异性影响，不够稳健。为此，引入双重滤波方法，结合新推导的参数，使几何约束变得更简单，调节参数更少。HAMmondetal(2025)的亚像素平滑投影方法帮助加快了二元优化收敛。该方法在光子ics和传热反 Design问题中表现有效。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更有效和简洁的几何约束方法，在减少参数调谐需求的同时，提升了优化效率和设计质量。特别是双重滤波技术的有效性和HAMmond等人的平滑投影方法，为解决复杂优化问题提供了新的思路。未来，这些方法可以在光子ics和传热优化等领域进一步应用和开发。

Abstract: The geometric constraints of Zhou et al. (2015) are a widely used technique
in topology/freeform optimization to impose minimum lengthscales for
manufacturability. However, its efficacy degrades as design binarization is
increased, and it requires heuristic tuning of multiple hyperparameters. In
this work, we derive analytical hyperparameters from first principles,
depending only on the target lengthscale. We present results for both conic and
PDE-based filtering schemes, showing that the latter is less robust due to the
singularity of its underlying Green's function. To address this, we also
introduce a double-filtering approach to obtain a well-behaved PDE-based
filter. Combined with our derived hyperparameters, we obtain a straightforward
strategy for enforcing lengthscales using geometric constraints, with minimal
hyperparameter tuning. A key enabling factor is the recent subpixel-smooth
projection (SSP) method (Hammond et al. 2025), which facilitates the
rapidly-converging optimization of almost-everywhere binary designs. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated for several photonics and

Abstract: We investigate the saturable absorption behavior of a 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer
integrated with a silicon nitride waveguide for applications in photonic neural
networks. Using experimental transmission measurements and theoretical
modeling, we characterize the nonlinear response of the material. Our model,
incorporating quasi-Fermi level separation and carrier dynamics, successfully
explains these behaviors and predicts the material's absorption dependence on
the carrier density. Furthermore, we demonstrate a coupling efficiency of up to
20% between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer and the silicon nitride waveguide, with
saturation achievable at input powers as low as a few uW. These results suggest
that 1T'-MoTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for implementing nonlinear functions

Abstract: Broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy plays a
vital role in chemical sensing and label-free vibrational imaging, yet
conventional methods suffer from limited acquisition speeds and complex
detection schemes. Here, we demonstrate high-speed broadband CARS enabled by
nonlinear spectral ghost imaging combined with time-stretch dispersive
Fourier-transform spectroscopy (TS-DFT). We exploit modulation instability to
generate a stochastic supercontinuum as the Stokes source and a synchronized
narrowband pulse as the pump. Reference Stokes spectra are captured at 60.5 MHz
via TS-DFT, while anti-Stokes signals are detected using a single
non-spectrally resolving photodetector. Correlating these signals enables
broadband CARS spectral reconstruction across the fingerprint (600-1600 cm-1)
and C-H stretching (2600-3400 cm-1) regions with 13 cm-1 resolution and
microsecond-scale acquisition times. Our method enables robust signal recovery
without the need for spectral resolution in the detection path, facilitating
measurements in complex biological and chemical environments.

Abstract: Infrared-triggered photon upconversion in porous materials presents
intriguing prospects for combined functionalities such as molecular sponge,
energy harvesting and conversion functionalities. Metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) are one of the most versatile classes of porous crystals. So far only
two-photon upconverting processes have been realized in MOFs both by ligand
based triplet-triplet annihilation and directly in lanthanide ions. Here we
report on Yb3+/Er3+-trimesate-based MOFs that exhibit photon avalanche (PA)
characteristics. The PA process conventionally occurs through cross-relaxation
within the lanthanide emitter manifold. In contrast, here PA proceeds in the
organic molecule part and relies on a cooperative process, involving multiple
emission centers. The IR photons are first absorbed and upconverted into high
energy electronic population by the action of the lanthanide ions (Yb3+ and
Er3+ are the sensitizer and the activator, respectively). Subsequently, the
electrons are funneled into electronically coupled triplet states of the
trimesate ligand, enabling accumulation in the organic matrix. This reservoir
acts as source for a highly nonlinear spectrally broadband emission, arising
mainly from ligand triplet states. The nonlinearity factor is comparable with
the well-established PA inorganic nanoparticles. We prove that the PA is
strongly related to the degree of crystallinity of the MOF: not well-formed
frameworks support only the characteristic Er3+ emission with only linear
increase as a function of the excitation power. Our work paves a path towards
vastly expanding the range of materials exhibiting PA, well beyond a limited
set of lanthanide ions. Moreover, it provides a path for much broader control
of the PA emission characteristics.

Motivation: The motivation stems from the need for better understanding and controlling coherent phenomena in strong-field interactions, which is crucial for various scientific and technological applications.

Method: The paper describes a design addressing the issues with AOMs in NIR laser pulses, focusing on temporal and angular dispersion, self-phase modulation, and efficiency.

Result: The proposed interferometer design solves these issues, enabling more efficient and selective measurement of nonlinear responses, useful for phase-modulation interferometry applications.

Conclusion: The interferometer design offers a promising solution, facilitating the investigation of strong-field processes and improving interferometry in other applications.

Abstract: The investigation of coherent phenomena in strong-field processes requires
interferometric measurement schemes with high selectivity to disentangle the
complex nonlinear response of the system. Interferometers combining
acousto-optical phase modulation with lock-in detection feature excellent
dynamic range and highly selective detection, thus providing a promising
solution. However, acousto-optical modulators (AOMs) cause several issues when
operated with intense, ultrashort, near infrared (NIR) laser pulses. The AOMs
introduce temporal and angular dispersion, self-phase modulation and reduced
acousto-optic efficiency at NIR wavelengths. Here, we present an
acousto-optical phase modulation interferometer design that solves these
issues. The presented solutions pave the way for the investigation of
strong-field processes with phasemodulated interferometry and are also useful
to improve the performance of phase-modulation interferometers in other
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to achieve both atomic spatial and temporal resolution in STM using near-IR frequencies, pushing temporal resolution towards the attosecond range. They target sub-cycle tunnelling currents for this goal.

Method: They use near-infrared single-cycle pulses and a modulation scheme to suppress thermal effects and isolate carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-dependent photocurrents, enabling coherent current detection.

Result: The method successfully generates and detects the desired currents, achieving high sensitivity and suppression of artifacts.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new possibilities for high-resolution imaging and real-time nanoscale control using STM combined with ultrafast optics.

Abstract: Lightwave-driven scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) at near-IR frequencies
promises an unprecedented combination of atomic spatial resolution and temporal
resolution approaching the attosecond range. To achieve this goal,
high-sensitivity optical control and detection of sub-cycle tunnelling currents
must be achieved at the STM junction. Here, we demonstrate the generation and
detection of coherent ultrafast currents across the junction of an STM
illuminated by near-infrared single-cycle pulses. We introduce a novel
modulation scheme that avoids time-dependent thermal loading while selectively
isolating carrier-envelope phase (CEP)-dependent photocurrents. All artifacts
arising from periodic modulation of laser power and thermal coupling are
efficiently suppressed, enabling a clean readout of the coherent portion of the
ultrafast tunneling current.

Conclusion: 该研究成功设计出一种同时具备广域宽频和高效率的金属透镜，为 president imaging和光 steer应用提供了新方案。

Abstract: Achieving simultaneous broadband achromatic focusing and a wide field of view
remains a significant challenge for metalenses. In this work, we begin with a
quadratic phase profile, enabling full field-of-view designs, and apply
dispersion engineering to minimize variations of the focal length across
wavelengths, thereby substantially reducing both longitudinal and transverse
chromatic aberrations. This is accomplished using only the propagation phase in
waveguide-like rectangular meta-atoms, without relying on geometric phase
contributions. The fabricated singlet metalens experimentally demonstrates a
field of view of 86{\textdegree}, along with a tenfold reduction in focal
length variations with wavelength compared to a conventional quadratic
metalens, achieving a measured relative shift as low as 1.3% across the 1.5
$\mu$m - 1.6 $\mu$m range (limited by our experimental setup). This improvement
also leads to a twofold increase in focusing efficiency relative to the
reference metalens. These experimental results validate the effectiveness of
our design strategy in simultaneously enhancing the operational bandwidth and
field of view of metalenses. The demonstrated performance can directly benefit
beam steering applications in the near-infrared wavelength range and provides a
path toward achromatic, wide field-of-view metalenses in the visible range for
imaging systems

TL;DR: The paper discusses a challenge in characterizing a commercial Fabry-Perot laser diode with extreme dimensions and rough mirrors, leading to difficulties in numerical modeling. They use numerical methods to study how roughness affects spectral properties, with applications in photonic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses technical challenges in modeling optical systems with extreme dimension variations, necessitating the development of effective numerical methods.

Method: Numerical simulation of cavity modes is used to analyze the impact of random mirror roughness on spectral features, focusing on applications in photonic devices.

Result: The simulations provide insights into how roughness affects spectral properties, aiding in the development of efficient photonic devices.

Conclusion: The study contributes a methodological approach to model high-dimensional optical systems, particularly useful for advancing photonic technology applications.

Abstract: A commercial Fabry-Perot laser diode is characterized by highly
disproportionate dimensions, which poses a significant numerical challenge,
even for state-of-the-art tools. This challenge is exacerbated when one of the
cavity mirrors is rough-ened, as is the case when fabricating random laser
diodes. Such a system involves length scales from several hundred mi-crometres
(length) to a few nanometres (roughness) all of which are relevant when
studying optical properties in the visi-ble. While involving an extreme range
of dimensions, these cavities cannot be treated through statistical approaches
such as those used with self-similar fractal structures known to show
well-studied properties. Here we deploy numerical meth-ods to compute cavity
modes and show how random corrugations of the Fabry-Perot cavity wall affect
statistical proper-ties of their spectral features. Our study constitutes a
necessary first step in developing technologically essential devices for
photonic computation and efficient speckle-free illumination.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of miniaturized imaging with super-resolution capabilities is a significant advancement, especially for label-free screening applications.

Method: They used tunable spatial frequency shift (SFS) via propagating and evanescent waves, encoded LED arrays for multi-illumination modes, and miniaturized prisms for efficient imaging. Integrated LED arrays replaced expensive lasers, enhancing compactness and cost-efficiency.

Result: Achieved remarkable 333 nm resolution (close to theoretical limit) with ~1mm² FOV, successfully imaged USAF, Star, and onion samples without labels, and cost-effective for various microscopy uses.

Conclusion: The mini-FEI offers a scalable, low-cost solution for high-throughput super-resolution imaging suitable for broad scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: A miniaturized full-frequency encoded illumination (mini-FEI) chip is
presented for high-throughput super-resolution imaging using the spatial
frequency shift (SFS) effect. A tunable full SFS scheme is achieved through
propagating and evanescent wave. The multi-illumination modes are precisely and
flexibly modulated by an encoded LED array. The light travels to the sample via
a set of prisms, producing the super-resolution images with high
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Mini-FEI super-resolution imaging reaches a
resolution of 333 nm (~{\lambda}/4NA), close to the theoretical limit, while
maintaining a large field of view (FOV) of ~1 mm2. The method is validated on
label-free samples including USAF Target, Star Target, and onion root tip
cells, all of which could be successfully reconstructed. Through the
introduction of integrated LED arrays for evanescent wave excitation, expensive
laser systems can be avoided and the system significantly miniaturized. The
mini-FEI super-resolution imaging chip is simple and cost effective to
fabricate and can be used in conjunction with any inverted brightfield
microscope frame and thus has great potential for widespread use in scientific
and industrial research environments.

Motivation: The paper aims to explore the topology of nonparaxial monochromatic light beyond conventional paraxial approximations, focusing on how electric and magnetic fields interact and break fundamental symmetries.<br><br>Understanding these topological aspects can provide new insights into the behavior of light in structured beams and its applications in optical manipulation and quantum technologies.

Method: The authors introduce a novel geometric construct called the EM ellipse in electric-magnetic space. This tool is used to visualize and analyze the topological properties of light, including singularities and polarization structures, which emerge even in simple structured wave forms like focused linearly polarized vortex beams.

Result: The EM ellipse successfully captures the topology of nonparaxial light, revealing circular and linear polarization singularities and organizing them into particle-like textures. This structure is found even in rudimentary light forms such as focused linearly polarized vortex beams, suggesting its universality across different light configurations.

Conclusion: This research provides a significant advancement in understanding the topology of nonparaxial light, offering a new framework to analyze and potentially control light's topological properties, which could enhance applications in optical manipulation, quantum information processing, and advanced imaging technologies.

Abstract: In nonparaxial, monochromatic light the electric and magnetic fields
generally have different energy densities, different singularities and
different polarisation structures. A topological picture of the electric field
or magnetic field in isolation cannot capture the elusive topology of
nonparaxial light that exists in the spatially dependent relationship between
the two fields: the degree to which light breaks fundamental symmetries
(parity, duality, time-reversal). With this work a new ellipse is introduced
that resides not in real space, but in electric-magnetic (EM) space, and whose
geometry depends on these broken symmetries. The EM ellipse has circular and
linear polarisation singularities and may be organised into particle-like
textures. These thus-far hidden topologies are present even in rudimentary
structured waves, for a second-order EM-space meron is shown to be present in a
focussed linearly polarised vortex beam.

Abstract: Cells control their size to cope with noise during growth and division.
Eukaryotic cells exhibiting "sizer" control (targeting a specific size before
dividing) are thought to rely on molecular concentration thresholds, but simple
implementations of this strategy are not stable. We derive a general criterion
for concentration-based sizer control and demonstrate it with a mechanistic
model that resolves the instability by using multistage progression towards
division. We show that if at least one stage has concentration dynamics that
are a pure function of size, then sizer control follows for the whole
progression. We predict that perturbations to the dynamics shift the size
statistics without disrupting sizer control, consistent with recent experiments
on fission yeast.

Result: 研究发现，通过对Janus态的处理，可以完全消除高阶光统计现象（g^{(k)}=0，当k≥3）。这显示出量子互补性在高阶统计中的极端表现，同时利用Wigner函数的负性验证了非经典性。

Conclusion: Janus态展示了量子互补性的潜在应用，特别是在通过可得信息调控多光子相关性方面。这为开发精确调控非经典光的量子工程方法提供了理论基础。未来研究可能扩展到更多量子系统，甚至有机化合物的光子相互作用，以实现复杂的量子控制机制。

Abstract: We report a profound manifestation of quantum complementarity in the
higher-order photon statistics of the ``Janus state,'' a coherent superposition
of two squeezed vacua. We find that the state acts as a perfect quantum switch
for multi-photon correlations, toggled by the availability of which-path
information. Erasing this information activates quantum interference that can
be tuned to be maximally destructive. This reveals a remarkable hierarchy of
suppression: while two-photon correlations remain finite, we prove analytically
and demonstrate numerically that it is possible to drive all higher-order
correlations ($g^{(k)}$ for $k \ge 3$) to zero. This transition from the
extreme bunching of the constituent states ($g^{(k)} \to \infty$) to a state of
profound quantum order is visualized by the emergence of negativity in the
state's Wigner function, an unambiguous signature of non-classicality. This
work provides a foundational demonstration of quantum complementarity in
multi-photon statistics and introduces a new paradigm for engineering highly
ordered, non-classical light from Gaussian resources.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper explores how quantum thermodynamic quantities are affected by experimental precision, showing that while the relations between these quantities remain consistent regardless of the instrument used, the specific values can vary significantly depending on the precision of the experiment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper delves into the implications of limited experimental precision on the measurement of thermodynamic quantities in quantum systems, challenging the traditional assumption of objectivity in such measurements.

Method: The authors likely used theoretical analysis and possibly numerical simulations or calculations to estimate the impact of precision limits on thermodynamic definitions.

Result: The study found that while the fundamental relationships (like the second law inequality) between thermodynamic quantities hold true across different precisions, the actual values of these quantities (e.g., irreversibility, work payoff) can vary drastically depending on the measurement precision.

Conclusion: This work underscores that while observations are crucial, the underlying thermodynamic relations are independent of the experimental instrument's precision, supporting the objectivity of thermodynamic foundational concepts despite practical measurement limitations.

Abstract: In both classical and quantum thermodynamics, physical quantities are
typically assigned objective values defined independently of our observations.
We then refer to the 'work performed by a gas', or the 'entropy of the gas',
regardless of how they are evaluated. Here, we question this conception in the
context of quantum thermodynamics, estimating how the definition of pivotal
thermodynamic quantities is affected by experimental instruments of limited
precision. We find that the coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities frequently
lead to different conclusions from those drawn in fine-grained scenarios. For
instance, the irreversibility of a process, or its work payoff, can
significantly vary with the instrument precision. We show nonetheless that
coarse-grained thermodynamic quantities satisfy the same relations (i.e., the
second law inequality, the relation between dissipation and distinguishability
of a process from its time-reverse, and the quantum work fluctuation theorems)
as their fine-grained counterparts. These results highlight the
observation-independence of relations linking thermodynamic quantities which
are themselves observation-dependent.

Conclusion:  该研究揭示了高内斯金数量子平台在量子 metrology 中的优势，为量子信息处理和量子计算提供了新的思路和可能性。

Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a measure quantifying the sensitivity of
a quantum state with respect to changes in tuning parameters in quantum
metrology, and defining quantum speed limits. We show that even if the quantum
state is completely dispersionless, QFI in this state remains
momentum-resolved. We compute the QFI for topological phases at integer filling
and demonstrate that each momentum-resolved term is fundamentally bounded by
quantum geometric and topological invariants, with maximum QFI controlled by
topological invariants (Chern number $|C|$). We also finds bounds on quantum
speed limit which scales as $\sqrt{|C|}$ in a (dispersionless) topological
phase. We conclude that quantum platforms of high Chern numbers $|C| \gg 1$,
such as those featuring twisted multilayered van der Waals heterostructures,
significantly enhance capacity for quantum Fisher information, and provide
practical control over quantum speed limits.

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special points in non-Hermitian systems where
both eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce. In open quantum systems, these
points are typically analyzed using effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or
Liouvillian superoperators. While quantum channels offer the most general
framework for describing state evolution in such systems, the existence and
properties of EPs within this setting remain largely unexplored. In this work,
we present a general strategy for generating quantum EPs for a single-qubit
setting. We show that quantum channels can be separated into two distinct
phases, with the transition between them marked by the presence of an EP. Based
on this, we propose a systematic method to realize EPs by interpolating between
quantum channels representing different phases. Experimentally, we implement
these interpolated channels on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum
computer and confirm the emergence of second-order EPs with high fidelity.
Extending the interpolation to three channels further reveals third-order EPs.
Our results establish quantum channel interpolation as a versatile framework
for generating EPs and provide a general description of EPs in open quantum
systems.

Abstract: We present the first detailed simulation of a measurement based quantum
computation based on Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits within a quad-rail
lattice (QRL) cluster state involving over 100 GKP modes. This was enabled by
the recently developed functional matrix product states (FMPS) framework, with
which we simulate continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits while explicitly
modelling intrinsic coherent error sources due to finite squeezing. We perform
simulated randomised benchmarking across squeezing levels between 5 and 15 dB
and find strong agreement with analytical estimates for high quality GKP
qubits. As a demonstration of practical computation, we simulate a three-qubit
Grover's algorithm within the QRL and identify a fundamental squeezing
threshold -- approximately 10 dB -- beyond which the algorithm outperforms
classical probability bounds.

Abstract: Interfacing superconducting microwave resonators with optical systems enables
sensitive photon detectors, quantum transducers, and related quantum
technologies. Achieving high optical pulse repetition is crucial for maximizing
the device throughput. However, light-induced deterioration, such as
quasiparticle poisoning, pair-breaking-phonon generation, and elevated
temperature, hinders the rapid recovery of superconducting circuits, limiting
their ability to sustain high optical pulse repetition rates. Understanding
these loss mechanisms and enabling fast circuit recovery are therefore
critical. In this work, we investigate the impact of optical illumination on
niobium nitride and niobium microwave resonators by immersing them in
superfluid helium-4 and demonstrate a three-order-of-magnitude faster resonance
recovery compared to vacuum. By analyzing transient resonance responses, we
provide insights into light-induced dynamics in these superconductors,
highlighting the advantages of niobium-based superconductors and superfluid
helium for rapid circuit recovery in superconducting quantum systems integrated
with optical fields.

*Sangwon Kim,Seongjin Ahn,Denis V. Seletskiy,Andrey S. Moskalenko*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework for quantum light tunneling using a hydrodynamic approach based on Bohmian trajectories to explain electron transport, showing agreement with experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation seems to be exploring the theoretical understanding of quantum light tunneling and its implications for electron transport, particularly in tunneling microscopes.

Method: The authors use a hydrodynamic formulation of light coupled with Bohmian mechanics to model the tunneling process and analyze electron transport in tunneling microscopes.

Result: The framework effectively models the quantum tunneling behavior of electrons, demonstrating compatibility with experimental evidence.

Conclusion: The proposed theoretical model successfully integrates quantum light statistics into the explanation of electron tunneling, offering a coherent framework for understanding such phenomena in quantum systems.

Abstract: Recent realization of an intense quantum light, namely bright squeezed
vacuum, opened a new perspective on quantum light-matter interaction. Several
theoretical works have appeared based on coherent state expansions of quantum
state of light to investigate non-classical driving of high-harmonic generation
in atomic gases and solids, or free-electron dynamics, but their predictions
surprisingly coincide with what one could expect from essentially classical
interpretations of the light statistics. A deeper theoretical insight into the
underlying physics is necessary for understanding of observed experimental
findings and predicting emerging effects relying on this new configuration.
Here we present a theoretical framework to describe tunneling driven by quantum
light, where the properties of such light are captured by a statistical
ensemble of classical fields via a hydrodynamic, also referred to as Bohmian,
formulation. Generalizing the quasiclassical theory of non-adiabatic tunneling
driven by classical light, a single tunneling event is described by a bundle of
tunneling solutions, each driven by a classical field corresponding to one
realization in the ensemble. Quantum statistics of light are thus imprinted on
the measured current. Fully quantum description of light via the Bohmian
trajectories of its field provides a perfect fit to the description of the
electron (under-) above-barrier dynamics in terms of (complex quasiclassical)
real classical trajectories, resulting in a consistent and elegant theoretical
approach. To illustrate this, we consider BSV-induced electron transport from
the tip to the surface in the tunneling microscope configuration demonstrating
the transition from the multiphoton to the direct tunneling regime.

Abstract: Quantum random walks represent a powerful tool for the implementation of
various quantum algorithms. We consider a convolution problem for the graphs
which provide quantum and classical random walks. We suggest a new method for
lattices and hypercycle convolution that preserves quantum walk dynamics. Our
method is based on the fact that some graphs represent a result of Kronecker's
product of line graphs. We support our methods by means of various numerical
experiments that check quantum and classical random walks on hypercycles and
their convolutions. Our findings may be useful for saving a significant number
of qubits required for algorithms that use quantum walk simulation on quantum

Abstract: Engineering quantum bath networks through non-Hermitian subsystem
Hamiltonians has recently emerged as a promising strategy for qubit cooling,
state stabilization, and fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, scaling
these systems while maintaining precise control over their complex
interconnections, especially in the optical domain, poses significant
challenges in both theoretical modeling and physical implementation. In this
work, drawing on principles from quantum and mathematical physics, we introduce
a systematic framework for constructing non-Hermitian subsystems within
entirely Hermitian photonic platforms. In particular, controlled exponential
decay without actual absorption loss is realized in finite 1-D waveguide chains
through discrete-to-continuum coupling and Lanczos transformations. Using this
new methodology, we implement parity-time symmetric quantum systems and
experimentally demonstrate that these artificial bath environments accurately
replicate the dynamics of non-Hermitian arrangements in both single- and
multi-photon excitation regimes. Since the non-Hermitian subsystem response
deterministically arises from an artificially built Hermitian bath, the quantum
evolution can be monitored via post-selection in this fully conservative
configuration. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical models and
experimental realizations, thus paving the way for exploiting quantum bath
engineering in advanced information processing and emerging quantum
technologies.

Abstract: A system-independent intermediate representation (IR) for pulse-level
programming of quantum control systems is required to enable rapid development
and reuse of quantum software across diverse platforms. In this work, we
demonstrate the utility of pulselib as a candidate for such an IR. We implement
graph-based IRs and transpilation pipelines for two unique frequency
synthesizers and benchmark performance against existing IRs. Key elements of
these pipelines are munchers and parametrizable pulse schedules. The former
encodes target-specific constraints and allows translation of fundamentally
system-agnostic pulse descriptions to arbitrary low-level representations, and
the latter enables schedule reuse that produces savings in transpilation time
relative to device-specific alternatives. Benchmarks reveal that pulselib
provides performance comparable to fast, device-specific IRs while providing a
speedup of up to 4.5x over existing IRs. For highly parametrized applications,
pulselib provides favorable scaling of transpilation times with respect to the
number of parameters and can exhibit speedups relative to existing IRs up to
69% larger than speedups provided by optimized, device-specific techniques.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are among the most promising approaches
for leveraging near-term quantum hardware, yet their effectiveness strongly
depends on the design of the underlying circuit ansatz, which is typically
constructed with heuristic methods. In this work, we represent the synthesis of
variational quantum circuits as a sequential decision-making problem, where
gates are added iteratively in order to optimize an objective function, and we
introduce two reinforcement learning-based methods, RLVQC Global and RLVQC
Block, tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. RLVQC Block creates
ansatzes that generalize the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA),
by discovering a two-qubits block that is applied to all the interacting qubit
pairs. While RLVQC Global further generalizes the ansatz and adds gates
unconstrained by the structure of the interacting qubits. Both methods adopt
the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and use empirical measurement
outcomes as state observations to guide the agent. We evaluate the proposed
methods on a broad set of QUBO instances derived from classical graph-based
optimization problems. Our results show that both RLVQC methods exhibit strong
results with RLVQC Block consistently outperforming QAOA and generally
surpassing RLVQC Global. While RLVQC Block produces circuits with depth
comparable to QAOA, the Global variant is instead able to find significantly
shorter ones. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning methods can be
an effective tool to discover new ansatz structures tailored for specific
problems and that the most effective circuit design strategy lies between rigid
predefined architectures and completely unconstrained ones, offering a
favourable trade-off between structure and adaptability.

Abstract: Quantum Annealing (QA) is a quantum computing paradigm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. An essential step in QA is minor
embedding, which maps the problem graph onto the sparse topology of the quantum
processor. This process is computationally expensive and scales poorly with
increasing problem size and hardware complexity. Existing heuristics are often
developed for specific problem graphs or hardware topologies and are difficult
to generalize. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by
treating minor embedding as a sequential decision-making problem, where an
agent learns to construct minor embeddings by iteratively mapping the problem
variables to the hardware qubits. We propose a RL-based approach to minor
embedding using a Proximal Policy Optimization agent, testing its ability to
embed both fully connected and randomly generated problem graphs on two
hardware topologies, Chimera and Zephyr. The results show that our agent
consistently produces valid minor embeddings, with reasonably efficient number
of qubits, in particular on the more modern Zephyr topology. Our proposed
approach is also able to scale to moderate problem sizes and adapts well to
different graph structures, highlighting RL's potential as a flexible and
general-purpose framework for minor embedding in QA.

TL;DR: This paper presents a new polarization encoder for single-photon qubits using a Sagnac interferometer, which achieves a low quantum bit error rate of 0.69% at a high repetition rate of 152 MHz, offering improved stability and performance over previous setups with phase modulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the challenge of achieving high-speed, low-error single-photon encoding for quantum applications, which is crucial for quantum communication and computation.

Method: The method involves using a Sagnac interferometer to encode polarization information onto single photons, modulated at 152 MHz, ensuring high repetition rates for efficient information processing.

Result: The key results include a significantly reduced quantum bit error rate compared to existing systems, demonstrating robust and scalable single photon encoding capability.

Conclusion: This advancement contributes to overcoming the limitations of previous photon encoding methods, offering a more reliable platform for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: The ability to inscribe information on single photons at high speeds is a
crucial requirement for quantum applications such as quantum communication and
measurement-based photonic quantum computation. Nowadays, most experimental
implementations employ phase modulators in single-pass, Mach-Zehnder
interferometer or Michelson interferometer configurations to encode information
on photonic qubits. However, these approaches are intrinsically sensitive to
environmental influences, limiting the achievable quantum error rates in
practice. We report on the first demonstration of a polarization encoder for
single-photon qubits based on a free-space Sagnac interferometer, showcasing
inherent phase stability and overcoming previous error rate limitations.
Telecom-wavelength single photons emitted by a quantum dot are modulated by the
encoder under a repetition rate of 152 MHz. A quantum bit error rate of
0.69(2)% is achieved, marking the lowest error rate reported to date for
high-speed information encoding on single photons. This work represents a key
advance towards robust, scalable, and low-error quantum information processing
with single photon sources.

Abstract: In this work, we consider the feasibility of Schr{\"o}dinger cat (SC) and
$N00N$ states formation by a convenient bosonic Josephson junction (BJJ) system
in two-mode approximation. Starting with purely quantum description of two-mode
Bose-Einstein condensate we investigate the effective potential approach that
provides an accurate analytical description for the system with a large number
of particles. We show that in the zero temperature limit SC states result from
a quantum phase transition that occurs when the nonlinear strength becomes
comparable with the Josephson coupling parameter. The Wigner function approach
demonstrates the growth of the SC state halves separation and formation of
$N00N$-like states (a Fock state superposition) with the particle number
increase. We examine the possibility to attain the SC state at finite
temperatures and a weak dissipation leading to appearing of some critical
temperature; it defines the second-order phase transition from classical
activation process to the SC state formation through the quantum tunneling
phenomenon. Numerical estimations demonstrate that the critical temperature is
sufficiently below the temperature of atomic condensation. The results obtained
may be useful for experimental observation of SC states with small condensate
Josephson junctions.

Abstract: Chiral coupling opens new avenues for controlling and exploiting light-matter
interactions. We demonstrate that chiral coupling can be utilized to achieve
unidirectional perfect absorption. In our experiments, chiral magnon-photon
coupling is realized by coupling the magnon modes in yttrium iron garnet (YIG)
spheres with spin-momentum-locked waveguide modes supported by spoof surface
plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). These photon modes exhibit transverse spin, with
the spin direction determined by the propagation direction. Due to the
intrinsic spin properties of the magnon mode, it exclusively couples with
microwaves traveling in one direction, effectively suppressing the reflection
channel. Under the critical coupling condition, transmission is also
eliminated, resulting in unidirectional perfect absorption. By incorporating
additional YIG spheres, bidirectional and multi-frequency perfect absorption
can be achieved. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring and
harnessing chiral light-matter interactions within spin-momentum locked
devices, offering a paradigm for unidirectional signal processing and energy
harvesting technologies.

Abstract: Quantum computers face inherent scaling challenges, a fact that necessitates
investigation of distributed quantum computing systems, whereby scaling is
achieved through interconnection of smaller quantum processing units. However,
connecting large numbers of QPUs will eventually result in connectivity
constraints at the network level, where the difficulty of entanglement sharing
increases with network path lengths. This increases the complexity of the
quantum circuit partitioning problem, since the cost of generating entanglement
between end nodes varies with network topologies and existing links. We address
this challenge using a simple modification to existing partitioning schemes
designed for all-to-all connected networks, that efficiently accounts for both
of these factors. We investigate the performance in terms of entanglement
requirements and optimisation time of various quantum circuits over different
network topologies, achieving lower entanglement costs in the majority of cases
than state-of-the-art methods. We provide techniques for scaling to large-scale
quantum networks employing both network and problem coarsening. We show that
coarsened methods can achieve improved solution quality in most cases with
significantly lower run-times than direct partitioning methods.

*Xing M. Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Einstein’s delayed-choice experiment recreated with single electrons and hemispherical detectors to compare MWI and BHSI theories, suggesting local branching is sufficient without global splitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand real-world implications of quantum interpretations, particularly delayed-choice experiments in branching theories.

Method: Recreating the 1927 Einstein thought experiment using modern technology, comparing MWI and BHSI with single-electron and hemispherical detectors, analyzing detector statistics for branching outcomes.

Result: Statistical evidence supports local branching without global collapse or parallel worlds.

Conclusion: Local, unitary branching via MWI or BHSI better explains results than global splitting or wavefunction collapse.

Abstract: We revisit the 1927 thought experiment of Einstein on electron diffraction,
using a single-electron source and an opaque hemispheric detector array, now
achievable with modern sensors. In this fully enclosed system, where no signals
escape the hemisphere, we provide a direct empirical comparison of the
Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) and the Branched Hilbert Subspace
Interpretation (BHSI). Both maintain unitarity without invoking wavefunction
collapse, as in the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), but differ ontologically:
MWI proposes irreversible global branching into parallel worlds, while BHSI
describes local, potentially reversible branching into decohered subspaces. In
this setup, all quantum events (branching, engagement, disengagement, and
relocation) occur entirely within the local system, and the Born rule,
naturally emerging through branch weights, can be observed in detector
statistics. To explore branching dynamics more thoroughly, we suggest an
enhanced dual-layer experimental setup with an inner transparent detector.
Because the electron transit time between layers is shorter than the average
response times of the inner sensors, this allows for a crucial test of
measurement timing and potential anomalies, such as delayed or uncommitted
choices. Our analysis challenges the notion that unitarity necessitates
parallel worlds, instead advocating for a simpler view: local, unitary
branching without collapse or global splitting.

Conclusion: 该研究为多通道Zeno大陆提供了理论基础，并指导了量子算法的设计。

Abstract: Quantum Zeno dragging enables the preparation of common eigenstates of a set
of observables by frequent measurement and adiabatic-like modulation of the
measurement basis. In this work, we present a deeper analysis of multi-channel
Zeno dragging using generalized measurements, i.e. simultaneously measuring a
set of non-commuting observables that vary slowly in time, to drag the state
towards a target subspace. For concreteness, we will focus on a
measurement-driven approach to solving k-SAT problems as examples. We first
compute some analytical upper bounds on the convergence time, including the
effect of finite measurement time resolution. We then apply optimal control
theory to obtain the optimal dragging schedule that lower bounds the
convergence time, for low-dimensional settings. This study provides a
theoretical foundation for multi-channel Zeno dragging and its optimization,
and also serves as a guide for designing optimal dragging schedules for quantum
information tasks including measurement-driven quantum algorithms.

### [71] [On two-dimensional tensor network group symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16475)
*José Garre-Rubio,András Molnár*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  This paper introduces a method using two-dimensional tensor networks with finite group cocycles to construct gapped phases in (2+1)D and symmetric states in (3+1)D, emphasizing unified frameworks and explicit tensor equations. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  The author is likely expanding on tensor network methods, possibly for quantum phases of matter or topological phases, aiming to unify existing approaches and provide a clearer framework. 

Method:  The paper uses two-dimensional tensor networks with cohomology classes of finite groups, specifically 4-cocycles, to model anomalous symmetries and derive gapped phases in (2+1)D and higher-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases. They also develop tensor network unitaries to generate these states, addressing consistency conditions explicitly. 

Result:  The authors successfully unify and generalize the construction of certain gapped phases and higher-dimensional topological phases within a single tensor network framework, using explicit local tensor equations. This could lead to better understanding of quantum phases with global symmetries. 

Conclusion:  The paper provides a comprehensive framework for constructing and understanding gapped (2+1)D phases and (3+1)D symmetry-protected topological phases via tensor networks, using anomaly-free cohomology group cocycles and explicit tensor consistency conditions. This could advance the study of quantum phases of matter with higher symmetry.

Abstract: We introduce two-dimensional tensor network representations of finite groups
carrying a 4-cocycle index. We characterize the associated gapped (2+1)D phases
that emerge when these anomalous symmetries act on tensor network ground
states. We further develop related tensor network unitaries that generate
symmetric states representing (3+1)D symmetry protected topological phases.
Although aspects of these constructions have been previously addressed, our
contribution unifies them within a single tensor network framework and
emphasizes the explicit formulation of local tensor equations encoding global
consistency conditions.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Fusion-based photonic quantum computer uses deterministic sources, adaptive fusions, and optimized design to achieve low optical depth and resource efficiency. Error thresholds indicate scalability for fault-tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a significant challenge in quantum computing: scalability through efficient resource management and deterministic photon sources. It offers a promising approach to overcome current limitations in photonics-based quantum systems.

Method: The method combines deterministic photon emission, adaptive fusion techniques, and an optimized architectural design, integrating time-bin qubit encoding and reconfigurable sources. Quantum dot devices are utilized, and simulations of error thresholds are conducted using intrinsic device errors.

Result: A blueprint is presented for a practical, low-optical-depth photonic quantum computer with scalable error correction capabilities, requiring resources proportional to code distance. The proposed system is estimated to perform logical qubit operations within microseconds.

Conclusion: The research provides a feasible solution for building scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computers, leveraging deterministic sources and efficient architectures, making it an important step toward large-scale quantum computing applications.

Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computing is an attractive model for fault-tolerant
computation based on photonics requiring only finite-sized entangled resource
states followed by linear-optics operations and photon measurements.
Large-scale implementations have so far been limited due to the access only to
probabilistic photon sources, vulnerability to photon loss, and the need for
massive multiplexing. Deterministic photon sources offer an alternative and
resource-efficient route. By synergistically integrating deterministic photon
emission, adaptive repeat-until-success fusions, and an optimised architectural
design, we propose a complete blueprint for a photonic quantum computer using
quantum dots and linear optics. It features time-bin qubit encoding,
reconfigurable entangled-photon sources, and a fusion-based architecture with
low optical connectivity, significantly reducing the required optical depth per
photon and resource overheads. We present in detail the hardware required for
resource-state generation and fusion networking, experimental pulse sequences,
and exact resource estimates for preparing a logical qubit. We estimate that
one logical clock cycle of error correction can be executed within
microseconds, which scales linearly with the code distance. We also simulate
error thresholds for fault-tolerance by accounting for a full catalogue of
intrinsic error sources found in real-world quantum dot devices. Our work
establishes a practical blueprint for a low-optical-depth, emitter-based
fault-tolerant photonic quantum computer.

### [73] [Pulse-Level Simulation of Crosstalk Attacks on Superconducting Quantum Hardware](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16181)
*Syed Emad Uddin Shubha,Tasnuva Farheen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The key problem is hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers, which can be a major security threat by allowing adversaries to inject pulses causing targeted errors. The paper presents a simulation-based analysis, creating a three-qubit model to examine attack strategies and discusses detection and mitigation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for secure quantum computing in a multi-tenant environment, as hardware crosstalk poses significant security risks.

Method: Simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level, modeling a three-qubit system to examine attack strategies and analyze resulting logical errors.

Result: Identified vulnerabilities in certain quantum protocols, providing insights into mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: Strengthen security in quantum cloud platforms by understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of secure pulse injection control and detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Hardware crosstalk in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers poses a
severe security threat, allowing adversaries to induce targeted errors across
tenant boundaries by injecting carefully engineered pulses. We present a
simulation-based study of active crosstalk attacks at the pulse level,
analyzing how adversarial control of pulse timing, shape, amplitude, and
coupling can disrupt a victim's computation. Our framework models the
time-dependent dynamics of a three-qubit system in the rotating frame,
capturing both always-on couplings and injected drive pulses. We examine two
attack strategies: attacker-first (pulse before victim operation) and
victim-first (pulse after), and systematically identify the pulse and coupling
configurations that cause the largest logical errors. Protocol-level
experiments on quantum coin flip and XOR classification circuits show that some
protocols are highly vulnerable to these attacks, while others remain robust.
Based on these findings, we discuss practical methods for detection and
mitigation to improve security in quantum cloud platforms.

### [74] [Statistical Assertions for Debugging Quantum Circuits and States in CUDA-Q](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16255)
*Jocelyn Li,Ella Rubinshtein,Margaret Martonosi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a debugging workflow for CUDA-Q using statistical assertions to detect qubit state deviations, improving upon Qiskit-based tools by employing Fisher's exact test and Monte Carlo Method, enhancing reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing's maturation requires efficient debugging tools. Developers struggle with complex circuits, leading to errors. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by providing a more reliable debugging method in CUDA-Q.

Method: The research extends prior Qiskit-based debuggers by inserting statistical assertions within quantum circuits. It uses Fisher's exact test and Monte Carlo Method to evaluate qubit state distribution, addressing the limitations of the chi-square test. Additionally, the method considers CUDA-Q's kernel-based programming model for better debugging tool design.

Result: The proposed approach effectively detects qubit state deviations, improving the reliability of quantum circuit debugging. The statistical methods used show better accuracy and efficiency compared to existing tests.

Conclusion: This work enhances CUDA-Q's usability and reliability, providing a solid foundation for future quantum computing applications and software development tools.

Abstract: As quantum computing continues to mature, more developers are designing,
coding, and simulating quantum circuits. A challenge exists, however, in
debugging quantum circuits, particularly as they scale in size and complexity.
Given the lack of effective debugging workflows, developers are forced to
manually inspect their circuits and analyze various quantum states, which is
error-prone and time-consuming.
  In this research, we present a statistical assertion-based debugging workflow
for CUDA-Q. CUDA-Q has gained popularity due to its ability to leverage GPUs to
accelerate quantum circuit simulations; this allows circuits to scale to larger
depths and widths, where they can be particularly hard to debug by hand.
Inspired by and building from prior Qiskit-based debuggers, our work allows
CUDA-Q users to verify quantum program correctness with greater ease. Through
the insertion of statistical assertions within a quantum circuit, our tool
provides valuable insights into the state of qubits at any point within a
circuit, tracks their evolution, and helps detect deviations from expected
behavior. Furthermore, we improve the reliability and accuracy of the product
state assertion by using a combination of Fisher's exact test and the Monte
Carlo Method instead of a chi-square test, and examine the impact of CUDA-Q's
distinct kernel-based programming model on the design of our debugging tool.
This work offers a practical solution to one of CUDA-Q's usability gaps, paving
the way for more reliable and efficient quantum software development.

Abstract: In the present work we propose a novel quantum material concept, which
enables super- and/or ultrastrong interaction of two-level systems with the
photonic field in a complex network. Within the mean field approximation we
examine phase transition to superradiance that results in two excitation
(polariton) branches and is accompanied by the appearance of non-zero
macroscopic polarization of two-level systems. We characterize the statistical
properties of networks by the first, ${\langle}k{\rangle}$, and second
normalized, $\zeta\equiv{\langle}k^2{\rangle}/{\langle}k{\rangle}$, moments for
node degree distribution. We have shown that the Rabi frequency is essentially
enhanced due to the topology of the network within the anomalous domain where
${\langle}k{\rangle}$ and $\zeta$ sufficiently grow. The multichannel
(multimode) structure of matter-field interaction leads superstrong coupling
that provides primary behavior of the high temperature phase transition. The
results obtained pave the way to design new photonic and polaritonic circuits,
quantum networks for efficient processing quantum information at high (room)
temperatures.

Abstract: The preparation of quantum Gibbs states is a fundamental challenge in quantum
computing, essential for applications ranging from modeling open quantum
systems to quantum machine learning. Building on the Meta-Variational Quantum
Eigensolver framework proposed by Cervera-Lierta et al.(2021) and a problem
driven ansatz design, we introduce two meta-learning algorithms:
Meta-Variational Quantum Thermalizer (Meta-VQT) and Neural Network Meta-VQT
(NN-Meta VQT) for efficient thermal state preparation of parametrized
Hamiltonians on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Meta-VQT
utilizes a fully quantum ansatz, while NN Meta-VQT integrates a quantum
classical hybrid architecture. Both leverage collective optimization over
training sets to generalize Gibbs state preparation to unseen parameters. We
validate our methods on upto 8-qubit Transverse Field Ising Model and the
2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms, demonstrating efficient thermal
state generation beyond training data. For larger systems, we show that our
meta-learned parameters when combined with appropriately designed ansatz serve
as warm start initializations, significantly outperforming random
initializations in the optimization tasks. Furthermore, a 3- qubit Kitaev ring
example showcases our algorithm's effectiveness across finite-temperature
crossover regimes. Finally, we apply our algorithms to train a Quantum
Boltzmann Machine (QBM) on a 2-qubit Heisenberg model with all field terms,
achieving enhanced training efficiency, improved Gibbs state accuracy, and a
30-fold runtime speedup over existing techniques such as variational quantum
imaginary time (VarQITE)-based QBM highlighting the scalability and
practicality of meta-algorithm-based QBMs.

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits play a key role in quantum computing.
Measuring the suitability of such a circuit for solving a class of problems is
needed. One such promising measure is the expressivity of a circuit, which is
defined in two main variants. The variant in focus of this contribution is the
so-called dimensional expressivity which measures the dimension of the
submanifold of states produced by the circuit. Understanding this measure needs
a lot of background from differential topology which makes it hard to
comprehend. In this article we provide this background in a vivid as well as
pedagogical manner. Especially it strives towards being self-contained for
understanding expressivity, e.g. the required mathematical foundations are
provided and examples are given. Also, the literature makes several statements
about expressivity the proofs of which are omitted or only indicated. In this
article we give proofs for key statements from dimensional expressivity,
sometimes revealing limits for generalizing them, and also sketching how to
proceed in practice to determine this measure.

Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) have been predominantly driven by discrete-variable
(DV) architectures. Yet, many optical platforms naturally generate Gaussian
states--the common states of continuous-variable (CV) systems, making CV-based
QNs an attractive route toward scalable, chip-integrated quantum computation
and communication. To bridge the conceptual gap between well-studied DV
entanglement percolation theories and their CV counterpart, we introduce a
Gaussian-to-Gaussian entanglement distribution scheme that deterministically
transports two-mode squeezed vacuum states across large CV networks. Analysis
of the scheme's collective behavior using statistical-physics methods reveals a
new form of entanglement percolation--negativity percolation theory
(NegPT)--characterized by a bounded entanglement measure called the ratio
negativity. We discover that NegPT exhibits a mixed-order phase transition,
marked simultaneously by both an abrupt change in global entanglement and a
long-range correlation between nodes. This distinctive behavior places CV-based
QNs in a new universality class, fundamentally distinct from DV systems.
Additionally, the abruptness of this transition introduces a critical
vulnerability of CV-based QNs: conventional feedback mechanism becomes
inherently unstable near the threshold, highlighting practical implications for
stabilizing large-scale CV-based QNs. Our results not only unify statistical
models for CV-based entanglement distribution but also uncover previously
unexplored critical phenomena unique to CV systems, providing valuable insights
and guidelines essential for developing robust, feedback-stabilized QNs.

Abstract: Topological materials, known for their edge states robust against local
perturbations, hold promise for next-generation quantum technologies, but
remain scarce in nature and challenging to realize in static systems. The
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain is a one-dimensional system for topological phases,
although its static control is limited. To overcome these limitations, we
propose to use high-frequency monochromatic driving and modulated amplitude
pulses to dynamically induce and switch the Floquet topological phases. Using a
Kramers-Henneberger-like transformation, we encode all Floquet sidebands into a
single effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that both monochromatic and
experimental pulse protocols (Gaussian and fast-beating envelopes) can induce
topological edge states, enabling dynamic phase switching. Notably,
fast-beating modulations require significantly lower field strengths than
monochromatic ones, especially with larger inter-dimer separations. Our
findings offer an experimentally feasible route for Floquet engineering, paving
the way for ultrafast and energy efficient control of topological phases in
quantum platforms, opening up new possibilities in the field of dynamic quantum
materials.

Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable
precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and
electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the
limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and
measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires
optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum
sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum
channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are
typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning
criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian
inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active
information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for
non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step,
and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum
sensing agents.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a technique in quantum information science used
to reconstruct the density matrix of an unknown quantum state, providing
complete information about the quantum state. It is of significant importance
in fields such as quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum
simulation. However, as the size of the quantum system increases, the number of
measurement settings and sampling requirements for quantum state tomography
grow exponentially with the number of qubits. This not only makes experimental
design and implementation more complex, but also exacerbates the consumption of
experimental resources. These limitations severely hinder the application of
state tomography in large-scale quantum systems. To reduce measurement settings
and improve sampling efficiency, this study proposes a state tomography method
based on auxiliary systems. This method can be implemented through either
entanglement between the quantum system to be measured and a quantum auxiliary
system or through correlation between the quantum system and a probabilistic
classical auxiliary system. Measurements on the entire joint system enable more
efficient extraction of information about the quantum state to be measured.
This method relies on standard quantum gate operations and requires only two
measurement settings, with a total sampling complexity of $O(d^2)$,
significantly simplifying experimental operations and measurement processes.
Additionally, this study provides two schemes for measuring purity based on the
proposed circuit, one of which achieves measurement precision at the Heisenberg
limit. This study validates the effectiveness of the proposed method through a
detailed theoretical analysis, a series of numerical simulations, and
experiments.

Motivation: Achieving quantum advantage is a critical goal in quantum computing, and this paper contributes to solving the problem by focusing on non-stabilizer states, which are essential but underutilized.

Method: The authors combine resource theory with quantum state geometry, introducing metrics that evaluate non-stabilizer effects beyond the influence of Clifford operations. They apply these methods to analyze both structured and unstructured variational approaches, assessing algorithm efficiency.

Result: The study reveals variations in non-stabilizer efficiency between structured and unstructured methods and suggests ways to minimize unnecessary resource consumption, offering a framework for constructing more effective quantum algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper provides a novel approach to analyzing and utilizing non-stabilizer states, advancing the development of quantum algorithms with demonstrated advantages. It suggests targeted strategies for optimizing quantum computational resources, implying greater potential for practical quantum applications.

Abstract: While superiority of quantum over classical computation has been established,
the repertoire of primitives with proven or conjectured quantum advantage
remains limited. Despite considerable progress in delineating the
quantumclassical divide, the systematic construction of algorithms with quantum
advantage remains challenging, which can be attributed to a still incomplete
understanding of the sources of quantum computational power. While intermediate
non-stabiliserness (i.e., traversal of states outside the Clifford orbit)
indicates necessary non-classical behaviour for quantum advantage, naively
equating non-stabiliserness and non-classicality is misguided: Even random Haar
sampled states exhibit near-maximal non-stabiliserness. Advancing towards
quantum advantage calls for a better understanding of the efficient use of
non-stabiliser states. We present an approach to track the behaviour of
non-stabiliserness across various algorithms by pairing resource theory of
non-stabiliser entropies with the geometry of quantum state evolution, and
introduce permutation agnostic distance measures that reveal non-stabiliser
effects previously hidden by a subset of Clifford operations. We find different
efficiency in the use of non-stabiliserness for structured and unstructured
variational approaches, and show that greater freedom for classical
optimisation in quantum-classical methods increases unnecessary non-stabiliser
consumption. Our results open new means of analysing the efficient utilisation
of quantum resources, and contribute towards the targeted construction of
algorithmic quantum advantage.

*Stéphane Virally*

TL;DR: Maxwell's equations can be written like Schrödinger's, but for photon density, Mandel didn't quite connect the dots. However, their adaptation works for photons' number expectation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the connection between Maxwell's equations and quantum optics is key for developing quantum technologies, which often rely on photons' behavior.

Method: The paper forms Maxwell's equations analogously to Schrödinger's and then connects it through photon number density, pointing out limitations but also highlighting where their approach is effective.

Result: They achieved a consistent framework but only for photon number expectations, not directly linking Mandel's wavefunction to Maxwell's.

Conclusion: The adapted approach successfully models photon number distributions, which enhances quantum optics studies and applications.

Abstract: Maxwell's equations in the vacuum can be formally cast in the form of
Schr\"odinger's equation. Unfortunately, the vector to which this equation
directly applies is not a wavefunction: its amplitude squared is not a
probability density but the expected energy density of the field. Since we can
count photons, there must be a more convincing wavefunction, derived from the
EM field, whose amplitude squared is an expected photon density. Mandel
proposed the second quantized version of such a wavefunction, but did not link
it directly to the EM field. We show how this can be accomplished.

Abstract: We propose an efficient protocol to realize multi-qubit gates in arrays of
neutral atoms. The atoms encode qubits in the long-lived hyperfine sublevels of
the ground electronic state. To realize the gate, we apply a global laser pulse
to transfer the atoms to a Rydberg state with strong blockade interaction that
suppresses simultaneous excitation of neighboring atoms arranged in a
star-graph configuration. The number of Rydberg excitations, and thereby the
parity of the resulting state, depends on the multiqubit input state. Upon
changing the sign of the interaction and de-exciting the atoms with an
identical laser pulse, the system acquires a geometric phase that depends only
on the parity of the excited state, while the dynamical phase is completely
canceled. Using single qubit rotations, this transformation can be converted to
the C$_k$Z or C$_k$NOT quantum gate for $k+1$ atoms. We also present extensions
of the scheme to implement quantum gates between distant atomic qubits
connected by a quantum bus consisting of a chain of atoms.

### [86] [Isocoherent Work Extraction from Quantum Batteries: Basis-Dependent Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16610)
*Shuva Mondal,Debarupa Saha,Ujjwal Sen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper connects quantum coherence to the maximum extractable work from quantum batteries. Coherence-constrained maximal work decreases with increasing coherence in some cases and increases in others, depending on the basis. Analytical and numerical results show that the work's dependence on coherence is modulated by the basis chosen. Passive states are discussed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of quantum coherence in energy extraction is crucial for quantum thermodynamics. This paper provides insights into how coherence affects the maximum work extractable from quantum systems.

Method: Analytical derivations for qubits, numerical simulations for higher dimensions.

Result: In qubits, CCMW depends inversely on coherence in one basis but directly in another. Numerical evidence shows similar patterns in higher dimensions, allowing closed-form relations within certain bounds.

Conclusion: Quantum coherence's impact on extractable work varies with the measurement basis, offering basis-dependent design strategies for quantum devices optimizing energy extraction.

Abstract: We identify a connection between quantum coherence and the maximum
extractable work from a quantum battery, and to this end, we define the
coherence-constrained maximal work (CCMW) as the highest amount of work
extractable via coherence-preserving unitaries, optimized over all quantum
states with fixed coherence in a given dimension. For qubit systems, we derive
an analytical relation between the CCMW and the input coherence, defined with
respect to an arbitrary fixed basis. Strikingly, we find that for fixed quantum
coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the maximal extractable work decreases with
increase of coherence. In contrast, when quantum coherence is with respect to a
basis for which the Hamiltonian possesses off-diagonal elements, and has equal
diagonal elements, the CCMW increases with the level of quantum coherence. We
numerically observe that the basis-dependent response of the CCMW also persists
in higher-dimensional quantum systems. Moreover, we show that even in higher
dimensions one can derive closed-form relations between the CCMW and the input
quantum coherence within certain numerically-assessed conclusions. We also
comment on the structure of passive states in an isocoherent scenario, that is,
states from which no energy can be extracted under coherence-preserving
unitaries.

Abstract: Thermal operations are quantum channels that have taken a prominent role in
deriving fundamental thermodynamic limitations in quantum systems. We show that
these channels are uniquely characterized by a purely quantum information
theoretic property: They admit a dilation into a unitary process that leaves
the environment invariant when applied to the equilibrium state. In other
words, they are the only channels that preserve equilibrium between system and
environment. Extending this perspective, we explore an information theoretic
idealization of heat bath behavior, by considering channels where the
environment remains locally invariant for every initial state of the system.
These are known as catalytic channels. We show that catalytic channels provide
a refined hierarchy of Gibbs-preserving maps for fully-degenerate Hamiltonians,
and are closely related to dual unitary quantum circuits.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an RL framework for synthesizing efficient quantum circuits by addressing the exponential state space issue through tabular Q-learning and hybrid rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient synthesis of quantum circuits is crucial in NISQ and beyond, as quantum states grow exponentially with qubits, making brute force infeasible. This paper tackles this challenge with RL.

Method: Uses tabular Q-learning with action sequences, discretized state space, and hybrid reward mechanism (static guidance + dynamic penalties). Sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization aid scalability and efficiency.

Result: The algorithm efficiently finds minimal-depth circuits for graph-state preparation, even scaling to seven qubits. Extensions to universal gates show similar performance, indicating robustness.

Conclusion: This RL approach provides a scalable, resource-efficient solution for quantum circuit synthesis, advancing quantum computing's practicality.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

TL;DR: The paper examines multi-qubit quantum states corresponding to bipartite graphs, derives their entanglement distance analytically, and establishes relationships between entanglement and vertex degrees. Quantum protocols are proposed to determine the number of vertices with odd and even degrees, and these are verified using quantum simulations, including noise models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper deals with quantum states and their entanglement properties related to graph structures. It proposes new methods to analyze and quantify graph properties using quantum tools, which is relevant to both quantum computing and graph theory.

Method: The paper uses analytical methods to derive entanglement distances and relationships between entanglement and graph vertex degrees. It employs quantum simulations on the AerSimulator to verify these relationships, specifically for star graphs and general bipartite graphs.

Result: The results show that the entanglement distance depends on graph structure and parameters, and the quantum protocols accurately determine vertex degrees with odd and even characteristics. The simulations confirm the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The findings provide a bridge between quantum information and graph theory, offering new tools for analyzing graph properties through quantum means. These advancements have potential applications in quantum computing, information processing, and network analysis.

Abstract: Multi-qubit quantum states corresponding to bipartite graphs $G(U,V,E)$ are
examined. These states are constructed by applying $CNOT$ gates to an arbitrary
separable multi-qubit quantum state. The entanglement distance of the resulting
states is derived analytically for an arbitrary bipartite graph structure. A
relationship between entanglement and the vertex degree is established.
Additionally, we identify how quantum correlators relate to the number of
vertices with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. Based on these
results, quantum protocols are proposed for quantifying the number of vertices
with odd and even degrees in the sets $U$ and $V$. For a specific case where
the bipartite graph is a star graph, we analytically calculate the dependence
of entanglement distance on the state parameters. These results are also
verified through quantum simulations on the AerSimulator, including noise
models. Furthermore, we use quantum calculations to quantify the number of
vertices with odd degrees in $U$ and $V$. The results agree with the
theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: This study represents a significant advancement in neuromorphic systems by integrating quantum mechanics, offering a new direction for AI and autonomy with enhanced capabilities in information processing and security.

Abstract: A synthetic artificial neuron network functional in a regime where quantum
information processes are co-integrated with spiking computation provides
significant improvement in the capabilities of neuromorphic systems in
performing artificial intelligence and autonomy tasks. This provides the
ability to execute with the qubit coherence states and entanglement as well as
in tandem to perform functions such as read out and basic arithmetic with
conventional spike-encoding. Ultimately, this enables the generation and
computational processing of information packets with advanced capabilities and
an increased level of security in their routing. We now use the dynamical pulse
sequences generated by a memristive spiking neuron to drive synthetic neurons
with built-in superconductor-ionic memories built in a lateral layout with
integrated Niobium metal electrodes as well as a gate terminal and an atomic
layer deposited ionic barrier. The memories operate at very low voltage and
with direct, and hysteretic Josephson tunneling and provide enhanced coherent
properties enabling qubit behavior. We operated now specifically in burst mode
to drive its built-in reconfigurable qubit states and direct the resulting
quantum trajectory. We analyze the new system with a Hamiltonian that considers
an integrated rotational dependence, dependent on the unique co-integrated
bursting mode spiking- and where the total above threshold spike count is
adjustable with variation of the level of coupling between the neurons. We then
examined the impact of key parameters with a longer-term non-Markovian quantum
memory and finally explored a process and algorithm for the generation of
information packets with a coupled and entangled set of these artificial neuron
qubits that provides for a quantum process to define the level of regularity or
awareness of the information packets.

Motivation: The paper investigates the computational complexity of tasks related to quantum channels, which is significant for understanding the practical limitations of quantum information processing systems.

Method: Analysis of NP-hardness using reductions to known NP-hard problems and semidefinite programming bounds are employed.

Result: Approximating the contraction coefficient is NP-hard, and decided quantities like optimal success probabilities are NP-hard as well.

Conclusion: These results highlight the NP-hard nature of tasks related to quantum channel properties, suggesting challenges in designing efficient quantum algorithms for these problems.

Abstract: We show that approximating the trace norm contraction coefficient of a
quantum channel within a constant factor is NP-hard. Equivalently, this shows
that determining the optimal success probability for encoding a bit in a
quantum system undergoing noise is NP-hard. This contrasts with the classical
analogue of this problem that can clearly by solved efficiently. Our hardness
results also hold for deciding if the contraction coefficient is equal to 1. As
a consequence, we show that deciding if a non-commutative graph has an
independence number of at least 2 is NP-hard. In addition, we establish a
converging hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds on the
contraction coefficient.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) crystals offer a route to scale up trapped ion systems
for quantum sensing and quantum simulation applications. However, engineering
coherent spin-motion couplings and effective spin-spin interactions in large
crystals poses technical challenges associated with decoherence and prolonged
timescales to generate appreciable entanglement. Here, we explore the
possibility to speed up these interactions in 3D crystals via parametric
amplification. We derive a general Hamiltonian for the parametric amplification
of spin-motion coupling that is applicable to crystals of any dimension in both
rf Paul traps and Penning traps. Unlike in lower dimensional crystals, we find
that the ability to faithfully (uniformly) amplify the spin-spin interactions
in 3D crystals depends on the physical implementation of the spin-motion
coupling. We consider the light-shift (LS) gate, and the so-called
phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen (MS) gates, and
find that only the latter gate can be faithfully amplified in general 3D
crystals. We discuss a situation where non-uniform amplification can be
advantageous. We also reconsider the impact of counter-rotating terms on
parametric amplification and find that they are not as detrimental as previous
studies suggest.

Abstract: Gaussian quantum probes have been widely used in quantum metrology and
thermometry, where the goal is to estimate the temperature of an environment
with which the probe interacts. It was recently shown that introducing initial
position-momentum (PM) correlations in such probes can enhance the estimation
precision compared to standard, uncorrelated Gaussian states. Motivated by
these findings, we investigate whether PM correlations can also be advantageous
in a simultaneous estimation setting, specifically, when estimating both the PM
correlations themselves and the effective environment temperature that
interacts with the probe. Using the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix, we
derive new precision bounds for this joint estimation task. Additionally, we
demonstrate that such correlations can serve as a resource to improve
temperature estimation within this multiparameter context. Finally, we analyze
the compatibility between the two parameters, establishing conditions under
which the derived bounds can be saturated.

Result: They achieved high fidelities of over 80% in various quantum state measurements and logical operations, demonstrating the potential for scalable quantum logic modules.

Conclusion: The teleported CNOT gate could be extended to support large-scale distributed quantum computation, opening new possibilities for practical quantum applications.

Abstract: Large-scale quantum computers possess the capacity to effectively tackle
practical problems that can be insurmountable for classical computers. The main
challenge in building these quantum computers is to realize scalable modules
for remote qubits and entanglement. By assembling small, specialized parts into
a larger architecture, the modular approach mitigates complexity and
uncertainty. Such a distributed architecture requires non-local quantum gate
operations between remote qubits. An essential method for implementing such
operations, known as quantum gate teleportation, requires only local
operations, classical communication, and shared entanglement. Till today, the
quantum gate teleportation using a photonic chip has remained elusive. Here we
experimentally demonstrate the quantum teleportation of an on-chip
controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, assisted with the scalable silicon chip platform,
high-fidelity local quantum logic gates, linear optical components,
post-selected entanglement, and coincidence measurements from photonic qubits.
First, we measure and characterize our teleported chip-scale CNOT gate with an
average truth table fidelity of 93.1 +- 0.3%. Second, for different input
polarization states, we obtain an average quantum state fidelity of 87.0 +-
2.2% with our teleported on-chip CNOT gate. Third, we use our non-local CNOT
gate for remote entanglement creation of four Bell states, with an average
quantum state fidelity of 86.2 +- 0.8%. Fourthly, we fully characterize our
teleported on-chip CNOT gate with a quantum process fidelity 83.1 +- 2.0%, and
an average non-local CNOT gate fidelity of 86.5 +- 2.2%. Our teleported
photonic on-chip quantum logic gate could be extended both to multiple qubits
and chip-scale modules towards fault-tolerant and large-scale distributed

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spin relaxation dynamics of V_B^- centers is crucial for advancing quantum sensing technologies, particularly at high magnetic fields where current knowledge is limited.

Method: The researchers measured spin relaxation dynamics over a temperature range of 15-250 K and magnetic fields up to 7 T, corresponding to a ground-state splitting of approximately 200 GHz. They observed transitions in relaxation mechanisms from spin-spin interactions and disorder effects at low fields to single-phonon processes at higher fields. Scaling behaviors were extracted to quantify interactions with the environment.

Result: The findings reveal distinct relaxation regimes characterized by different mechanisms, which aid in modeling and optimizing V_B^- centers for high-field quantum sensing applications.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for developing high-field, sub-terahertz quantum sensors using two-dimensional spin defects based on hBN.

Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy center ($\mathrm{V_B^-}$) in hexagonal
boron nitride ($\mathrm{hBN}$) has attracted attention for its potential
applications in quantum sensing. While GHz-scale sensing at low magnetic fields
has been demonstrated with these defects, their behavior at high fields remains
largely unexplored. We investigate the spin relaxation dynamics of
$\mathrm{V_B^-}$ centers over temperatures of $15-250$ K and magnetic fields of
up to $7$ T, corresponding to a ground-state splitting of $\sim 200$ GHz. Our
results uncover distinct relaxation regimes, transitioning from
spin-spin-interaction-driven and disorder-induced stretched exponential
dynamics at low temperatures and fields to relaxation dominated by
single-phonon processes at elevated magnetic fields. We extract temperature-
and magnetic-field-dependent scaling behaviors of the relaxation rate to
provide a quantitative picture of the interactions between $\mathrm{V_B^-}$
centers and their environment. Our results pave the way towards high-field,
sub-terahertz quantum sensors based on two-dimensional spin-defect platforms.

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes are essential to the implementation of
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Homological products of classical codes
offer a versatile framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes
with desirable properties, especially quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC)
codes. Based on extensions of the Bravyi--K\"{o}nig theorem that encompass
codes without geometric locality, we establish a series of general no-go
theorems for fault-tolerant logical gates supported by hypergraph product
codes. Specifically, we show that non-Clifford logical gates cannot be
implemented transversally on hypergraph product codes of all product
dimensions, and that the dimensions impose various limitations on the
accessible level of the Clifford hierarchy gates by constant-depth local
circuits. We also discuss examples both with and without geometric locality
which attain the Clifford hierarchy bounds. Our results reveal fundamental
restrictions on logical gates originating from highly general algebraic
structures, extending beyond existing knowledge only in geometrically local,
finite logical qubits, transversal, or 2-dimensional product cases, and may

### [97] [Toward Routine CSP of Pharmaceuticals: A Fully Automated Protocol Using Neural Network Potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16218)
*Zachary L. Glick,Derek P. Metcalf,Scott F. Swarthout*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated crystal structure prediction protocol that significantly improves efficiency and reduces costs, making it practical for use in early drug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is vital in pharmaceutical development but faces high computational costs and requires expert knowledge. This paper aims to develop an automated and high-throughput protocol to overcome these barriers.

Method: The protocol uses Lavo-NN, a neural network potential, integrated into a scalable cloud workflow. It processes over 49 diverse molecules, generating and ranking crystal structures, and achieves significant time and cost savings.

Result: The protocol successfully predicts all 110 Z'=1 experimental polymorphs with a benchmark average of 8.4k CPU hours per molecule. It also validates practicality through case studies in data resolution and semi-blinded identification.

Conclusion: This automated approach makes crystal structure prediction more accessible and efficient, potentially revolutionizing early stages of drug discovery by enabling broader application with fewer resources.

Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is a useful tool in pharmaceutical
development for identifying and assessing risks associated with polymorphism,
yet widespread adoption has been hindered by high computational costs and the
need for both manual specification and expert knowledge to achieve useful
results. Here, we introduce a fully automated, high-throughput CSP protocol
designed to overcome these barriers. The protocol's efficiency is driven by
Lavo-NN, a novel neural network potential (NNP) architected and trained
specifically for pharmaceutical crystal structure generation and ranking. This
NNP-driven crystal generation phase is integrated into a scalable cloud-based
workflow. We validate this CSP protocol on an extensive retrospective benchmark
of 49 unique molecules, almost all of which are drug-like, successfully
generating structures that match all 110 $Z' = 1$ experimental polymorphs. The
average CSP in this benchmark is performed with approximately 8.4k CPU hours,
which is a significant reduction compared to other protocols. The practical
utility of the protocol is further demonstrated through case studies that
resolve ambiguities in experimental data and a semi-blinded challenge that
successfully identifies and ranks polymorphs of three modern drugs from powder
X-ray diffraction patterns alone. By significantly reducing the required time
and cost, the protocol enables CSP to be routinely deployed earlier in the drug
discovery pipeline, such as during lead optimization. Rapid turnaround times
and high throughput also enable CSP that can be run in parallel with
experimental screening, providing chemists with real-time insights to guide
their work in the lab.

Result: 该方法显著降低了结构误差和计算误差，提高了TS的发现速率和优化效率。

Conclusion: 该方法可加速反应机制的发现，并推动新材料、催化剂和药物开发。

Abstract: Identifying transition states (TSs), the high-energy configurations that
molecules pass through during chemical reactions, is essential for
understanding and designing chemical processes. However, accurately and
efficiently identifying these states remains one of the most challenging
problems in computational chemistry. In this work, we introduce a new
generative AI approach that improves the quality of initial guesses for TS
structures. Our method can be combined with a variety of existing techniques,
including both machine learning models and fast, approximate quantum methods,
to refine their predictions and bring them closer to chemically accurate
results. Applied to TS guesses from a state-of-the-art machine learning model,
our approach reduces the median structural error to just 0.088
$\unicode{x212B}$ and lowers the median absolute error in reaction barrier
heights to 0.79 kcal mol$^{-1}$. When starting from a widely used tight-binding
approximation, it increases the success rate of locating valid TSs by 41\% and
speeds up high-level quantum optimization by a factor of three. By making TS
searches more accurate, robust, and efficient, this method could accelerate
reaction mechanism discovery and support the development of new materials,
catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.

Abstract: We present a machine-learning workflow for the calculation of the infrared
spectrum of molecules, and more generally of other temperature-dependent
electronic observables. The main idea is to use the Jacobi-Legendre cluster
expansion to predict the real-space charge density of a converged
density-functional-theory calculation. This gives us access to both energy and
forces, and to electronic observables such as the dipole moment or the
electronic gap. Thus, the same model can simultaneously drive a molecular
dynamics simulation and evaluate electronic quantities along the trajectory,
namely it has access to the same information of ab-initio molecular dynamics. A
similar approach within the framework of machine-learning force fields would
require the training of multiple models, one for the molecular dynamics and
others for predicting the electronic quantities. The scheme is implemented here
within the numerical framework of the PySCF code and applied to the infrared
spectrum of the uracil molecule in the gas phase.

TL;DR: Error

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The development of ammonia-methane (NH3-CH4) combustion as a hydrogen-carrier
energy source faces major challenges such as significant NOx emissions,
hindering its practical implementation. This paper examines how ethanol (C2H6O)
and methanol (CH4O) additives influence formation pathways of NOx using ReaxFF
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at temperatures of 2,000 K and 3,000 K. Ten
carefully designed fuel mixtures (C1-C10) were evaluated across 0%, 5%, and 10%
alcohol concentrations. The findings show that adding alcohol can effectively
suppress NOx production, especially at elevated temperatures. At 3,000 K, 10%
ethanol addition and 10% methanol addition reduced the production of NOx by
approximately 39.6% and 30.1%, respectively, compared with the base fuel. This
suppression is attributed to the charge redistribution and the redirection of
nitrogen intermediates through stabilising pathways such as HNO, HNO2, and N2O.
Simulation-derived descriptors served as the training data for machine learning
(ML) models, including Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector
Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), and Fully Connected
Neural Networks (FCNN). RFR achieved superior performance compared with other
models with an R2 of 0.993 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.661. The trained
ML models successfully predicted NOx emissions for both simulated alcohol
ratios (0%, 5% and 12%), and non-simulated alcohol ratios (2%, 7%, and 12%)
which demonstrating how hybrid physics-informed ML algorithms can extrapolate
complex chemical behaviours, along with prediction errors under 5% for most
extrapolated ethanol cases. The results showcase that the ReaxFF informed ML
framework successfully serves as a basis for designing cleaner fuels and is
capable of establishing a reliable structure for future predictive models in
combustion chemistry.

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计环境响应式电子材料提供了理论依据，适用于信息处理技术。

Abstract: Conducting polymer dendrite (CPD) morphogenesis is an electrochemical process
that unlocks the potential to implement in materio evolving intelligence in
electrical systems: As an electronic device experiences transient voltages in
an open-space wet environment, electrically conductive structures physically
change over time, programming the filtering properties of an interconnect as a
non-linear analog device. Mimicking the self-preservation strategies of some
sessile organisms, CPDs adapt their morphology to the environment they grow in.
Either studied as an electrochemical experiment or as neuromorphic devices, the
dependence of CPDs' electrical properties on the chemical nature of their
environment is still unreported, despite the inter-dependence between the
electrical properties of the electrogenerated material and the chemical
composition of their growth medium. In this study, we report on the existing
intrication between the nature and concentration of the electrolytes,
electroactive compounds and co-solvents and the electrical and the
electrochemical properties of CPDs in water. CPDs exhibit various chemical
sensitivities in water: their morphology is highly dependent on the nature of
the chemical resources available in their environment. The selection of these
resources therefore critically influence morphogenesis. Also, concentrations
have different impacts on growth dynamics, conditioning the balance between
thermodynamic and kinetic control on polymer electrosynthesis. By correlating
the dependencies of these evolving objects with the availability of the
chemical resources in an aqueous environment, this study proposes guidelines to
tune the degree of evolution of electronic materials in water. Such hardware is
envisioned to exploit the chemical complexity of real world environments as
part of information processing technologies.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that semiconductor quantum dots enhance supercapacitor performance through effects like resonance and fluorescence gain, achieving a 2.5x capacitance amplification at 100 mV/s, and can be further enhanced with white light.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore the enhancement of supercapacitor performance through the use of fluorescent quantum dots at the electrolyte-electrode interface, building on previous observations of conductive colloids.

Method: The researchers used cyclic voltammetry and characterization techniques to measure capacitance enhancement, fluormetry to assess quantum dots' fluorescence effects, and examined impact under wet conditions.

Result: Achieved a 2.5x capacitance amplification through QD placement, with enhanced performance when combined with white light. Also observed fluorescence gain in wet samples.

Conclusion: Fluorescent quantum dots offer a scalable method to enhance supercapacitor performance without additional steps or resources, contributing to sustainable energy applications and bioelectronic devices.

Abstract: In the past, we have observed an overall capacitance enhancement in super
capacitors (S-C) when placing small amount of conductive colloids at the
electrolyte/electrode interface with a mass ratio of 1:5000 to the electrode
mass. The capacitance peaked at particular colloid concentration and the
enhancement was attributed to local field effects by formation of an array of
colloids at the interface. Here we show that fluorescing semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs) at the interface exhibit similar effects on the cell capacitance
with a capacitance amplification, measure by cyclic voltammetry (C-V), of more
than 2.5 at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Embedding QDs at the electrolyte/electrode
interface has an added value that it may be further enhanced by white light and
indeed this is the case here. The effect was also correlated with resonating
effect (large signal enhancement) and in the case of wet samples, with line
narrowing of the dots' fluorescence; the latter indicates a substantial
fluorescence gain. Probing the electrolyte/electrode interface with fluorescing
materials adds to our basic knowledge of the interface and could be useful for
light-sensitive S-C cells.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of positron sources is crucial for optimizing electron-positron colliders, leading to higher luminosity and better beam characteristics.

Method: A start-to-end simulation tool was developed, integrating positron production, capture, and beam transport processes. It was benchmarked against existing tools and validated using experimental data from SuperKEKB.

Result: The simulation tool showed very good agreement with experimental data and other simulation tools, with key parameters such as positron yield, primary electron impact position, solenoid field strength, and RF phase settings being effectively modeled.

Conclusion: The developed framework is reliable and can be used for future studies of positron sources, enhancing the performance of electron-positron colliders.

Abstract: High-intensity positron sources are critical for next-generation
electron-positron colliders, where positron beam quality and characteristics
directly impact the luminosity. Accurate modeling and validated simulation
tools for positron sources are essential to optimize their performance.
However, modeling a positron source tends to be complex, as it involves
multiple interdependent stages, from positron production and capture dynamics
to beam transport through the injector linac to the collider ring. A reliable
simulation framework should integrate these processes to ensure efficient
positron production and transport. In this work, we present a start-to-end
simulation tool developed for positron sources modeling. The model was
benchmarked against existing simulation tools and validated through
experimental measurements conducted at the SuperKEKB positron source. Key
operational parameters were systematically scanned to evaluate the simulation
model performance, including the primary electron impact position on the
target, solenoid field strength around the capture linac, and RF phase
settings. The primary Figure-of-Merit for all validation tests was the positron
yield at the end of the SuperKEKB positron capture section. The simulation
results demonstrate a very good agreement with experimental data and other
simulation tools, confirming the model's reliability and establishing a
framework for future positron source studies.

Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a bilayer of antiparallel dipolar excitons with
a 1:2 density ratio between the layers, as a function of temperature and
density. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that such a system
supports the formation of trimers, namely, three-exciton bound states
consisting of a single dipole in one layer and two dipoles in the second layer.
At sufficiently low temperatures and densities, these trimers condense into a
trimer superfluid phase. Increasing the excitonic density induces a quantum
phase transition into a phase in which condensates of independent dipoles exist
in both layers, in parallel to the trimers. We also study the thermal
transitions out of these phases, and find that while the normal state is
reached directly from the trimer superfluid, the thermal disordering of the
two-superfluid phase involves an intermediate state which is either a trimer
superfluid or a single excitonic condensate in the denser layer. A potential
experimental realization using transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures
is discussed.

Motivation: The paper explores how voltage pulses from STM tips can induce specific surface structures, contributing to nanoscale surface manipulation.

Result: Formation of Bi BL islands and craters, controlled by voltage and bulk properties, with islands moving over microns.

Conclusion:  STM-based nanomanipulation feasible via voltage pulses, applicable in nanotechnology and catalysis.

Abstract: We report the formation of Bi(111) bilayer (BL) islands and crater structures
on Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) surfaces induced by voltage pulses from an STM tip. Pulses
above a threshold voltage ($+3$ V) produce craters $\sim 0.5$ microns in
diameter, similar to the size of the tip. Redeposited material self-assembles
into a network of atomically ordered islands with a lattice constant identical
to the underlying Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. The island size monotonically decreases
over several microns from the pulse site, until the pristine Bi$_2$Te$_3$
surface is recovered. We assign these islands to Bi BL based on atomic
resolution images, analysis of step heights, and tunneling spectroscopy. The
dependence of bilayer formation on bias polarity and the evidence for defect
diffusion together suggest a mechanism driven by the interplay of field
evaporation and tunneling-current-induced Joule heating.

Abstract: Long-life interlayer excitons (IXs) in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)
heterostructure are promising for realizing excitonic condensates at high
temperatures. Critical to this objective is to separate the IX ground state
(the lowest energy of IX state) emission from other states emissions. Filtering
the IX ground state is also essential in uncovering the dynamics of correlated
excitonic states, such as the excitonic Mott insulator. Here, we show that the
IX ground state in WSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer can be separated from other states
by its spatial profile. The emissions from different moire IX modes are
identified by their different energies and spatial distributions, which fits
well with the rate-diffusion model for cascading emission. Our results show
spatial filtering of the ground state mode and enrich the toolbox to realize
correlated states at elevated temperatures.

TL;DR: Abstract discusses the application of Stokes polarimetry to measure sublattice polarization in bipartite photonic lattices, achieving precise determination of Bloch modes and Hamiltonian with potential for broader applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a novel application of Stokes polarimetry, traditionally used for light polarization, to the study of sublattice degrees of freedom in photonic lattices. This could open new avenues for understanding topological and quantum properties in materials with additional spin-like structures.

Method: The method involves using k-space photoluminescence intensity measurements with controlled phase shifts and attenuations on each sublattice. It utilizes honeycomb arrays of coupled microcavities to realize photonic analogs of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. Stchlorombination polarimeter based on these measurements is developed and used to reconstruct Bloch modes with high precision.

Result: The approach achieves sub-linewidth precision in determining the eigenenergies of Bloch modes, especially near band touching points, allowing access to the system's Bloch Hamiltonian and quantum geometric tensor. They also suggest extensions to more complex systems with additional degrees of freedom, enabling studies of topological phases like Chern insulators and Euler-class topology.

Conclusion: The work opens up new possibilities for实验 investigating topological and geometric properties of materials with multiple internal degrees of freedom using polarimetry techniques designed for light.

Abstract: The concept of pseudo-spin provides a general framework for describing
physical systems featuring two-component spinors, including light polarization,
sublattice degrees of freedom in bipartite lattices, and valley polarization in
2D materials. In all cases, the pseudo-spin can be mapped to a Stokes vector on
the Poincar\'e sphere. Stokes polarimeters for measuring the polarization of
light are a powerful tool with a wide range of applications both in classical
and quantum science. Generalizing Stokes polarimetry to other spinor degrees of
freedom is thus a challenge of prime importance. Here, we introduce and
demonstrate a Stokes polarimeter for the sublattice polarization in a bipartite
photonic lattice. Our method relies on k-space photoluminescence intensity
measurements under controlled phase shifts and attenuations applied
independently to each sublattice. We implement our method using honeycomb
arrays of coupled microcavities realizing photonic analogs of graphene and
hexagonal boron nitride. Using our sublattice polarimeter, we reconstruct the
Bloch modes in amplitude and phase across the Brillouin zone, achieving
sub-linewidth precision in the determination of their eigenenergies, including
near band touching points. This enables full access to the system Bloch
Hamiltonian and quantum geometric tensor. Our approach can readily be extended
to more complex systems with additional internal degrees of freedom, enabling
experimental investigations of trigonal warping, Chern insulating phases, and
Euler-class topology in multigap systems.

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic
properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau
levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's
operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles,
i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum
Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the
thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat
engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other
graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer
graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal
that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while
achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though
the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and
QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we
identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict
adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the trion peak in two-dimensional semiconductors, showing that the trion binding energy is influenced by the exciton's structure, challenging conventional interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic structure of transition metal dichalcogenides is crucial for their application in optoelectronics and spintronics. The trion peak provides insights into carrier interactions and exciton formation.

Method: Theoretical modeling involving exciton and trion wave functions, focusing on their binding energies and asymmetry.

Result: The model explains trion energy measurements in MoSe2 and WSe2, emphasizing the role of exciton structure in optical response.

Conclusion: This study corrects the interpretation of the trion-exciton splitting, highlighting the internal exciton structure as a critical factor in understanding these materials' optical properties.

Abstract: Exciton spectroscopy serves as a sensitive probe of electronic states in
two-dimensional semiconductors. A prominent feature in optical spectra is the
trion peak arising from the binding of a charge carrier to an exciton. The
splitting between the exciton and trion peaks is usually interpreted as the
trion binding energy, but we theoretically show that this view is incomplete.
Since dark excitons are more strongly bound than the bright exciton, the trion
wave function is asymmetric and a large contribution to the measured splitting
is the difference between the bright and dark exciton binding energies. Our
model quantitatively explains the measured trion energies in MoSe2 and WSe2,
demonstrating the importance of the internal structure of the exciton for the
interpretation of the optical response of transition metal dichalcogenides.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how time modulation can enhance thermal radiation, which has implications for materials science and energy applications, especially under dynamic conditions or for active control.

Method: Floquet theory, nonequilibrium Green's functions, phonon polaritons, and radiative coupling analysis.

Result: Far-field thermal radiation exceeds static limits; radiative output depends on modulation strength and temperature effects.

Conclusion: Time modulation is effective for controlling near-to-far field transitions with applications in thermal management.

Abstract: Time modulation introduces a dynamic degree of freedom for tailoring thermal
radiation beyond the limits of static materials. Here we investigate far-field
thermal radiation from a periodically time-modulated SiC film under the Floquet
nonequilibrium Green's function framework. We show that time modulation enables
radiative energy transfer into the far field that surpasses the limit imposed
by the equilibrium thermal fluctuations. This enhancement originates from the
modulation-induced coupling between evanescent surface phonon polaritons and
propagating modes, effectively bridging the energy and momentum mismatch
through frequency conversion. Notably, even at zero temperature, the film emits
a finite radiative heat flux due to nonequilibrium photon occupation generated
by the modulation. The radiative output grows with increasing modulation
strength, highlighting the role of external work in driving far-field emission.
These results establish time modulation as an effective mechanism for bridging
near-field and far-field regimes, opening new pathways for active thermal
radiation control.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Focused electron-beam induced deposition (FEBID) has emerged as a powerful
technique for shifting from direct-write fabrication of two- to
three-dimensional nanostructures, which reflects a broader movement across
nanotechnology as a whole. Fields such as nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and
energy storage and harvesting are poised to benefit from a new generation of
greener, more versatile, and multifunctional technologies enabled by this
transition to 3D structures. The availability of numerous precursors enables
the deposition of a wide range of materials, including metallic, organic,
semiconducting, magnetic, and superconductors. While materials fabricated using
FEBID typically contain significant amounts of impurities, several strategies
have been developed to achieve high purity. These include the synthesis of new
precursors, optimizing growth conditions, introducing reactive gases during the
growth process, and post-deposition purification techniques.Although iron
(Fe)-based deposits are gaining particular interest due to their potential
applications in nanomagnetism and spintronics, FEBID of Fe has not developed
significantly due to several challenges, mainly controlling the e-beam reaction
with Fe precursors which often results in low yield growth due to a slow
dissociation reaction. This work advances the controlled FEBID of complex 3D Fe
nanostructures by further refining the spatial dwell-time resolution map to
print complex structures within nm feature accuracy, through quantitatively
calibrating Monte Carlo simulations with the measured experimental growth
profiles. The methodology, visualized in 3D graphs, enables high shape fidelity
in Fe growth and maintains the ongoing growth across multiple complex
structures through predictive tuning of model parameters based on input
geometry, an outcome that was previously unachievable for Fe.

*Xin Chen,Eugen Dizer,Emilio Ramos Rodríguez,Richard Schmidt*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The abstract introduces a unified theory connecting the quasiparticle picture of Fermi polarons and the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe, revealing a mass gap that plays a central role in the formation of in-gap states and phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to bridge the theoretical understanding of quantum impurities in fermionic systems, specifically examining how impurities affect the collective excitations and phase transitions.

Method: The method involves operator reordering of a many-body Hamiltonian to derive a mass gap and analyze phase transitions.

Result: A mass gap is identified as a critical factor in quasiparticle weight and the polaron-to-molecule transition.

Conclusion: The mass gap provides a foundational mechanism for understanding phase transitions in systems with mobile impurities.

Abstract: We present a unified theory that connects the quasiparticle picture of Fermi
polarons for mobile impurities to the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe for
static impurities. By operator reordering of the underlying many-body
Hamiltonian, we obtain a modified fermionic dispersion relation that features a
recoil-induced energy gap, which we call the `mass gap'. We show that the
resulting mean-field Hamiltonian exhibits an in-gap state for finite impurity
mass, which takes a key role in Fermi polaron and molecule formation. We
identify the mass gap as the microscopic origin of the quasiparticle weight of
Fermi polarons and derive a power-law scaling of the weight with the
impurity-to-fermion mass ratio. The associated in-gap state is shown to give
rise to the emergence of the polaron-to-molecule transition away from the
limiting case of the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in which the transition
is absent.

### [114] [Beyond fragmented dopant dynamics in quantum spin lattices: Robust localization and sub-diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042)
*Mingru Yang,Sajant Anand,Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper studies the motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices using state-of-the-art numerical methods. It shows that at nonzero temperatures, dopants are localized due to an emergent disordered potential, only becoming delocalized asymptotically at zero temperature. The delocalization follows a power-law behavior influenced by spin-exchange processes. High-temperature behavior shows a diffusive nature with an Arrhenius relation for the diffusion coefficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about understanding the behavior of dopants in magnetic systems, which is a key area in condensed matter physics, particularly relevant to high-temperature superconductivity.

Method: State-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations were used to investigate non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg t-J ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions, especially in the Ising limit and with spin-exchange processes.

Result: Dopants are localized at nonzero temperatures but can delocalize with power-law behavior depending on spin-exchange strength. High temperature shows diffusive behavior with Arrhenius scaling for the diffusion coefficient.

Conclusion: This work provides deeper insights into dopant motion, crucial for understanding high-temperature superconductivity and magnetism at finite temperatures.

Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous
attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature
superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of
their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In
this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding
based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we
investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$--$J$
ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we
find that the dopant is \emph{localized} for all investigated \emph{nonzero}
temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization
length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice,
whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This
greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert
space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant
delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive
for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough
exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite
temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative
differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows
self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian
behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient
follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially
decreases for decreasing temperatures.

TL;DR: This paper explores the ground states of two-component Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates in 3D, revealing rich structures including cubic lattices and density segregation upon varying interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum systems, particularly BECs, is important for understanding fundamental physics and has applications in quantum technologies. Exploring ground states helps identify stable configurations useful for these applications.

Method: The authors use a combination of theoretical modeling, solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equations, and numerical simulations to analyze the system's behavior under varying scattering lengths and interaction strengths.

Result: The research identifies various ground state configurations, such as cubic structures and density segregation patterns, which depend on inter-component and intra-component interaction parameters.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the complex behavior of multi-component BECs, offering potential directions for controlling and manipulating these systems in quantum devices and simulations.

Abstract: We explore phases of two-component Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensates
in three spatial dimensions. The competition between the effective ranges of
inter- and intra-component soft-core interactions leads to a rich variety of
ground states. These include states resembling ionic compounds with
face-centered cubic or simple cubic lattice structure. Upon increasing the
scattering length, the dimensionality of the symmetry-breaking is lower due to
the suppression of large densities, leading to segregated planar or tubular
density profiles. We also show that these states are not only stable ground
states, but can also emerge dynamically upon time evolution.

Abstract: Dual lattices such as honeycomb and hexagonal lattices typically obey
Babinet's principle in optics, which states that the expected interference
patterns of two complementary diffracting objects are identical and
indistinguishable, except for their overall intensity. Here, we study
Kapitza--Dirac diffraction of Bose--Einstein condensates in optical lattices
and find that matter waves in dual lattices obey Babinet's principle only under
the condition of weak-pulse Raman--Nath regimes. In contrast, the
Kapitza--Dirac matter-wave diffraction in the strong-pulse Raman--Nath regime
(corresponding to the phase wrapping method we developed to generate
sub-wavelength phase structures in Sci. Rep. 10, 5870 (2020)) can break
Babinet's principle and clearly resolve the distinct interference patterns of
the dual honeycomb and hexagonal lattices. This method offers exceptional
precision in characterizing lattice configurations and advance the study of
symmetry-related phenomena, overcoming the limitations of real-space imaging.

Conclusion: 该研究为 Rydberg 原子阵列提供了新的实验平台，揭示了引入振动后的复杂量子相变和热化行为，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum science and technology has established
Rydberg atom arrays as a premier platform for exploring quantum many-body
physics with exceptional precision and controllability. Traditionally, each
atom is modeled as a spin degree of freedom with its spatial motion effectively
frozen. This simplification has facilitated the discovery of a rich variety of
novel equilibrium and non-equilibrium phases, including $\mathbb{Z}_{\text{N}}$
symmetry-breaking orders and quantum scars. In this work, we investigate the
consequences of incorporating atomic vibrations in optical tweezers, which give
rise to spin-phonon coupling. For systems in thermal equilibrium, we find that
this coupling leads to a new symmetry-breaking phase in the weak driving limit,
as a result of induced three-spin interactions. Furthermore, we show that the
violation of quantum thermalization in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered states is
suppressed when spin-phonon coupling is introduced. Our results are readily
testable in state-of-the-art Rydberg atom array experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the understanding of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity by formulating master field equations, leveraging Horndeski theory.

Method: The authors construct master field equations by using 2D Horndeski theory to define a conserved gravitational tensor, enabling coupling to spherically symmetric stress-energy tensors and proving theorems in this context.

Result: The framework derived includes the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem generally, offering a powerful toolset for exploring black hole physics and spacetime dynamics.

Conclusion: This framework sets up the stage for studying spacetime dynamics beyond general relativity in spherically symmetric settings and aids in exploring a new black hole physics paradigm.

Abstract: I construct a set of master field equations encompassing all possible
second-order field equations for spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond
general relativity. The structure of 2-dimensional Horndeski theory is
leveraged to define a spherically symmetric gravitational tensor that is
identically conserved and can play an equivalent role as the Einstein tensor in
the coupling to spherically symmetric stress-energy tensors. The master field
equations provide a framework in which to study a wide variety of previously
intractable problems and prove general results across different theories, as
illustrated with the example of the Jebsen--Birkhoff theorem that holds
generally. This work sets up the stage for the study of the dynamics of
spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity and provides
powerful tools for the exploration of a new paradigm of black hole physics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an efficient method for parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy, which bypasses the need for expensive stochastic samplers. The method uses smart parameter selection and computational techniques to estimate the posterior distributions quickly, enabling quick and accurate analysis with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses a significant computational challenge in gravitational wave astronomy, which is the efficient estimation of parameters from compact binary coalescence events. The method presented aims to solve this problem without relying on stochastic methods, which can be computationally intensive.

Method: The paper's approach involves selecting parameter sets to cover the phase space efficiently and computing likelihoods using dot products. It also assesses and enhances integration accuracy to ensure predictable and adaptable results, making the method both efficient and reliable.

Result: The method allows for full parameter estimation in minutes on a single CPU and has potential for GPU acceleration. It supports large waveform banks and can handle precessing compact binary mergers regardless of the waveform generation cost.

Conclusion: This approach significantly improves the computational efficiency of parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy, making complex analyses much faster and more feasible without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events
observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW
astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution
efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to
select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the
relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all
combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess
and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable
to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes
on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple
CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package,
enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing
CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of
waveform generation cost.

Result: 分为两种光束结构，第一种是平面波，第二种对应Taub-NUT时空。

Conclusion: 推广方法有效，对称性约束下能生成重要时空。

Abstract: The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild
transformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in
flat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to
the high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its
symmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically
significant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example
is the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to
lead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we
propose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the
stationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance
under null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions,
the classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence
is covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields
an axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave
displays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the
exterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a
special case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild
black hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise
to a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020
(2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization
invariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the
latter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar
topology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr
theorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential
spacetimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Theoretical physicists exploring quantum properties of dark matter and their impact on black hole physics.

Method: Examined quantum entanglement and coherence for fermionic and bosonic fields in Schwarzschild black hole spacetimes with PFDM halos.

Result: PFDM's density affects quantum states, with bosons being more sensitive to entanglement changes and fermions affecting coherence more.

Conclusion: Choosing appropriate quantum probes for dark matter detection depends on quantum resource types, as different fields respond differently to PFDM effects in curved spacetime.

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains undetected, and developing theoretical models such
as the promising perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is a key challenge in modern
cosmology. In this work, we investigate the quantum characteristics of PFDM by
analyzing the behavior of quantum entanglement and coherence for both fermionic
and bosonic fields near a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a PFDM halo. Our
results reveal that PFDM can either enhance or degrade quantum entanglement and
coherence, depending sensitively on its density. Notably, bosonic entanglement
shows greater susceptibility to PFDM effects compared to fermionic
entanglement, while fermionic coherence exhibits a stronger dependence on PFDM
than its bosonic counterpart. These findings highlight the necessity of
selecting appropriate quantum probes for DM detection based on the type of
quantum resources, as different quantum fields exhibit significantly different
responses to PFDM in curved spacetime.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores a novel approach to general relativity and Yang-Mills theories by considering emergent fields where spacetime and gauge fields are not fundamental but arise from a more foundational phase space. This leads to modified theories that avoid traditional uniqueness theorems, offering new physics like nonsingular black holes and possible applications to dark matter. Made possible by advanced mathematical frameworks. New results include more general solutions for black holes and cosmological models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents an ambitious approach to unify theories by eliminating fundamental fields, using an elegant framework that allows exploration of new physics and applications in modified gravity and dark matter. This could shake up our understanding of spacetime and gravity.

Method: The method involves starting from a canonical formulation of phase space, analyzing covariance under Background Independence, and constructing field theories where spacetime and gauge fields emerge naturally. Symmetry reductions and dynamical systems are used to test the theories, explicitly solving for scenarios like black holes and cosmology.

Result: The approach successfully circumvents uniqueness theorems, leading to solutions that resolve singularities and allow for new gravitational effects and models for dark matter without dark matter particles. Explicit solutions demonstrate the theory's viability and physical implications.

Conclusion: Emergent field theories propose a fundamentally new framework for spacetime and gauge fields, offering potential resolutions to long-standing physics issues and novel explanations for dark matter without dark matter particles. The results are significant and open new avenues for research in fundamental physics and cosmology.

Abstract: The uniqueness theorems for general relativity and Yang-Mills theories can be
circumvented by dropping the ubiquitous, yet often implicit, assumption that
physical fields, such as the spacetime metric, are fundamental. The novel
concept of emergent fields makes it possible to construct modified theories of
gravity and forces where the spacetime metric and strength tensor fields emerge
from a covariance analysis in the canonical formulation with nontrivial
relations to the fundamental phase space and no additional degrees of freedom
are required. This is an example of a post-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory that
implies new physics. In particular, explicit realizations of the theory in
symmetry-reduced systems have shown robust resolutions of the singularities
that plague the classical theories in regions of extreme spacetime curvature,
including nonsingular (SU(2)xU(1)-charged) black holes with a cosmologial
constant and collapsing solutions, as well as Gowdy and FLRW cosmologies.
Further applications include modifications in the spectrum of quasinormal modes
and in the evaporation process of black holes, as well as relativistic
formulations of long-range gravitational effects capable of modeling MOND as an
alternative solution to the dark matter problem. New results here include an
extension of the spherically symmetric system that couples SU(2) gauge fields
and the generalization of previous dynamical, homogeneous solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a comprehensive Hamiltonian approach for relativistic fluid dynamics in spacetime, addressing challenges in incorporating relativistic and gravitational effects.

Method: Developed a relativistic Poisson algebra and Hamiltonian framework, applied to Schwarzschild metric for stationary solutions and perturbative analysis.

Result: Exact solutions for radial flows in Schwarzschild spacetime and a perturbative stability analysis were obtained.

Conclusion: A unified Hamiltonian formulation is presented, providing a foundation for studying astrophysical and cosmological fluid phenomena.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive Eulerian (Hamiltonian) framework for relativistic
fluid dynamics in curved spacetimes, with emphasis on Schwarzschild geometry.
The key innovation lies in the consistent use of density and three-velocity
fields, all defined in coordinate (Newtonian) time, while fully incorporating
relativistic and curvature effects. {\it We stress that the entire dynamics is
developed in coordinate (Eulerian) time, from the viewpoint of a static
Eulerian observer.} In the non-relativistic regime, it is well known that
Poisson brackets between the density $\rho(\vec{x}, t)$ and velocity fields
$v^i(\vec{x}, t)$, together with an appropriate Hamiltonian, yield the
continuity and Euler equations as Hamiltonian equations of motion. These
field-theoretic Poisson brackets can be derived from canonical phase-space
brackets defined on Lagrangian variables $(x_i, p_j)$, mapped to Eulerian
fields $(\rho, v^i)$. We extend this framework to curved spacetime by
constructing a relativistic version of the Eulerian Poisson algebra and
proposing a corresponding Hamiltonian. This yields relativistic continuity and
Euler equations valid in generic spacetimes, with evolution in coordinate time.
Applying this to the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain exact stationary
background solutions for radial flows and perform a perturbative stability
analysis. We also introduce a generalised vorticity and examine its effect on
perturbations over irrotational backgrounds, revealing its role in flow
stability. This work offers a unified, first-principles Hamiltonian formulation
of relativistic fluid dynamics in curved geometries, forming a foundation for
further study of astrophysical and cosmological fluid phenomena.

Abstract: We are exploring the possibility of traversable wormholes existing in a more

constructing wormholes with double power-law density distributions, drawing
inspiration from the Dehnen-type dark matter halo in the framework of
generalized geometry-matter coupling gravity. Our investigation carefully
considers the challenges of traversability and stability, as well as the roles
of exotic matter, the exoticity parameter, and the anisotropy parameter. We
have discovered solutions that describe asymmetric, asymptotically flat
traversable wormholes, supported by a smooth metric and double power-law
density distributions. These solutions successfully avoid the problems, giving
us hope that such wormholes could actually exist in nature.

Conclusion: 证明自由引力熵在引力坍缩到蒸发过程中平滑过渡，熵的本质来源是广义相对论的几何结构。

Abstract: We present a robust mechanism where the geometrical free-gravitational
entropy of an isolated astrophysical radiating star undergoing continual
gravitational collapse, as measured by an external observer, makes a smooth
transition to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the onset of the horizon
formation and in the late times of black hole evaporation. It is interesting to
note that both in the classical regime and the semi classical evaporating black
hole regime, the matter is radiated via the Vaidya exterior surrounding the
radiating star, as well as the evaporating black hole. Our result, being
independent of the interior matter dynamics of the collapsing star, clearly
indicates that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its non-extensive nature
indeed originates from the Riemannian geometry, which dictates the free-gravity
entropy in general relativity.

Abstract: Black hole quasinormal modes arise as eigenmodes of a non-normal Hamiltonian
and consequently they do not obey orthogonality relations with respect to
commonly used inner products, for example, the energy inner product. A direct
consequence of this is the appearance of transient phenomena. This review
summarises current developments on the topic, both in frequency- and
time-domain. In particular, we discuss the appearance of i) transient plateaus:
arbitrarily long-lived sums of quasinormal modes, corresponding to localised
energy packets near the future horizon; ii) transient growth, with the latter
either appearing in the vicinity of black hole phase transitions or in the
context of higher-derivative Sobolev norms.

TL;DR: The paper presents a nonlinear framework for studying spacetime analogs in topological materials, showing how these materials can simulate gravitational phenomena like black hole horizons and Hawking radiation, going beyond linear approximations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergent spacetime models in condensed matter provide an avenue to simulate and explore aspects of gravitational physics in controlled settings. This paper aims to extend the existing studies by incorporating nonlinear effects, which are often ignored in favor of linear approximations.

Method: The authors developed a nonlinear wave equation governing radial perturbations of density and velocity fields in a topological material. They used graphene as a representative system, calculating its properties from first principles, and numerically demonstrated the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantified analog Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes.

Result: The study demonstrates that topological materials, such as graphene, can simulate complex gravitational phenomena through nonlinear effects, allowing for the exploration of horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission beyond linear approximations.

Conclusion: This work establishes topological materials as versatile platforms for simulating nonlinear gravitational phenomena, bridging condensed matter physics and the study of spacetime analogs, opening new avenues for exploring black hole physics and other gravitational effects in controlled laboratory environments.

Abstract: Emergent spacetime analogs in condensed matter systems have opened a
fascinating window into simulating aspects of gravitational physics in
controlled laboratory environments. In this work, we develop a comprehensive
nonlinear analog gravity framework within a topological material, incorporating
the impact of Berry curvature on the hydrodynamic flow of electrons. Unlike
prevalent studies in existing literature limited to linear perturbations, we
derive and analyze a fully nonlinear wave equation governing radial
perturbations of density and velocity fields, which dynamically generate an
effective acoustic metric. Taking the example of graphene as a representative
system, and calculating its properties from first principles, we numerically
demonstrate the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantify analog
Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes. Our findings suggest
that topological materials can serve as versatile platforms to probe rich
gravitational phenomena, including horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission,
beyond conventional linear approximations. This work lays the groundwork for
exploring nonlinear emergent spacetime in a broad class of quantum materials,
bridging condensed matter physics and gravitational analogs.

*Gonzalo J. Olmo,João Luís Rosa,Diego Rubiera-Garcia,Alejandro Rueda,Diego Sáez-Chillón Gómez*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses parametrized black hole models and uses observations of M87* to constrain their parameters, arguing that future VLBI could distinguish these from Schwarzschild.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the need to test alternative theories of gravity against observations, aiming to differentiate between them using high-resolution imaging techniques.

Method: The authors use parametrized models (JP and KZ) adjusted to constrain certain black hole features, then simulate interferometric observations to assess distinguishability.

Result: The simulations suggest that future VLBI could differentiate these parametrized models from Schwarzschild.

Conclusion: This work provides a method to test alternative gravity models using future astronomical observations, highlighting potential for distinguishing different black hole models.

Abstract: We discuss the optical appearance from thin accretion disks in parametrized
black holes, namely, solutions characterized by an arbitrarily large number of
parameters without any regards to the theory of the gravitational and matter
fields they come from. More precisely, we consider the leading-order terms of
the spherically symmetric Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) and Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ)
parametrizations after imposing constraints from asymptotic flatness and solar
system observations. Furthermore, we use the inferred correlation, by the Event
Horizon Telescope Collaboration, between the size of the bright ring (which is
directly observable) and the size of the central brightness depression (which
is not) of M87 and Sgr A$^*$ central supermassive objects, to constrain the
parameters of the leading-order JP and KZ solutions. Using ten samples of the
Standard Unbound distribution previously employed in the literature to
reproduce certain scenarios of General Relativistic HydroDynamical simulations,
we produce images of four samples of JP and KZ geometries enhancing and
diminishing the shadow's size, respectively. Via a qualitative and quantitative
analysis of the features of the corresponding photon rings and, in particular,
of their relative brightness, we argue that it should be possible to
distinguish between such parametrized solutions and the Schwarzschild geometry
via future upgrades of very long baseline interferometry. We furthermore
consider images of some naked objects within these parametrizations, and also
discuss the role of inclination in comparing images of different black holes.

Abstract: The conversion of gravitational to electromagnetic waves in the presence of
background magnetic fields is known as the inverse Gertsenshtein effect,
analogous to the Primakoff effect for axions. Rephrasing this conversion as a
classical electrodynamics problem in the far-field regime of a magnetized
region, we derive the angular distribution of the intensity and polarization of
the emitted electromagnetic waves. We discuss the interplay of the internal
structure of the magnetic field, the polarization of the gravitational wave and
the scattering angle, demonstrating for example that a dipolar field can
convert an unpolarized stochastic gravitational wave background into polarized
electromagnetic emission, with peak emission intensity along the equator. We
moreover outline how to incorporate medium effects in this framework, necessary
for a realistic 3D description of gravitational wave to photon conversion in
the magnetosphere of neutron stars.

Conclusion: 该研究推论出非极小耦合的 Dark Matter 是一个有潜力的解释，可以同时解决宇宙学中的几个关键问题。

Abstract: We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled
to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard
Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that
this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase
of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems
without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to
spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial
singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally
coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the
singularity and fine-tuning problems.

Conclusion: 结论是，通过对 Diff 对称性的系统研究并引入额外的场，可以更深入地理解宇宙学背景下的标量场行为，并将其应用到暗物质的研究中，为解释 dark energy 和 dark matter 的行为提供新框架。

Abstract: We study theories breaking diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance down to the
subgroup of transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff), consisting of multiple scalar
fields in a cosmological background. In particular, we focus on models
involving a field dominated by its kinetic term and a field dominated by its
potential, coupled to gravity through power-law functions of the metric
determinant. The Diff symmetry breaking results in the individual
energy-momentum tensors not being conserved, although the total
conservation-law is satisfied. Consequently, an energy exchange takes place
between the fields, acting as an effective interaction between them. With this
in mind, we consider the covariantized approach to describe the theory in a
Diff invariant way but with an additional field, and discuss the
phenomenological consequences of these models when it comes to the study of the
dark sector.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores quantum gravity tunneling processes through Loop Quantum Gravity and spinfoam models, focusing on 3D Euclidean gravity. It identifies dominant geometries in the classically forbidden regime, showing their contributions are exponentially suppressed semiclassically. This sheds light on black-to-white hole transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum gravity transitions, especially between black holes and white holes, is a key goal in theoretical physics. Tunneling processes offer a promising approach to explore these scenarios, making this paper's investigation relevant.

Method: Forces the paper to employ Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and spinfoam models. It uses these frameworks to study tunneling amplitudes in 3D Euclidean gravity by analyzing dihedral angles as boundary data, focusing on the semiclassical limit through analytic continuation.

Result: The main result is that non-classical geometries dominating the spinfoam amplitude are exponentially suppressed in the semiclassical limit. This provides a clearer understanding of the suppression mechanism in quantum gravity tunneling processes, connected to the transitions between black holes and white holes.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that quantum tunneling processes between black holes and white holes can be effectively modeled using covariant LQG and spinfoam models, with non-classical geometries playing a crucial role and their suppression providing insights into the quantum nature of these processes.

Abstract: Tunneling processes offer a promising path for finding signatures of quantum
gravity. While tunneling of geometry has long been recognized in the
literature, few detailed analyses have been carried out. We investigate
covariant Loop Quantum Gravity transitions in the holonomy representation,
which naturally encodes the extrinsic curvature of boundary states. We study
these amplitudes within the simple framework of the Ponzano-Regge spinfoam
model for three-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity. Having identified the
geometries that dominate the spinfoam path integral in the classically
forbidden regime when it is formulated in terms of dihedral angles as boundary
data, we argue that they correspond to tunneling processes. Finally, we
characterize these non-classical geometries and show that their contributions
to the spinfoam amplitude are exponentially suppressed in the semiclassical
limit via analytic continuation of the discrete gravity action. This work sheds
light on quantum black-to-white-hole transitions, in particular clarifying the
origin of the exponential suppression of various quantum amplitudes.

Motivation: 高斯模糊在非交换几何中处理Reissner-Nordström黑洞，可能会揭示更丰富的物理现象，这在引力理论和黑洞研究中具有重要意义。

Method: 通过高斯分布模糊点源，构建 improved energy-momentum tensor，检验爱因斯坦方程满足情况，并探讨能量条件失效的区域。

Result: 度量函数和物理性质看似有效但未满足所有爱因斯坦方程，改进后张量使方程满足，且可能破坏强能量条件，长度外失效。

Conclusion: 高斯模糊可能改善理解黑洞解的科学性，需更深入研究。

Abstract: We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black
hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian
distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the
physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of
Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum
tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to
a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is
violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation
of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important
for observational signatures.

TL;DR: The abstract is brief and doesn't provide detailed information about the paper's content, findings, or contributions, making it difficult to summarize effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research likely focuses on the mathematical analysis of certain nonlinear partial differential equations, specifically the generalized Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchies, aiming to establish their well-posedness, which is fundamental for understanding both the theoretical behavior and practical applications of these equations.

Method: The study likely employs rigorous mathematical analysis, possibly involving functional analysis, energy methods, and harmonic analysis to examine the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data for solutions to the KP hierarchies.

Result: The results probably demonstrate that under certain conditions, the generalized KP hierarchies are well-posed, meaning that solutions exist, are unique, and depend continuously on initial data, contributing to the theoretical framework of soliton equations and their applications in physics.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely emphasizes the significance of the well-posedness results for the broader study of nonlinear wave equations and their behavior in higher dimensions, possibly hinting at future research directions or applications in various scientific fields.
