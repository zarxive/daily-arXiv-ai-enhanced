Conclusion: 该方法简化了对欧拉-Heisenberg 行为的建模过程，无需详细场模拟

Abstract: Electromagnetic waves propagating through vacuum can polarize virtual electron-positron pairs; this polarization, in turn, nonlinearly modifies their propagation. A semi-classical nonlinear wave equation describing the propagation is derived from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian density, which captures vacuum polarization effects up to the one-loop level. Here, we present a reduced-action-integral approach that enables rapid modeling of nonlinear phenomena arising from the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian. Application of the variational principle to the reduced action provides equations of motion for familiar light-pulse parameters, such as spot size, phase, polarization, and phase-front curvature, without requiring full-field simulations. Three examples demonstrate the utility of the approach: phase modulation, birefringence, and frequency mixing.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了Fano干涉在超分辨率显微镜中的潜力，为突破微米级针尖尺寸瓶颈提供了新思路。

Abstract: Apertureless scanning near-field optical microscopy (a-SNOM) is typically limited to ~10 nm resolution by the tip apex size. We demonstrate that ~1-nm resolution can be achieved under continuous-wave (CW) illumination by exploiting Fano path interference. A defect center that naturally forms at the apex of a metal-coated AFM tip acts as a quantum object and induces Fano interference, forcing a stronger but normally off-resonant plasmonic mode (597 nm) to operate effectively on resonance at the driving wavelength (520 nm). Because this interference occurs only beneath the defect, a ~1-nm-wide, strongly enhanced near-field hotspot is created. Using this off-resonant Fano-enhanced field, we achieve single-molecule-resolution imaging based on exact three-dimensional Maxwell simulations.

Conclusion: This advancement in aberration correction enables the creation of larger optical arrays, improving applications in quantum simulation and processing.

Abstract: We propose and implement an aberration correction method for the creation of extended arrays of spots well beyond the isoplanatic region of any optical system. The method relies on an extensive calibration of aberrations in terms of Zernike polynomials over the full accessible field of an optical system. We introduce a modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for generating holographic phase masks creating fully corrected arbitrary arrays of spots. By applying the method to an aspherical lens, and using a liquid-crystal spatial light modulator (SLM), we increase the aberration-free field of view from 50 to 500 $μ$m, only limited by the largest diffraction angles accessible to the SLM. This opens new perspectives for the generation of large arrays of optical tweezers, especially for neutral atom based quantum processors and simulators.

Abstract: Analog coprocessors for neural networks are an intensively developing field. They provide approximate results of computations for relatively low energy cost and at high speed. We show that a set of ring resonators with Brillouin interaction between photons and phonons, being coupled to a waveguide, can be used to implement matrix-vector multiplication. The input vector is formed by occupancies of the anti-Stokes optical modes pumped via spontaneous Brillouin scattering, i.e, scattering on thermal phonons. Brillouin scattering rates and coupling constants between ring resonators and the waveguide form the matrix. The system allows for parallel computations in frequency band.

Abstract: Chromatic dispersion, an inherent wavelength-dependent phenomenon in optical systems, has traditionally been regarded as a detrimental effect to be minimized in imaging and display. Here, we present a paradigm shift by deliberately engineering and harnessing metalens dispersion as a functional mechanism for three-dimensional (3D) near-eye displays. Specifically, we exploit lateral dispersion to transform transverse offset between green and red objects into image-space angular separations that make their images intersected virtually, thereby creating color-merged 3D virtual-image perception. This meta-display architecture preserves compactness of conventional planar display while exhibiting less data requirements and lower hardware complexity than other near-eye 3D displays. Experimentally, we demonstrate a multi-color near-eye 3D system achieving an 11° field of view, 22 pixels-per-degree angular resolution, 0.9 m depth of field, and 19 distinct image planes. This work establishes a new pathway for metasurfaces toward visual displays and highlights great potential for future virtual/augmented reality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently introduced concept of Mie voids allows to enhance the field localization inside air cavities embedded in high-index materials. Mie voids provide an alternative approach to conventional dielectric resonators that confine optical fields within bulk high-index materials. Building on this concept, here we present a hybrid photonic platform that integrates monolayer WS2 with Mie void resonators patterned in a high-index Bi2Te3 substrate. By carefully aligning the dipolar void resonance with the excitonic transition of WS2, we achieve substantially enhanced photoluminescence and second-harmonic generation. Far-field imaging of the harmonic fields reveals spatially resolved hotspots that directly map localized resonant modes, with their positions tunable by cavity geometry and pump wavelength. This approach enables real-space control of nonlinear emission at the single-resonator level, offering a robust and reconfigurable platform for next-generation nonlinear photonics and surface-enhanced optical sensing.

Abstract: Optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum offer additional degrees of freedom. According to the orientation of orbital angular momentum, optical vortices can be classified into spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinalorbital angular momentum and spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum. As an emerging subset of optical vortices, polygonal optical vortices provide a unique platform for a wide range of frontier applications by introducing a new degree of freedom in the form of a customizable intensity structure. In the spatial domain, polygonal spatial optical vortex beam carrying longitudinal orbital angular momentum have already demonstrated great potential in optical manipulation and two-photon lithography. However, polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets contain multiple sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum remains unrealized to date. In this work, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortices wavepackets embedded with prescribed vortex structures. Within the structure, a prescribed number of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices carrying transverse orbital angular momentum is set along a designed polygonal spatiotemporal trajectory. Using the spatiotemporal holographic shaping approach, we generate polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket and use the combination of multiple polygonal perfect spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket to form polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket with the prescribed vortex structure. A full control over multiple key properties of the polygonal spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepackets such as the geometry, number of phase singularities, and spatiotemporal distribution of sub spatiotemporal optical vortices is also achieved.

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, supercontinuum generation spanning more than three octaves in dispersion-engineered thin-film lithium tantalite (TFLT) waveguides. Pumped by a femtosecond laser at 1560 nm, the waveguides yield a spectrum from 240 nm in the ultraviolet to beyond 2400 nm in the near-infrared. The spectral evolution is mapped from low-power harmonic generation (second- and third-harmonic) to a high-power continuum driven by soliton fission and dispersive wave emission. This first demonstration of ultrabroadband nonlinear optics in TFLT establishes it as a competitive, low-loss platform for integrated photonics, with significant potential for applications in frequency metrology and on-chip spectroscopy.

### [9] [Photoacoustic model for laser-induced acoustic desorption of nanoparticles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16403)
*Matthew Edmonds,James Bateman*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for optimal laser design in LIAD systems is presented, improving upon empirical methods. The model identifies key scaling relationships and suggests material alternatives. Experimental validation is provided, showing potential for compact systems with better energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization of portable or space-based optomechanical systems requires efficient laser design for LIAD. Current empirical methods are insufficient for such applications, necessitating a theoretical framework.

Method: Theoretical framework based on the photoacoustic wave equation, analyzing scaling relationships for surface acceleration and acoustic diffraction. Material figures of merit are derived to suggest alternatives to traditional substrates.

Result: The framework is validated experimentally, demonstrating that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance equivalent to existing laboratory systems despite lower pulse energies.

Conclusion: A systematic approach to laser parameter optimization enables the development of efficient, compact LIAD systems for practical applications.

Abstract: Laser-induced acoustic desorption (LIAD) enables loading nanoparticles into optical traps under vacuum for levitated optomechanics experiments. Current LIAD systems rely on empirical optimization using available laboratory lasers rather than systematic theoretical design, resulting in large systems incompatible with portable or space-based applications. We develop a theoretical framework using the photoacoustic wave equation to model acoustic wave generation and propagation in metal substrates, enabling systematic optimization of laser parameters. The model identifies key scaling relationships: surface acceleration scales as $τ^{-2}$ with pulse duration, while acoustic diffraction sets fundamental limits on optimal spot size $w \gtrsim \sqrt{vτd}$. Material figures of merit combine thermal expansion and optical absorption properties, suggesting alternatives to traditional aluminum substrates. The framework validates well against experimental data and demonstrates that compact laser systems with sub-nanosecond pulse durations can achieve performance competitive with existing laboratory-scale implementations despite orders-of-magnitude lower pulse energies. This enables rational design of minimal LIAD systems for practical applications.

Abstract: The scattering of electromagnetic waves by subwavelength rectangular grooves has been extensively studied, yet its physical interpretation has largely relied on field-intensity distri- butions. Here we demonstrate that the transition from concave to convex scattering profiles observed as the groove width approaches the wavelength is governed by a topological reorga- nization of the near-field energy flow. Using a rigorous modal formulation for TM-polarized fields, we analyze the complex electromagnetic field and the associated time-averaged Poynt- ing vector. We show that reducing the groove width induces the creation, migration, and annihilation of Poynting-vector singularities, including vortices and saddle points, leading to a qualitative restructuring of electromagnetic energy transport. This topological transition redirects the local energy flux and manifests as a convex scattering profile in the far field. The results establish a direct link between near-field energy topology and far-field scattering, providing a unified physical interpretation of subwavelength groove scattering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement in machine learning and the need for secure authentication led to the development of this innovative approach using photonic integrated chips.

Method: The RN-ELM leverages an integrated silicon photonic mesh for the physical layer and employs a simple regression algorithm for the digital layer. Non-linearities are generated using non-linear frequency to power mapping from optical filters.

Result: The RN-ELM shows state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction with minimal hardware requirements and demonstrates a highly secure PUF with a cloning probability of 1e-15.

Conclusion: This paradigm offers a promising solution for high-performance machine learning and secure authentication applications, leveraging the unique properties of photonic systems.

Abstract: An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token.

Abstract: We re-examine real-time holography for all-optical structuring of light and optical computation using a contemporary material: a subwavelength-thick, spatially unstructured film of indium tin oxide (ITO). When excited by spatially structured light at epsilon-near-zero frequencies, the film acts as an efficient and reconfigurable diffractive optical platform for all-optical modulation of light such as spatial structuring and optical computations. We demonstrate a few percent of absolute diffraction efficiency over greater than 300 nm bandwidth around telecom wavelengths using a film four orders of magnitude thinner than and up to six orders of magnitude faster than standard holographic materials. Our findings highlight the potential of using epsilon-near-zero-based nanostructures for efficient modulation of spatially structured light and rapid prototyping without complex nanofabrication processes.

Abstract: Topological phase transitions, characterized by the closing and reopening of band gaps and a concomitant change in topological invariants, have played a central role in topological physics. However, such transitions have so far been restricted to spatial crystals, relying solely on energy band gaps and spatial interfaces. Here, we transcend this conventional framework and report, for the first time, spatiotemporal topological phase transition in photonic spacetime crystals - structures that are periodically modulated in both space and time. Using a dynamically modulated transmission line metamaterial, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate complete spatiotemporal topological phase transitions characterized by the closing and reopening of both energy and momentum band gaps, alongside changes in spatiotemporal topological invariants and topological phases. Furthermore, in a genuine photonic spacetime crystal that possesses a complete energy-momentum band gap, we directly observe a space-time topological event that localizes in both space and time, exhibiting relativistic-causality-governed excitation and robustness against spatiotemporal disorders. Our findings reveal the interplay among space, time, and topology, establishing a unified framework that provides a comprehensive picture of the emerging topological space-time physics and opening new avenues for robust spatiotemporal topological wave manipulations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The miniaturization of self-referencing frequency comb systems enables emerging applications in metrology and spectroscopy. One major challenge in realizing the chip-scale self-referencing function is to generate octave-spanning soliton microcombs with low operation power. Accessing soliton states is also not trivial due to the thermal effect. Though an auxiliary laser was utilized to compensate for the thermal effect, deterministic single soliton generation is still elusive, especially for broadband operation. In this work, dispersion management is performed for a 4H-silicon carbide-on-insulator (SiCOI) multi-mode microring resonator, benefiting from the submicron-confinement waveguide layout. The fundamental transverse electric (TE) mode is engineered to anomalous dispersion for two dispersive waves generation over an octave span. While a higher order TE mode is engineered to normal dispersion to accommodate the auxiliary light for thermal compensation. The normal dispersion prevents modulation-instability Kerr comb generation, allowing for a large soliton existence range. We achieve microring resonators with Q up to 5.8 million and sub-milli-watt-threshold Kerr comb generation. Combining the dispersion-managed design and high Q device, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a single soliton comb spanning beyond an octave with a low on-chip power of 60 mW. Our demonstration paves the way to realize chip-scale, turn-key, self-referenced frequency combs.

Abstract: The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) assisted coherent detection has been a cornerstone of modern fiber-optic communication systems. The ability to digitally, i.e. after analogue-to-digital converter, compensate for chromatic dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, and phase noise has rendered traditional analog feedback loops largely obsolete. While analog techniques remain prevalent for phase noise characterization of single-frequency lasers, the phase noise characterization of optical frequency combs presents a greater challenge. This complexity arises from different number of phase noise sources affecting an optical frequency comb. Here, we show how a phase noise measurement techniques method based on multi-heterodyne coherent detection and DSP-based subspace tracking can be used to identify, measure and quantify various phase noise sources associated with an optical frequency comb.

Conclusion: 该研究为高时间分辨率THz探测的系统性效应提供了新的认识，并为探索相应效应出现在哪些条件下了探明了路径。

Abstract: In an ultrafast optical-pump terahertz-probe measurement, the photoinduced material response can be modulated on a timescale shorter than the extent of the THz pulse. In this situation, the measured time-frequency response deviates from a simple time-dependent linear response. When full two-dimensional time-frequency maps are measured, this yields complex features that can be incorrectly assigned to a photoexcited coherent response. We investigate this experimentally via the measured response of photoexcited SnSe, whereby photoinduced phase change dynamics lead to ultrafast changes of the charge carrier and lattice optical conductivity response. Two-dimensional time-frequency THz transmission maps subsequently show unexpected time-frequency features at early pump-probe delay times. These features are reproduced in both finite-difference time-domain simulations of the THz experiment and in an extension of non-equilibrium response function theory, demonstrating their systematic origin. This work improves the understanding of systematic effects in high time resolution optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy, and explores the conditions in which they are likely to appear.

These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one dimension. Two-dimensional (2D) patterns can be realized with two perpendicularly oriented AODs. As the acousto-optical response depends nonlinearly on the applied frequency components, phases, and amplitudes, and in addition experiences dimensional coupling in 2D setups, intensity regulation becomes a unique challenge. Guided by coupled-wave theory and experimental observations, we derive a compute-efficient model which we implement on a graphics processing unit. Only one-time sampling of single-tone laser-power calibration is needed for model parameter determination, allowing for straight-forward integration into optical instruments. We implement and experimentally validate an open-loop diffraction efficiency control system that enables programmable 2D multibeam trajectories with intensity control applied at every time step during digital signal generation, overcoming the limited flexibility, pattern-size constraints, and bandwidth limitations of methods using precalculation and precalibration of a predefined pattern set or closed-loop feedback. The system is capable of stable real-time waveform streaming of arrays with up to 50 x 50 tweezers with minimal time resolution of 1.4 ns (700 MS/s) and a peak latency below 257 microseconds for execution of newly requested patterns. Reactive, real-time 2D multibeam laser patterning and scanning with strict intensity matching will substantially benefit parallelization and increasing data rates in materials processing, microscopy, and optical tweezers.

Abstract: We analyze enhanced optical transmission through subwavelength aper- tures using a modal formulation for the two fundamental polarizations, transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM). Within this frame- work, the fields inside the aperture are described in terms of guided modes whose excitation and interference govern the transmission process. By ex- amining the near-field energy transport through the time-averaged Poynt- ing vector, we show that resonant transmission is accompanied by a pro- nounced reorganization of the energy flow in the vicinity of the aperture. As the wavelength is varied across resonance, the energy transport un- dergoes a topological transition characterized by vortical and saddle-type flow structures, localized backflow regions, and efficient energy funneling through the aperture. These features correlate with strong phase gradi- ents and phase singularities associated with the excited modal fields. The modal approach provides a unified and physically transparent interpre- tation of enhanced transmission in both slits and channels, applicable to perfect conductors and beyond plasmonic regimes.

Abstract: The dispersion engineering of periodic silicon photonic waveguides presents opportunities for significant group delay enhancement compared to uniform waveguides of comparable length. We describe the spectral response characteristics for measured devices and compare their properties to modeled data. These waveguides support the frozen mode regime (FMR) around near infrared wavelengths and are expected to show enhanced group delays around the FMR resonances. Measurements of fabricated devices provide evidence for enhanced delays and spectral properties associated with the FMR. We study how perturbations to the waveguide model impact agreement with measurements and its meaning for these devices operating in the FMR.

Motivation: Monitoring beam parameters in real-time is challenging in synchrotron radiation facilities due to complex collective dynamics, necessitating efficient and accurate methods.

Method: The framework uses a hybrid architecture combining MLP, CNN, and LSTM-Attention sub-networks to predict transverse position, longitudinal phase, and bunch length from waveform data, bypassing traditional serial processing and batch-mode approaches.

Result: The model achieves high accuracy with sub-millisecond latency, validated on experimental data.

Conclusion: The framework enables real-time, multi-parameter diagnostics and active feedback, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Real-time, bunch-by-bunch monitoring of transverse position, longitudinal phase, and bunch length is crucial for beam control in diffraction-limited storage rings, where complex collective dynamics pose unprecedented diagnostic challenges. This study presents a neural network framework that simultaneously predicts these parameters directly from beam position monitor waveforms. The hybrid architecture integrates specialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (LSTM-Attention) sub-networks, overcoming key limitations of traditional methods such as serial processing chains and batch-mode operation. Validated on experimental data from the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and Hefei Light Source, the model achieves high prediction accuracy with a sub-millisecond latency of 0.042 ms per bunch. This performance demonstrates its potential as a core tool for real-time, multi-parameter diagnostics and active feedback in next-generation light sources.

Abstract: We develop and employ general Tree Tensor Networks (TTNs) to compute the vibrational spectra for two model systems: a set of 64-dimensional coupled oscillators and acetonitrile. We explore various tree architectures, ranging from the simple linear structure of Matrix Product States (MPS), to trees where only the leaf nodes carry a physical leg -- as seen in the underlying ansatz of the Multilayer Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method -- and further to more general trees in which all nodes are allowed to possess a physical leg. In addition, we implement Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) methods and Inverse Iteration methods as eigensolvers. By means of comprehensive benchmarking of runtime and accuracy, we demonstrate that sub-wavenumber accuracy in vibrational spectra is achievable with all TTN structures. MPS and three-legged tree tensor network states (T3NS) have similar runtimes, whereas leaf-only trees require significantly more time. All numerical simulations were performed using PyTreeNet, a Python package designed for flexible tensor network computations.

Abstract: The inhomogeneous distribution of P1 centers in type 1b HPHT diamond samples allows multiple DNP mechanisms to occur within the same crystal, resulting in complex DNP spectra. At some crystal orientations, different DNP mechanisms can compete to drive hyperpolarization with different signs at the same applied microwave frequency. We perform microwave-irradiated DNP using both monochromatic and frequency-modulated microwave excitation to explore the competition between these DNP mechanisms in diamond at room temperature. We demonstrate that frequency-modulated DNP is a tool for suppressing certain DNP mechanisms while enhancing others in a single-crystal diamond sample. Frequency modulation also enables higher enhancement of the NMR signal beyond traditional monochromatic DNP under some conditions. In a powder sample, competing enhancement mechanisms can also arise from different crystallite orientations in the powder. We observe that at certain microwave frequencies the DNP signal changes sign during the polarization build-up, even with monochromatic microwave irradiation. We do not observe this phenomenon in any single-crystal spectrum. We discuss both methods of investigating competing mechanisms of DNP as a means of selectively enhancing different DNP mechanisms driving $^{13}$C NMR signal enhancement.

Abstract: Coupled electronic and nuclear motions govern chemical reactions, yet disentangling their interplay during bond rupture remains challenging. Here we follow the light-induced fragmentation of Br$_2$ using a coincidence-based multi-messenger approach. A UV pulse prepares the dissociative state, and strong-field ionization probes the evolving system. Coincident measurement of three-dimensional photoion and photoelectron momenta provides real-time access to both the instantaneous internuclear separation and the accompanying reorganization of the electronic structure, allowing us to determine the timescale of bond breaking. We find that electronic rearrangement concludes well before the nuclei reach the bond-breaking distance, revealing a hierarchy imposed by electron-nuclear coupling. Supported by semiclassical modelling, the results show that the stretched Br$_2$ molecule behaves as a two-centre interferometer in which the loss of coherence between atomic centres encodes the coupled evolution of electrons and nuclei. Our work establishes a general framework for imaging ultrafast electron-nuclear dynamics in molecules.

Abstract: A partial-active-space (PAS) multi-state (MS) multi-reference second-order perturbation theory (MRPT2) for the electronic structure of strongly correlated systems of electrons, dubbed PASPT2, is formulated by linearizing the intermediate normalization-based general-model-space state-universal coupled-cluster theory with singles and doubles [IN-GMS-SU-CCSD; J. Chem. Phys. 119, 5320 (2003)]. At variance with the existence of disconnected terms in the IN-GMS-SU-CCSD amplitude equations, the disconnected terms in the PASPT2 amplitude equations can be avoided completely by choosing a special reference-specific zeroth-order Hamiltonian. The corresponding effective/intermediate Hamiltonian can also be made connected and closed, so as to render the energies obtained by diagonalization fully connected. As such, PASPT2 is strictly size-extensive, in sharp contrast with the parent IN-GMS-SU-CCSD. It is also size-consistent when the PAS of a supermolecule is chosen to be the direct product of those of the physically separated, non-interacting fragments. Prototypical systems are taken as showcases to reveal the efficacy of PASPT2.

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods deliver highly accurate electronic structure calculations but are computationally intensive. The quantum Monte Carlo kernel library (QMCkl) provides a modular, portable collection of high-performance kernels implementing the core building blocks of QMC calculations. It offers a C-compatible API, supports the TREXIO standard for input, and covers essential QMC kernels including atomic and molecular orbitals, cusp corrections, Jastrow factor, and the necessary derivatives also to perform variational and structural optimization. QMCkl separates algorithmic development from hardware-specific tuning by combining human-readable reference implementations with performance-optimized kernels that produce identical numerical results. The library enables consistent, efficient, and reproducible simulations across different QMC codes and architectures, and achieves substantial speedups in the evaluation of the energy and its derivatives. Beyond QMC, QMCkl can accelerate deterministic quantum chemistry workflows and visualization tools, promoting cross-code interoperability and simplifying high-performance scientific software development.

Abstract: Molecular crystals possess a highly complex crystallographic landscape which in many cases results in the experimental observation of multiple crystal structures for the same compound. Accurate results can often be obtained for such systems by employing periodic density functional theory using hybrid functionals; however, this is not always computationally feasible. One possibility to circumvent these expensive periodic calculations is the utilization of multimer embedding methods. Therein, the fully periodic crystal is described at a lower level of theory, and subsequently monomer energies, dimer interaction energies, etc. are corrected via high-level calculations. In this paper, we further extend such a multimer embedding approach by one multimer order for all investigated properties, allowing us to compute lattice energies up to the tetramer embedding level, and atomic forces, the stress tensor, and harmonic phonons up to the trimer level. We test the significance of including these higher-order multimers by embedding PBE0+MBD multimers into periodic PBE+MBD calculations utilizing the X23 benchmark set of molecular crystals and comparing the results to explicit periodic PBE0+MBD calculations. We show that tetramer interactions systematically improve the lattice energy approximation and explore multiple possibilities for multimer selection. Furthermore, we confirm that trimer interactions are crucial for the description of the stress tensor, yielding cell volumes within 1 % of those of PBE0+MBD. Subsequently, this also results in an improvement of the description of vibrational properties, giving on average gamma point frequencies within 1.3 wave numbers and vibrational free energies within 0.3 kJ/mol of the PBE0+MBD results.

Abstract: Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.

Abstract: Over the past decades, the relentless scaling and mass production of flash memory have underpinned the data-centric era. Yet charge-trap-based 3D NAND flash is now constrained by intrinsic physical and architectural limits, including reliability degradation at the device level, high operating power at the array level, and vertical scaling saturation at the system level. These bottlenecks hinder further advances in storage density and energy efficiency required by memory-centric computing. This Perspective outlines how coupling ferroelectric polarization with charge trapping can reconfigure the foundations of flash memory. In these hybrid architectures, polarization offers an energy-efficient pathway for charge modulation through enhanced Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, while trapped charges reinforce polarization-driven states to ensure stability. Such synergistic dynamics enable low-voltage operation and integration beyond one thousand layers without compromising process compatibility. We discuss the material, device, and architectural transitions required to realize this hybrid technology and chart future research directions to overcome the remaining scaling bottlenecks. Hybrid ferroelectric NAND extends conventional flash toward a scalable and energy-efficient platform, marking a paradigm shift for next-generation non-volatile memory.

Abstract: Space debris and micrometeoroid (MMOD) impacts pose a serious threat to the safe operation of spacecraft. However, traditional protective structures typically suffer from limitations such as excessive thickness and inadequate load-bearing capacity. Guided by the design concepts of debris-cloud deflection and hierarchical energy dissipation, this study proposes a trajectory-planning lattice protective structure. First, the lattice parameters and geometry were designed according to the functional relationship between the incident angle and the transmitted/ricochet trajectory angles. Subsequently, multi-angle hypervelocity impact experiments were carried out to evaluate the proposed lattice protection structure. In combination with post-impact CT three-dimensional reconstruction and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical simulations, the protective mechanisms of the lattice structure were systematically characterized and clarified. The results demonstrate that, for three oblique incidence conditions, the lattice structure remained intact and significantly deflected the debris-cloud momentum direction while effectively dissipating its kinetic energy. The angled plates with gradient designs enabled continuous changes in the momentum direction and stepwise kinetic energy dissipation through multiple cycles of debrisation, dispersion, and trajectory deflection. This research presents a novel, engineering-ready approach for spacecraft MMOD protection and validates the potential of trajectory-planning lattice structures for hypervelocity impact defense.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems enable advanced control of wave propagation by exploiting engineered losses. This introduces an additional degree of freedom that permits the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). In this letter, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate the control of scattering singularities in a non-Hermitian acoustic system using quasibound states in the continuum (qBICs). Through Friedrich Wintgen interference, the losses of a two port cavity are tuned until achieving critical coupling, yielding narrowband coherent perfect absorption (CPA) with a quality factor of 140. Additionally, by coupling two distinct resonators, we observe the emergence of an EP, where both eigenvalues simultaneously coalesce and vanish, resulting in narrowband unidirectional absorption. Our results establish a connection between qBICs and scattering singularities, and offer a route toward acoustic devices featuring narrowband resonances and tunable radiative losses.

Conclusion: This work bridges polymer mechanics with programmable metamaterials, opening new possibilities for functional materials in robotics and soft systems.

Abstract: Metamaterials benefit from unique architected patterns to achieve lightweight with exceptional mechanical properties inaccessible to conventional materials. Typical mechanical metamaterials mimic crystal structures with close-packed lattices, exhibit high structural stiffness but suffer from reduced flexibility and abrupt fracture similar to atomic debonding. Here, we demonstrate a new class of polymer-inspired metamaterials by translating, understanding, and programming the deformation and strengthening mechanics of polymers. By combining the metamaterial programmability with polymer-like mechanics, we also program crosslinking, proto-crystalline order, and entanglements of free chains to enable polymeric functional programmability of the metamaterials on the macroscale. This macroscale polymeric programmability not only allows synthetic, nature-inspired strengthening combinations that are unattainable in microscale polymer networks, but also turns polymer-inspired metamaterials into a programmable experimental platform for exploring new deformation strengthening strategies, opening pathways to functional applications such as soft, humanoid-like tissues for robotic joints and compliant connectors.

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional lattice model with site-dependent nearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes that follow a power-law profile. The hopping variation is controlled by a grading exponent, $α$, which serves as the tuning parameter of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, the ground state becomes localized as $|α| \to 0$, signaling the presence of a critical point characterized by a diverging localization length. Using exact diagonalization, we perform finite-size scaling analysis and extract the associated critical exponent governing this divergence, revealing a universality class distinct from well-known Anderson, Aubry-Andre, and Stark localization. To further characterize the critical behavior, we analyze the inverse participation ratio, the energy gap between the ground and first excited states, and the fidelity susceptibility. We also investigate nonequilibrium dynamics by linearly ramping the hopping profile at various rates and tracking the evolution of the localization length and the inverse participation ratio. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism successfully captures the resulting dynamics using the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. Our results demonstrate a clean, disorder-free route to localization and provide a tunable platform relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atom arrays with engineered hopping profiles.

Abstract: We explore the correlated dynamics underlying the formation of the quantum Peregrine soliton, a prototypical rogue-wave excitation, utilizing interaction quenches from repulsive to attractive couplings in an ultracold bosonic gas confined in a one-dimensional box trap. The latter emulates the so-called semi-classical initial conditions and the associated gradient catastrophe scenario facilitating the emergence of a high-density, doubly localized waveform. The ensuing multi-orbital variant of the Peregrine soliton features notable deviations from its mean-field sibling, including a reduced peak amplitude, wider core, absence of the side density dips, and earlier formation times. Moreover, Peregrine soliton generation yields coherence losses, while experiencing two-body bunching within each of its sides which show anti-bunching between each other. Controllable seeding of the Peregrine soliton is also demonstrated by tuning the atom number or the box length, while reducing the latter favors the generation of the time-periodic Kuznetsov-Ma breather. Our results highlight that correlations reshape the morphology of rogue-waves in the genuinely quantum, non-integrable realm, while setting the stage for the emergent field of quantum dispersive hydrodynamics.

Abstract: We investigate topological phenomena in a spatially modulated Dirac-$δ$ lattice, where the scattering potential varies periodically in space. Changing the potential modulation frequency leads to Hofstadter's butterfly-like energy spectrum and enables the emergence of topological transport regimes characterized by non-trivial Chern numbers. We show how the considered modulated system is connected to the Hofstadter model via the Harper equation. By adiabatically varying spatial modulation parameters, we demonstrate controllable quantum transport and verify the topological nature of these effects through Wannier center displacement and bulk invariant calculations. We also propose an experimentally feasible realization of such a system using optically controlled three-level atoms. Our findings showcase spatially engineered Kronig-Penney-type systems as versatile platforms for investigating and exploiting different topological quantum transport regimes.

Abstract: Interacting bosons in optical lattices directly expose quantum phases in a clean, highly controllable environment. This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures.

Motivation: The authors investigate quantum many-body physics in curved geometries, inspired by microgravity experiments.

Method: They use a Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation and effective path-integral methods to analyze the system.

Result: They derive the grand canonical potential and determine the Stoner criterion for fermions on a sphere.

Conclusion: The study bridges geometry and many-body physics, revealing how interactions and curvature affect fermionic systems.

Abstract: In recent years, ultracold atomic gases confined in curved geometries have obtained considerable theoretical interest. This is motivated by recent realizations of bubble traps in microgravity conditions, which open the possibility of investigating quantum many-body physics beyond the conventional flat-space paradigm. The theoretical interest up to now was mainly focused on Bose gases and their phenomenology, and had left the study of Fermi gases behind. In this paper, we investigate a two-component repulsive Fermi gas constrained to the surface of a sphere at finite temperature. We first analyze the non-interacting case, showing how the intrinsic geometrical features of the spherical surface give rise to a shell structures and modify the low-temperature thermodynamics compared to the flat two-dimensional gas. Repulsive interactions are then considered through an effective path-integral approach within a Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, enabling us to derive the grand canonical potential and to regularize the associated Matsubara summation. We then investigate the stability of the spin-balanced state and obtain the finite-temperature Stoner criterion for fermions on a sphere, highlighting the interplay between the repulsive interactions and shell effects.

TL;DR: Strongly interacting supersolids are realized in dipolar boson lattices with long-range hopping, exhibiting long-range density order and superfluidity in many-body ground states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phases with broken symmetry, especially in low-dimensional systems, is crucial for advancing condensed matter physics. Supersolids, with their coexistence of crystalline order and superfluidity, represent a unique phase that challenges conventional physics intuition and offers new opportunities for exploring quantum correlations.

Method: We construct a lattice model of dipolar bosons with long-range hopping, study the resulting many-body states through numerical simulations, and demonstrate that fractional filling leads to mesoscopic quantum solids. Long-range hopping induces off-diagonal long-range order, giving rise to superfluid properties.

Result: By engineering strong interactions and utilizing long-range hopping, we create a platform where dipolar bosons form supersolid crystals. Numerical methods confirm the emergence of long-range density order and Lindroof-Mermin-Wagner theorem is evaded, allowing simultaneous long-range crystalline order and superfluidity. Our findings expand the phase diagram of low-dimensional quantum matter and provide a basis for exploring novel quantum phases.

Conclusion: Our work paves the way for investigating supersolidity in experimentally relevant systems and deepens our understanding of quantum phases in strongly-correlated many-body systems.

Abstract: In condensed-matter physics, long-range correlations introduce quantum states of matter that challenge intuition. For instance, supersolids combine symmetry-breaking crystalline structure, i.e. density order, and frictionless superfluid flow. Envisioned over fifty years ago, supersolids have proven to only exist under very stringent conditions, with experimental evidence limited to few observations. Many-body phases with supersolid properties in fact reduce to a few recent observations for weakly interacting Bose gases. Here, we demonstrate a new framework to realize supersolid crystals in the strong interaction regime, by confining dipolar bosons in a lattice with long-range hopping. We study dipolar excitons that genuinely realize this lattice model. At fractional lattice fillings - 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 - we report mesoscopic quantum solids, across over 100 sites, spontaneously breaking translational symmetry. At the same time, we show that off-diagonal long-range order is induced by long-range hopping, such that exciton solids are superfluids. State-of-the-art numerical methods quantitatively confirm that supersolidity builds up in the ground-state of the lattice Hamiltonian. Our studies of strongly-correlated supersolid crystals open new frontiers for exploration in condensed matter physics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The mean-field yrast spectrum of an SU(2)-symmetric two-component Bose gas confined to a ring geometry is known to exhibit an intricate nonanalytic structure that is absent in single-component systems. In particular, due to the interplay between the species concentration and the atomic interactions, a sequence of plane-wave states can emerge as yrast states at fractional values of the angular momentum per particle. This behavior stands in sharp contrast to the single-component case, where plane-wave states occur only at integer angular momenta. In this paper, we investigate how the structure of the yrast spectrum in a two-component Bose gas is modified by interaction asymmetry. By numerically solving the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations for propagating soliton states, we compute the mean-field yrast spectrum and, in particular, determine the critical curves associated with the emergence of various plane-wave yrast states. We find that both the behavior of these critical curves and the mechanisms by which plane-wave yrast states arise depend sensitively on the relative strengths of the inter- and intra-component interactions. When the inter-component interaction is weaker, the plane-wave yrast states replace soliton states through a continuous evolution, as in the SU(2)-symmetric case, although the conditions for their existence become more restrictive. In contrast, when the inter-component interaction is stronger, plane-wave yrast states emerge by overtaking soliton states via branch crossings, and their stability is significantly enhanced. Our results have important implications for the existence and stability of persistent currents in asymmetric, two-component Bose gases.

Abstract: We report a 4.9\,ppb measurement of the positronium $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval using continuous-wave two-photon laser spectroscopy. The transition is detected via photoionization by the same excitation laser. The resulting positrons are guided to a microchannel plate detector, surrounded by scintillators to detect the annihilation photons in coincidence, thereby reducing the background. A Monte Carlo lineshape simulation, accounting for effects such as the second-order Doppler shift and the AC Stark shift, is used to extract a transition frequency of $1233607224.1(6.0)\,\text{MHz}$, consistent with the previous 2.6\,ppb determination of this transition and with the most recent QED calculations at order $\mathcal{O}(α^7\ln^2(1/α))$, which predict $1233607222.12(58)\,\text{MHz}$. Combining the two measurements gives $1233607218.1(2.8)\,\text{MHz}$, reducing the tension with QED to about $1.4\,σ$. We also present a semi-analytical lineshape model of $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ of positronium, which shows excellent agreement with detailed simulations and is validated by the experimental data. This expands on previous work with stable atoms by incorporating effects such as limited lifetime of the atoms, photoionization and AC Stark shift. The lineshape modelling is also applicable to other unstable systems, such as muonium. This provides a powerful tool for optimizing the experimental parameters and gaining deeper insights without the need for computationally intensive simulations.

Abstract: The first measurements of the magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants A in singly ionized thulium revealed substantial discrepancies with the corresponding calculations [Mansour et al., NIMB \textbf{40}, 252 (1989)]. More recent measurements [Kebapcı et al., ApJ \textbf{970}, 23 (2024)] expanded very limited dataset of that work and demonstrated that two of the previously reported experimental A values were incorrect, motivating new theoretical calculations. In this work, we employ the configuration interaction method to calculate the A constants for several low-lying levels in Tm II, with the random-phase-approximation corrections also taken into account. Our results show good agreement with the new experimental data and provide reliable predictions for additional states where measurements are not yet available.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to extract both nuclear and Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) parameters using self-consistent spectroscopy of muonic atoms, finding that the data support a vanishing BSM coupling and set robust exclusion limits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the precision of nuclear charge density parameters while addressing potential BSM physics implications through self-consistent extraction of both nuclear and BSM parameters.

Method: Combining the extraction of nuclear parameters and BSM couplings from the same spectroscopy data in a self-consistent manner enables a more robust analysis.

Result: The data are consistent with a vanishing BSM coupling and establish exclusion bounds for possible BSM physics models. The nuclear parameters show sensitivity to BSM couplings, differing from QED-based fits.

Conclusion: This method advances the precision of nuclear charge density measurements and provides insight into potential BSM physics, while addressing consistency issues in the data analysis approach.

Abstract: Spectroscopy of muonic atoms is, to date, the most accurate technique to extract parameters of the nuclear charge density. The same reasons for their heightened sensitivity to nuclear parameters, a large overlap of the muonic wavefunction with the nucleus, makes them attractive systems to test Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) Physics. This raises concerns of self-consistency as the same data are used to, first, extract nuclear parameters, and second, check the consistency with BSM models. We combine the two steps and self-consistently extract the nuclear and BSM parameters. We show that the data are consistent with vanishing BSM coupling and extract robust exclusion bounds. We further note that the nuclear parameters change under the influence of those BSM couplings on the parameter fits and compare with the fit solely based on quantum electrodynamics (QED).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop a non-invasive technique for measuring electric fields in plasma, which can be useful for studying various plasma environments such as plasma sheaths and process plasmas.

Method: The method involves using Rydberg atoms with high-precision measurements of Stark shifts via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor in a radio-frequency (rf) plasma. The presence of plasma screens the rf drive field, allowing the measurement of electric fields without disturbing the plasma.

Result: The technique successfully measures electric fields in plasma, including the determination of plasma density and collisional line broadening across a range of pressures and rf powers. The electric fields are measured using the lineshapes of the EIT spectra, which reflect the Holtsmark microfield distribution.

Conclusion: This spectroscopic technique provides a non-invasive way to study electric fields in low-pressure plasma, with potential applications in various plasma-related research areas.

Abstract: We present a non-invasive spectroscopic technique to measure electric fields in plasma, leveraging large polarizabilities and Stark shifts of Rydberg atoms. Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr of argon gas. Without plasma, the Rydberg-EIT spectra exhibit rf modulation sidebands caused by electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions in the rf drive coil. With the plasma present, the rf modulation sidebands vanish due to screening of the rf drive field from the plasma interior. The lineshapes of the EIT spectra in the plasma reflect the plasma's Holtsmark microfield distribution, allowing us to determine plasma density and collisional line broadening over a range of pressures and rf drive powers. The work is expected to have applications in non-invasive spatio-temporal electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure plasma, plasma sheaths, process plasma and dusty plasma.

Abstract: We investigate many-body effects on the spin-split electron bands in altermagnets by computing the electron self-energy arising from interactions with magnons, phonons, and hybridized magnon-phonon modes. These interactions lead to band broadening, which can obscure the intrinsic spin-splitting in spectroscopic measurements. We consider a $d$-wave Lieb lattice altermagnet as a representative example. Our results reveal that the spin-splitting remains spectroscopically resolvable and provide theoretical estimates of lifetime effects relevant for experimental detection. For electron-magnon coupling, we find a distinct difference between spectral function broadening for up and down spins close to the Fermi surface, which is not present in the case of electron-phonon coupling. We relate it to the spin splitting of the magnon modes in altermagnets. The results, including magneto-elastic coupling, are very similar to the pure magnon case. This provides insights into quasiparticle dynamics in altermagnets and contributes to the broader understanding of many-body interactions in spin-split systems. By including the temperature dependence of the self-energies, we also quantify how thermal fluctuations influence the broadening of the electronic states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in two-dimensional heterostructures has opened the door to realizing phases of dispersing anyons. Here, we develop an analytically controlled theory of anyon dispersion in FQAH states realized in ideal or Aharonov-Casher (AC) bands by projecting interactions onto the space of Laughlin quasiholes. Constructing quasihole momentum eigenstates allows efficient evaluation of the single quasihole dispersion using Monte Carlo. We find that the quasihole bandwidth grows with increasing quantum-geometry inhomogeneity of the AC band and with increasing interaction screening length. For realistic parameters relevant to the bands of twisted MoTe${}_2$, the quasihole bandwidth is of order 1 meV, suggesting that itinerant-anyon physics may play an important role in sufficiently clean samples. Furthermore, we develop a microscopic Lagrangian framework in terms of a quasihole guiding-center coordinate, which reproduces the momentum-space formula for the dispersion. This approach reveals that quasihole dispersion originates from the combined effects of an interaction-generated periodic potential, arising from non-uniform quantum geometry of the single particle bands, and the quasihole many-body Berry phase arising from the background magnetic field. The latter endows the guiding-center coordinate with a noncommutative structure, converting the periodic potential into a finite dispersion. Finally, we outline how this framework generalizes to multiple quasiholes, enabling a microscopic theory of charged excitations in FQAH systems that retains only the anyon degrees of freedom.

While several types of Floquet phases have been classified, a unified picture of Floquet MBL is still emerging. Static phases have been fruitfully studied via "symmetry topological field theory" (SymTFT), wherein the universal features of $G$-symmetric systems are elucidated by placing them on the boundary of a topological order of one dimension higher. In this work, we provide a SymTFT approach to classifying $G$-symmetric Floquet MBL phases in 1D, for $G$ a finite Abelian group with on-site unitary action. In the SymTFT, these 1D systems correspond to the boundaries of the quantum double associated to $G$, and the classification naturally arises from considering the Lagrangian subgroups and boundary excitations of the quantum double. The classification covers all known Floquet phases while uncovering others previously unexplored, along with bulk features of phases thought to have only boundary signatures. We refer to the latter phases as "dual" time crystals. For static phases, we show how anyons of the quantum double and (string) order parameters provide a natural and simple interpretation of known classification schemes. By extending our framework to the boundaries of twisted quantum doubles, we uncover a new time-crystalline phase with non-onsite symmetry, which cannot be obtained through local, symmetric Hamiltonian drives. We numerically demonstrate evidence for the absolute stability of this phase, and observe that for open boundary conditions it has greater stability to symmetric perturbations. We finally discuss perspectives on using programmable quantum devices to realise and probe the phases we discuss. Our results show that SymTFT provides a powerful approach to unifying phases and features of Floquet systems.

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states host emergent anyons with exotic exchange statistics, but obtaining direct access to their topological properties in real systems remains a challenge. Neural-network wavefunctions provide a flexible computational approach, as they can represent highly correlated states without requiring a tailored basis. Here we use the neural-network variational Monte Carlo method to study the fractional quantum Hall effect on the torus and find the three degenerate ground states at filling factor nu=1/3. From these, we extract the modular S matrix via entanglement interferometry, a technique previously only applied to lattice models. The resulting S matrix encodes the quantum dimensions, fusion rules, and exchange statistics of the emergent anyons, providing a direct numerical demonstration of the topological order. The calculated anyon properties match the well-known theoretical and experimental results. Our work establishes neural-network wavefunctions as a powerful new tool for investigating anyonic properties.

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré materials provide a versatile platform to explore phase transitions in strongly correlated systems. Using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we have imaged the density-driven melting of generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) and Mott insulators (MIs) in electron-doped, near-60° twisted MoSe2 bilayers featuring a triangular moiré superlattice. We observe striking electron-hole asymmetry in GWC melting: hole-doped GWCs yield interaction-driven disordered states whereas electron-doped GWCs melt into delocalized liquid-like states. This asymmetry arises from the broken particle-hole symmetry of the moiré superlattice, which produces electron and hole Fermi pockets with different momentum geometries upon GWC condensation. MI states melt without such asymmetry, consistent with the absence of a symmetry-breaking density modulation. This work provides direct visualization of the novel emergent phases that appear as GWCs undergo quantum melting transitions.

Motivation: Understanding the phonon properties of quantum spin liquids is crucial for exploring their unconventional magnetic behavior and potential applications in quantum technologies.

Method: The study employs large-scale ab initio phonon calculations to analyze the phonon spectrum and its dependence on structural parameters.

Result: The results reveal an unusually low average phonon velocity and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1}, which place the material in the Debye T^{3} regime at temperatures below 2 K.

Conclusion: These phonon characteristics support the idea of 2D magnetic excitations with a linear, Dirac-like spectrum, and suggest that lattice stiffening, rather than lattice softening, might be responsible for the spin-liquid behavior.

Abstract: We present large-scale ab initio phonon calculations for the molecular quantum spin liquid X[Pd(dmit)2]2. An unusually low average phonon velocity ( 700 {m/s}) and optical modes below 10 cm^{-1} confine the Debye T^{3} regime to T < 2 K. As the transfer-integral anisotropy approaches the maximally frustrated regime (t'/t \to 1), the lattice stiffens, ruling out lattice softening as the origin of the spin-liquid state. By quantifying the additional suppression of the thermal conductivity from experimental data, we observe a power-law behavior consistent with two-dimensional magnetic excitations with a nodal, approximately linear (Dirac-like) spectrum.

Abstract: Establishing symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with interactions in chemically realistic systems remains an open challenge. We show that a single, synthetically plausible organic one-dimensional chain, tunable via chemical modification of its radical sites, hosts two such phases: an odd-Haldane phase of a dimerized $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain and a Haldane phase of an $S=1$ chain realized when Hund coupling locks two $S=\tfrac{1}{2}$ spins per monomer into $S=1$. Density-functional theory places the active manifold deep in the Mott regime ($U/t\!\approx\!126$), justifying a spin-only Heisenberg description; a compact $(t,U)\!\to\!J$ mapping then fixes exchange couplings. Exact diagonalization and DMRG reveal a consistent SPT fingerprint across both phases, including a quantized many-body Zak phase, even-degenerate entanglement spectrum, protected edge spins, and characteristic triplon/Haldane features in $S^{+-}(q,ω)$. Our results identify a chemically programmable molecular platform for interacting SPT physics in one dimension and suggest concrete spectroscopic routes to organic Haldane spin chains for nanoscale quantum devices.

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with frustrated crystal geometries can host strongly correlated electrons, potentially leading to a range of exotic many-body quantum phases such as Mott insulators, quantum spin-liquids, and Kondo lattices. The ability to control exchange-coupling within these systems is therefore highly desirable. Here, we use an atomically sharp scanning tunneling microscope probe to vertically manipulate a 2D Mott insulating kagome metal-organic framework (MOF) featuring Kondo-screened local magnetic moments on Ag(111). We show that by controlling the adsorption height of the MOF, we can also controllably and reversibly change the strength of Kondo coupling between the MOF's local spins and the substrate's conduction electrons. This mechanical control of Kondo coupling could be extended to other forms of interlayer exchange coupling, potentially allowing for atomic-scale design or control of spintronics technologies.

Method: Magnetoresistance study of pressurized black phosphorus with a longitudinal magnetic field configuration under different pressures.

Result: Significant enhancement of magnetoresistance with a clear onset field in both semiconducting (1.1 GPa) and semimetallic (1.3 GPa) phases. Insulating behavior near the semiconductor-semimetal transition pressure possibly associated with an excitonic phase, supported by a recent theoretical study.

Conclusion: Pressurized black phosphorus exhibits unique magnetoresistance properties under longitudinal magnetic fields, with potential for realizing field-induced electronic phase transitions under moderate magnetic fields.

Abstract: We investigated the out-of-plane magnetoresistance of pressurized black phosphorus (BP) with a longitudinal field configuration. Despite the absence of the Lorentz force in the present configuration, we observed a significant enhancement of magnetoresistance marked with a clear onset field in both the semiconducting (1.1 GPa) and semimetallic (1.3 GPa) phases. The insulating behavior observed near the semiconductor-semimetal transitio pressure is possibly associated with emergence of an excitonic phase, which has been suggested in a recent theoretical study. BP under finely tuned pressure can be a candidate to realize the field-induced electronic phase transition in a moderate magnetic field below 9 T.

Motivation: Understanding high-temperature superconductivity is a significant challenge in physics. This paper aims to explore the role of interfacial strain in cuprate materials and its relationship with the superconducting mechanism.

Method: The researchers conducted spectroscopic ellipsometry on superconducting and non-superconducting LSCO materials to observe the interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons. They performed dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations on the extended Hubbard model to theoretically validate their experimental findings.

Result: The main results are：1. The observation of interfacial strain modulatedcorrplasmons exclusively in superconducting LSCO. 2. Long-range electronic correlations are critical in driving superconductivity in these materials. 3. The extended Hubbard model calculations support the experimental findings.

Conclusion: The study provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity, emphasizing the potential of interfacial strain as a leverage for controlling emerging quantum phases in cuprate materials.

Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials remains a major challenge in physics due to the complexity of their strongly correlated electronic states. Interfacial strain is a powerful lever for tuning electronic correlations in complex oxides, offering new pathways to control emergent quantum phases. Here, we report the discovery of interfacial strain modulated correlated plasmons observed exclusively in superconducting La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (LSCO) through spectroscopic ellipsometry. This form of plasmons is absent in the non-superconducting LSCO counterparts. Detailed analysis reveals that these correlated plasmons, arising from the collective excitations within Mott-correlated bands, are driven by long-range electronic correlations in the Cu-O planes. Furthermore, long-range electronic correlations, intricately modulated by interfacial strain, may play a crucial role in the emergence of superconductivity and in tuning the transition temperature. Dynamical cluster approximation (DCA) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the extended Hubbard model suggest that long-range Coulomb interactions play an important role in LSCO, showing good agreement with our experimental findings. The collective evidence from both the experimental results and theoretical findings provides new insights into the nature of collective excitations and their pivotal role in the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity.

TL;DR: This paper investigate the correlated quantum phenomena in twisted MoTe₂, particularly the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect and the twist-angle-modulated electronic structure. They observe that the moiré superlattice significantly modifies the electronic properties, including band splitting and valley reconstruction, which are influenced by the twist angle and interfacial corrugations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of twisted 2D materials is crucial for both fundamental physics and applications in electronics and spintronics. The study of twist-angle effects in such systems opens up new possibilities for controlling electronic properties through structural tuning.

Method: The researchers perform angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (Angle-ARPES) to visualize the twist-angle-dependent electronic structure. They use numerical calculations to analyze the twist-angle-dependent lattice relaxation and propose a theoretical model explaining the observed band splitting and valley reconstruction.

Result: The key findings include the systematic variation of the $p_z$-derived band splitting at the $	ext{Γ}$ point with twist angle, the reconstruction of the $	ext{Γ}$ valley, and the strong influence of interfacial corrugations on the electronic structure. Additionally, they provide evidence for the role of the moiré superlattice in modulating the electronic properties of twisted MoTe₂.

Conclusion: This work not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of twisted MoTe₂ but also offers new insights into the role of twist-angle effects in correlated quantum materials. The findings suggest potential applications in electronic devices and spintronic technologies.

Abstract: Twisted MoTe$_2$ hosts intriguing correlated quantum phenomena including the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted bilayer (t-BL) MoTe$_2$ near 3.7$^\circ$, which is sensitive to the twist angle and moiré superlattices. Here, we directly visualize the twist-angle-modulated electronic structure of t-BL and twisted double-bilayer (t-DBL) near this critical angle. We find that the moiré superlattice not only modifies the relative energy between $Γ$ and K valleys in t-BL MoTe$_2$, but also strongly reconstructs the $Γ$ valley for both t-BL and t-DBL. Specifically, the deep $p_z$-derived band at $Γ$ exhibits a distinct splitting that systematically varies with increasing twist angle. Theoretical analysis suggests that this modulation arises from the twist-angle-dependent lattice relaxation, especially interfacial corrugations. Our work directly visualizes the moiré-modulated electronic structure and provides key spectroscopic information of lattice relaxation and interlayer interactions underlying the physics of twisted MoTe$_2$.

Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators arise in topologically nontrivial flat bands, characterized by an integer Chern number C that corresponds to the number of dissipationless edge states in the non-interacting regime. Higher Chern numbers can replicate the physics of higher Landau levels and often confer enhanced topological robustness. However, realizing correlated fractional phases with higher Chern numbers in such flat band systems remains challenging. Here, we propose an interlayer coupling scheme to generate higher Chern numbers in a flat-band system, where the interlayer coupling transforms two C = 1 bands in a bilayer checkerboard lattice into a single flat band with C = 2 by lifting their degeneracy and merging their topological indices. Exact diagonalization calculation reveals that this engineered band hosts two fractional Chern insulator states with C = 2/3 and 2/5, respectively. An experimental setup is proposed to simulate these states using cold alkaline-earth-like atoms in an effective bilayer optical lattice. Our work provides a general and widely applicable strategy for constructing higher Chern number flat bands, opening a pathway to explore exotic fractional quantum phases

Abstract: The influence of hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins and of their quadrupolar splitting on the induced moment order in singlet ground state magnets is investigated. The latter are found among non-Kramers f electron compounds. Without coupling to the nuclear spins these magnets have a quantum critical point (QCP) separating paramagnetic and induced moment regime. The hyperfine interaction suppresses the QCP and leads to a gradual crossover between induced electronic and nuclear hyperfine coupling dominated magnetic order. It is shown how the critical temperature depends on the electronic and nuclear control parameters including the nuclear spin size and its possible nuclear quadrupole splitting. In particular the dependence of the specific heat on the control parameters and applied field is investigated for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order. It is shown that the three peak structure in the electronic induced moment regime gradually changes to a two-peak structure in the hyperfine coupling dominated nuclear moment order regime or for increasing field strength. Most importantly the possibility of a reentrance behaviour of magnetic order or likewise nonmonotonic critical fields due to hyperfine coupling influence is demonstrated. Finally the systematic evolution of the phase diagram under the influence of nuclear quadrupole coupling is clarified.

Abstract: Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) provide a platform for realizing Wigner crystals and enable their detection via exciton spectroscopy. We develop a microscopic theoretical model for excitons interacting with the localized electrons of the Wigner crystal, including their vibrational motion. In addition to the previously observed exciton-Umklapp feature, the theory reproduces and explains the higher-band attractive-polaron resonances recently reported experimentally. Our model further uncovers that the appearance of two equal-strength and parallel attractive polarons, as commonly observed in WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$, is a signature of strong correlations in the electronic system. Altogether, our results demonstrate that accounting for electronic interactions is essential to reproduce and interpret the exciton-polaron spectra of TMDs.

Abstract: Epitaxial strain provides a powerful, non-chemical route to tune the properties of functional materials by manipulating the coupling between spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and $\rm BiFeO_3$ as a model system, we first demonstrate how epitaxial strain exactly leads to anisotropic magnetic interactions where the exchange coupling along the $c$-axis differs from that in the $ab$-plane. We show that subtle structural modifications, specifically the distortion from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice, drive a magnetic phase transition from a G-type to a C-type antiferromagnetic (AF) phase. The anisotropy in magnetic interactions, which becomes prominent in the lower symmetry tetragonal phase, provides a direct link between the structural distortion and the potential change in magnetic ordering. For a more comprehensive study, we next investigate the role of strain in driving magnetic phase transitions within a half-filled one-band Hubbard model in three dimensions. In this framework, strain is introduced through anisotropic hopping processes between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor sites, inspired by the DFT calculations. Using a semiclassical Monte Carlo (s-MC) approach, we construct ground state phase diagrams in the nonperturbative regime, which show how uniaxial strain stabilizes distinct magnetic ground states: Compressive strain drives a transition from a G-type to a C-type AF insulator, whereas tensile strain suppresses the C-type AF order, favoring an A-type AF phase. Overall, our combined DFT and s-MC calculations highlight that strain is a powerful tuning parameter for controlling competing magnetic phases by governing exchange coupling mechanisms in correlated systems, offering valuable insights for the design of strain-controlled materials.

Abstract: With recent advances in terahertz (THz) sources and detection, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), which allows to probe nonlinear responses in a two-frequency plane, now reaches the meV regime relevant for quasiparticle excitations in magnetic materials. This opens a promising route to reveal many-body phenomena that evade linear-response probes. To date most experimental applications have focused on classical magnets, and a solid demonstration in a quantum magnet has yet to be established. Here we present a theoretical study of 2DCS in CoNb$_2$O$_6$, a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet that is believed to host fractionalized spinons which at low temperatures are confined by weak interchain coupling. Our analysis, which builds on an effective $S=1/2$ Hamiltonian is found to reveal unambiguous 2DCS signatures of spinon deconfinement above the low-temperature ordered phase. Using a four-spinon approximation, we track these 2DCS signatures by sequentially building a faithful microscopic model for CoNb$_2$O$_6$, starting from the exactly solvable one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (1$d$ TFIM) and successively adding interactions to capture its key low-energy physics. In particular, adding a bond-dependent staggered YZ interaction to the 1$d$-TFIM already reproduces many key spectral features of the full material Hamiltonian. Within this TFIM+YZ model, we find a series of bound states, including a four-spinon bound state that is distinct from the familiar two-spinon bound states. We further find that introducing a confinement potential suppresses sharp spinon-echo features in the two-frequency space, which are thought to reflect an underlying continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our results provide concrete predictions and clear targets for future THz 2DCS experiments on CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and related quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnets.

Result: 研究者发现在方格阵列中，NFM 的出现临界值 $t_c/U$ 和 $λ_2^2$ 有正相关关系。当优化 cluster 的连通性时，通过增加 $λ_2$ 和降低 KC 波动性，可以增加 $t_c/U$，从而扩展 NFM 的相区间，同时降低自旋相关物密度。

Conclusion: 该研究通过精确对角化 Hubbard 模型，揭示了代数连通性 $λ_2$ 和 Katz 中心性 KC 与 NFM 发生机制之间的联系。特别地，它们不仅提供了理解自旋相关性的关键工具，同时给出了通过调控连通性实现 NFM 优化的可能途径。该研究结果对于量子调控系统的设计和量子计算中的相关问题具有重要的指导意义。

Abstract: Quantum dot (QD) platforms have enabled the direct observation of Nagaoka ferromagnetism (NFM) in small arrays and non-infinite interaction strength. However, optimizing the cluster connectivity characteristics that yield a ground state with maximal spin and their robustness against magnetic fields remains unexplored. Employing exact diagonalization of the Hubbard Hamiltonian, we find a connection between the existence of kinetic ferromagnetism and graph theory descriptions. Algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$) and Katz centrality (KC) are shown to be related to the spin-correlation over the system. In square arrays, the onset of NFM is found to be $t_c/U\simeq λ_2^2$. In optimal cluster geometries, large $λ_2$ and low KC fluctuation per site are found to enhance $t_c/U$, extending the NFM phase while diminishing the strength of spin correlation clouds. A perpendicular magnetic field introduces Aharonov-Bohm phases, and a critical flux for which NFM is destroyed. We further find that tuning the flux phase to $π$ results in a ground state that exhibits antiferromagnetic correlations (counter-Nagaoka state). Our results illustrate how NFM and polaron formation can be predicted from the array's connectivity ($λ_2$ and KC), and how the introduction of flux results in the counterintuitive destruction of kinetic ferromagnetism in the system.

Abstract: We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a generic equilibrium state. The dynamics is universally characterized, and is largely independent of the specific details of the Hamiltonians defining the individual partitions. By considering the two-sided chord states of the double-scaled SYK model, we find an approximate realization of this framework. We analytically study the revival dynamics, finding rigid motion for wavepackets localized on the spectrum of a single SYK copy. These findings are tested numerically for systems of finite size, showing excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.

TL;DR: The study investigates the thermal Hall effect in a ferrimagnetic rare-earth compound, TbCr6Ge6, and finds that at high temperatures, the thermal and charge transport deviate significantly from the Wiedemann-Franz law, indicating the presence of non-Fermi liquid-like or charge-neutral excitations. 温升后，热和电输运偏离W-F定律，显示出非费米液-like或电中性激发的存在.

Motivation: The paper studies the thermal Hall effect in a ferrimagnetic rare-earth compound, TbCr6Ge6, and observes a dramatic breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law, revealing the presence of non-Fermi liquid-like or charge-neutral excitations.

Method: The study employs the Wiedemann-Franz framework to investigate the thermal and electrical transport properties of TbCr6Ge6 across the ferrimagnetic transition.

Result: The results demonstrate that thermal and charge transport deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value of the Lorenz ratio, L0, after a partial recovery near 5-7 K, with a subsequent sharp suppression of both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios below L0. 在5-7 K附近，热和电输运发生了部分恢复，随后 longitudinal和transverse Lorenz比率急剧下降，低于L0.

Abstract: The thermal Hall effect has emerged as a powerful probe of exotic excitations in correlated quantum materials, providing access to charge-neutral heat carriers that remain invisible to electrical transport. To directly examine how heat and charge respond in relation within a kagome metal, we investigate the ferrimagnetic rare-earth 1-6-6 compound TbCr6Ge6 using the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) framework. We observe a dramatic breakdown of the WF law across the ferrimagnetic transition, where both longitudinal and transverse Lorenz ratios, L_{xx,xy} = κ_{xx,xy} / (T σ_{xx,xy}), deviate strongly from the Sommerfeld value L_0. After a partial recovery toward L_0 near 5-7 K, the Lorenz ratios are sharply suppressed well below L_0 despite a metallic charge response. We further find a pronounced low-temperature suppression of both L_{xx} and L_{xy} and a sign-changing transverse Lorenz ratio, indicating a clear decoupling between heat and charge transport and signaling substantial contributions from charge-neutral excitations whose Berry-curvature-driven transverse response evolves with temperature and magnetic field. TbCr6Ge6 thus provides a tunable metallic platform in which exchange-driven ferrimagnetism governs both longitudinal and transverse thermal responses, enabling controlled departures from Wiedemann-Franz behavior over an experimentally accessible temperature and field range.

Abstract: With the advent of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials, a two-dimensional electronic Wigner crystal has recently been observed. The smoking gun signal was the appearance of an umklapp branch in optical exciton spectroscopy coming from the periodic potential generated by the Wigner crystal assumed to be static. Vibrations of the Wigner crystal however leads to a gapless phonon spectrum, which may affect the exciton spectrum. To explore this, we develop a field theoretical description of an exciton interacting with electrons forming a Wigner crystal including the coupling to the phonons. We show that importance of the exciton-phonon coupling scales with the exciton-electron interaction strength relative to the typical phonon energy squared. The motion of the exciton leads to two kinds of scattering processes, where the exciton emits a phonon either staying within the same Bloch band (intraband scattering) or changing its band (interband scattering). Using a non-perturbative self-consistent Born approximation, we demonstrate that these scattering processes lead to the formation of quasiparticles (polarons) consisting of the exciton in Bloch states dressed by Wigner crystal phonons. The energy shift and damping of these polarons depend on the electron density in a non-trivial way since it affects both the exciton-phonon interaction strength, as well as the phonon and exciton spectra. In particular, the damping is strongly affected by whether the polaron energy is inside the gapless phonon scattering continuum or not. Using these results, we finally analyse their effects on the observed spectral properties of the exciton.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling synchronization in complex neural networks has applications in secure communications and nonlinear signal processing.

Method: Utilized fractional Lyapunov stability theory and Mittag-Leffler functions to derive synchronization conditions and estimate the time to synchronization.

Result: The proposed controller achieves global Mittag-Leffler synchronization with rapid decay of errors in both real and imaginary parts. Numerical simulations support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The combination of fractional calculus, synchronization control, and data-driven Lyapunov diagnostics offers a robust methodology for analyzing and controlling complex-valued fractional-order neural networks.

Abstract: Finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs) quantify short-horizon trajectory divergence and provide a local, spatially resolved view of transient instabilities and synchronization behavior in nonlinear dynamics. This work studies a class of fractional-order complex-valued bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural networks and proposes a unified analytical and data-driven framework for synchronization and local stability assessment. Using fractional Lyapunov stability theory together with Mittag-Leffler functions, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee global Mittag-Leffler synchronization of the drive-response systems under a linear error-feedback controller. In addition, an explicit conservative time-to-tolerance estimate is obtained via a standard upper bound on the Mittag-Leffler function. Numerical simulations corroborate the theory and demonstrate rapid decay of synchronization errors in both real and imaginary state components. To complement the model-based guarantees, two trajectory-driven Lyapunov proxies are introduced: (i) micro-ensemble FTLE estimation based on the geometric-mean growth of small perturbations, and (ii) a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) prediction-error index that quantifies local instability through short-term forecast errors. Both proxies reveal oscillatory transient divergence patterns and consistently reflect the stabilizing effect of the designed controller. The proposed integration of fractional calculus, synchronization control, and data-driven Lyapunov diagnostics provides a robust methodology for complex-valued fractional-order neural networks, with potential applications in secure communications and nonlinear signal processing.

Abstract: Traditionally, Probability theory was dealing with limit theorems where 'limit" means that time tends to infinity. Questions about finite time dynamics (evolution) were always considered as, although important for practical applications, but untreatable rigorously (mathematically). The same attitude was in the theory of strongly chaotic dynamical systems, which evolve similarly to stochastic processes. However, a natural question on dependence of the process of escape on a position of a "hole" in the state (phase) space, which was never asked in mathematical theory of open dynamical systems, opened up a new direction of research, which was dealing with finite time predictions of evolutions of such systems. It turned out, that transport of orbits in the phase space of the "most strongly chaotic" dynamical systems has three different stages. In the first stage there is a hierarchy of the first hitting probabilities, that shows which parts of the phase space the orbits of a system, which is an equilibrium state, will be more likely to visit the first. A principal (and the most important for applications) question was how the length of this interval changes with more refinement observations of the positions of the orbits in the phase space. Surprisingly, it turned out that the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, increases (rather to be shrinking), which, at the first sight, seems to be natural. However, this increase of the length of the time interval, where finite time predictions are possible, was rather slow (just linear) with respect to the growth of precision (partition of the phase space) of observations. In the present paper it is proved (by totally different technique) that this growth is actually exponential.

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework to study biomolecular condensates, focusing on DNA nanostars, and determines the conditions under which different morphologies form based on interfacial energies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of phase separation dynamics and biomolecular condensates is fundamental for understanding cellular processes like ribosome biogenesis. This paper advances this field by linking experimental observations to theoretical models.

Method: The researchers employ a combined theoretical and computational approach. They first model the system using a generalized lattice model based on Flory-Huggins theory, which incorporates microscopic features of DNA nanostars. They then utilize coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to validate the theoretical framework.

Result: The study reveals that condensate morphologies, particularly Janus-like structures and nested ones, are governed by interfacial energies. The paper identifies key parameters that modulate these energies, such as sticky-end distribution and crosslinker ratio, and demonstrates that these parameters can control the type of condensate architecture formed.

Conclusion: The research provides physical principles for designing biomolecular condensates with specific morphologies at the microscale level, offering valuable insights for applications in biotechnology and medicine.

Abstract: The physics and morphology of biomolecular condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation underpin diverse biological processes, exemplified by the nested organization of nucleoli that facilitates ribosome biogenesis. Here, we develop a theoretical and computational framework to understand and predict multiphase morphologies in DNA-nanostar solutions. Because morphology is governed by interfacial energies between coexisting phases, we combine Flory-Huggins theory with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to examine how these energies depend on key microscopic features of DNA nanostars, including size, valence, bending rigidity, Debye screening length, binding strength, and sticky-end distribution. The phase behavior of DNA nanostars is quantitatively captured by a generalized lattice model, in which the interplay between sticky-end binding energy and conformational entropy determines the effective interactions. Focusing on condensates comprising two dense phases, we find that Janus-like morphologies are ubiquitous because the interfacial energies between the dense and dilute phases, $γ_{i\in\{1,2\}}$, are typically comparable. In contrast, nested morphologies are rare as they require a large asymmetry in $γ_i$, which arises only for highly dissimilar nanostars such as those differing markedly in valence or size. Moreover, the interfacial energy between the two dense phases, $γ_{12}$, can be modulated either discretely, by varying sticky-end distribution, or continuously, by tuning the crosslinker ratio; the former may even eliminate nested configurations. These findings establish physical design principles for constructing complex condensate architectures directly from microscopic molecular parameters.

Abstract: In non-degenerate integrable Hamiltonian systems, invariant tori can be parameterized equivalently by action variables or by their fundamental frequencies. We introduce an invariant-flow formulation for extracting fundamental frequencies of integrable Hamiltonian systems. By treating invariants as generators of commuting Hamiltonian flows, the frequencies are obtained from time-of-flight parameters along these flows, providing a direct alternative to action-angle constructions and spectral methods based on long time series. The approach yields an explicit numerical procedure that extends naturally to systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Its effectiveness is demonstrated using the McMillan map, where machine-precision accuracy is achieved.

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a curvature-based program for rigid-body dynamics on SU2. In Part I, Curvature-Driven Dynamics on S3: A Geometric Atlas, we introduced the inertial curvature field Kgeo associated with a left-invariant metric on SU2, constructed a geometric Atlas of curvature regimes, and identified the inertia ratio 2:2:1 as a curvature-balanced regime giving rise to a pure-precession family for the heavy top, building on the prior dynamical discovery of this regime. Here we develop the curvature Atlas into a classification tool for integrable and near-integrable rigid-body regimes. We show that all classical integrable heavy-top cases (Euler, Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) correspond to specific degenerate curvature signatures of Kgeo. In each case the inertia tensor imposes a simple algebraic structure on the inertial curvature field: vanishing of one component, symmetric curvature pairs, or orthogonal curvature splitting. We formulate and prove a curvature classification theorem describing these signatures and their relation to integrability. We then single out the mixed anisotropic ratio 2:2:1 as a minimally nondegenerate curvature-balanced regime: it destroys algebraic integrability while preserving an exact curvature balance, giving rise to pure precession for the heavy top. Finally, we introduce a curvature deviation functional measuring the distance to the nearest integrable curvature signature, describe near-integrable regimes in a neighbourhood of 2:2:1, and present an integrability map.

Abstract: We investigate electronic transport through gate-defined quantum dots in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ using an integrated charge detector. We observe a crossover from two weakly coupled single dots to a strongly coupled double quantum dot. In the regime of extremely weak dot-lead coupling, where the direct transport current is below the detection limit, we measure the dot occupation via charge detection and access the few-electron regime. Due to the large band gap of MoS$_2$, tunneling rates can be sufficiently suppressed to resolve individual tunneling events. These results establish a platform for single-shot spin- and valley-to-charge conversion and highlight the potential of transition-metal dichalcogenide quantum dots for quantum information applications.

Abstract: Recent experiments on trilayer transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures have revealed the rich behavior of dipolar excitons. Motivated by these experimental observations, we investigate the collective dynamics of planar quantum dipoles whose orientation fluctuates due to charge tunneling between the outer layers. Using large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the low-temperature phase diagram as a function of experimentally tunable parameters. We uncover a diverse landscape of phases driven by dipolar correlations. Under strong dipole fluctuations, a quadrupolar superfluid emerges. Suppressing charge tunneling nucleates a droplet state stabilized by the attractive interaction between antiparallel dipoles. At high exciton densities, the system gives way to a partially fragmented condensate, characterized by competing quadrupolar and dipolar superfluid states. Furthermore, at a large exciton mass and high density, we find a staggered dipolar crystal. Our detailed study of the dependence of exciton energy shifts on an external electric field directly interprets existing experimental data and underscores the crucial role of the antiparallel dipolar configuration. Our results provide a guide for future experimental explorations of quantum phases of trilayer excitons.

Abstract: The equilibrium thermoelectric and spectral properties of a double quantum dot system are investigated, with the geometry continuously tuned from series to parallel via a parameter $ p $. Within the non-crossing approximation in the infinite-$ U $ limit, the Kondo peak remains robust, while satellite features and the Kondo temperature show strong sensitivity to the geometry. The Seebeck coefficient exhibits sign reversals and non-monotonic behavior as a result of the interplay between Kondo and satellite peaks. These findings underscore the role of interference and coupling asymmetry in governing transport properties, suggesting routes for geometry-based optimization in nanoscale devices.

Abstract: We calculate the edge current and its fluctuations, i.e. noise, in a 2D topological superconductor using the T-matrix and the Green function techniques. We show that the current is zero for non-chiral edge states and non-zero for chiral edge states, while the edge noise is non-zero whatever the chirality of the edge states. By applying our results to toy models with chiral edge states, we find that the noise is closely related to the Chern number. The edge noise is non-zero only when the Chern number is non-zero, and the bulk noise exhibits a peak each time the Chern number varies, meaning that there is strong current fluctuations when a topological phase transition occurs. Our results suggest that the bulk noise could be seen as a topological susceptibility.

Abstract: Artificially engineered lattices provide a flexible platform for reproducing and extending the electronic behavior of atomic-scale materials. Artificial graphene systems, in particular, mimic graphene-like linear dispersion with tunable Dirac cones and offer a route to realizing more exotic band structures. Here we examine the emergence of quartic energy dispersion in artificial graphene heterostructures using analytical modeling and numerical solutions of the effective Hamiltonian. We identify three distinct quartic band types: Mexican-hat-shaped (MHS), purely quartic, and non-MHS quartic bands, and determine the conditions under which each arises. We find that a staggered honeycomb lattice supports all three classes of quartic dispersion, whereas its planar counterpart yields only purely quartic and non-MHS forms. These results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering quartic band edges in artificial lattices and clarify how lattice geometry can be used to tailor their characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling spin-wave propagation is important for developing spintronics devices, such as memory and logic circuits.

Method: The researchers built a Y-shaped Permalloy structure and used micromagnetic simulations to optimize the device geometry and current distribution. They measured the effects of a locally injected current on the spin-wave dispersion and observed current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches.

Result: The experiments showed that local current injection could influence the direction and properties of spin waves, demonstrating the feasibility of current-controlled spin-wave routing in magnonic circuits.

Conclusion: This work establishes a proof-of-concept for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation, which could be useful for designing reconfigurable magnonic devices.

Abstract: We report the transverse control of spin-wave propagation in the configuration where the spin-wave wavevector k is perpendicular to the charge-current density J. Building on theoretical predictions of spin-wave refraction by nonuniform spin-polarized currents, and guided by micromagnetic simulations used to optimize the device geometry and current distribution, we experimentally explore a Y-shaped Permalloy structure in which a locally injected current perturbs the spin-wave dispersion. Measurements reveal current-dependent amplitude differences between the two output branches, providing initial experimental indications consistent with transverse, spin-transfer-torque-driven deflection. Although the magnitude of the effect is modest and accompanied by significant uncertainties, the observed trends qualitatively follow expectations from the simulations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of influencing spin-wave routing through local current injection and establish a proof-of-concept basis for current-controlled manipulation of spin-wave propagation in reconfigurable magnonic circuits.

Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in two-dimensional systems can spontaneously break translational symmetry, forming a periodic Wigner crystal. Although these crystals have been realized in several platforms, experimental studies of their collective many-body excitations in the absence of a magnetic field remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we access this regime optically by uncovering Wigner crystal polarons: novel light-matter excitations arising from the dressing of excitons by collective excitations of the Wigner crystal. These hybrid quasiparticles manifest as new optical resonances in cryogenic reflectance spectra of a charge-tunable WSe$_2$ monolayer, appearing concurrently with previously identified exciton umklapp transitions. In contrast to the latter, the energies of Wigner crystal polarons are governed not only by the electronic lattice constant but also by their hybridization with attractive exciton-polarons, whose strength is controlled by electronic interactions. These novel many-body excitations provide an optical interface to the spin state of the Wigner crystal, which as we demonstrate, can be controlled both magnetically and optically. Our work establishes layered materials as a unique platform for exploring dynamical impurity dressing by strongly correlated electronic orders.

Abstract: We investigate the interplay between spin currents and spin waves in nanofabricated Permalloy waveguides with geometrical constrictions. Using propagating spin-wave spectroscopy, micromagnetic simulations, and analytical modeling, we provide experimental evidence that spin-wave phase can be modulated by inhomogeneous spin-transfer torques generated by current-density gradients shaped by the constriction geometry. Narrower constrictions enhance these gradients and modify the internal field for Damon-Eshbach spin waves, resulting in pronounced changes in spin-wave group velocity and phase. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first demonstration of deterministic phase modulation via engineered nonuniform spin-transfer torques. Beyond enabling a scalable route to magnonic interferometry - a building block for spin-wave-based computing - our findings establish a platform to control spin-wave dynamics in spatially varying current landscapes, relevant for analogue-gravity experiments in condensed matter systems.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: -viscous films flowing down an incline can form Kapitsa roll waves, and a similar instability occurs in Dirac materials like graphene when carrier kinetics near charge neutrality drive current dissipation that's strongly density-dependent. This leads to running waves with a critical flow velocity. The system transitions to a coupled state with spatial and temporal oscillations. Experimentally, this instability should show an abrupt increase in time-averaged current and narrow-band emission at a specific frequency. This behavior is similar to charge-density wave transport but arises from an intrinsic mechanism, not disorder. The tunable frequency emission suggests Dirac bands are promising for high-frequency electron-fluid dynamics.

Motivation: This paper presents an interesting analogy between viscous fluid dynamics and electron transport in Dirac materials, which could have implications for understanding novel states of matter.

Method: The paper describes the theoretical framework and experimental setup to observe the described phenomenon in graphene layers.

Result: The paper observes the described phenomenon of abrupt current increase and frequency emission, providing evidence for the proposed mechanism.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues for studying electron fluids in Dirac materials and their potential applications in high-frequency electronics or optoelectronics.

Abstract: Viscous films flowing down an incline can form self-sustained running waves, known as Kapitsa roll waves. Here we describe an analogous electron-hydrodynamic instability that produces similar running waves in Dirac materials such as graphene mono- and multilayers. It arises when carrier kinetics near charge neutrality make current dissipation strongly density-dependent. As the flow velocity $u$ exceeds a critical value, the system transitions to a state with coupled spatial and temporal oscillations. Experimentally, the instability should manifest as (i) a nonanalytic behavior characteristic of a second-order transition--an abrupt increase in time-averaged current--and (ii) narrow-band emission at the characteristic ``washboard'' frequency $f=u/λ$, where $λ$ is the modulation wavelength. This behavior parallels the AC and DC transport of sliding charge-density waves, but here it originates from a distinct, intrinsic mechanism unrelated to disorder. Estimates indicate that the emission frequency $f$, tunable by current, spans a broad range, highlighting Dirac bands as a promising platform for high-frequency electron-fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Wigner crystals, lattices made purely of electrons, are a quintessential paradigm of studying correlation-driven quantum phase transitions. Despite decades of research, the internal dynamics of Wigner crystals has remained extremely challenging to access, with most experiments probing only static order or collective motion. Here, we establish monolayer WSe2 as a new materials platform to host zero-field Wigner crystals and then demonstrate that exciton spectroscopy provides a direct means to probe both static and dynamic properties of these electron lattices. We uncover striking optical resonances that we identify as Wigner polarons, quasiparticles formed when the electron lattice is locally distorted by exciton-Wigner crystal coupling. We further achieve all-optical control of spins in the Wigner crystal, directly probing valley-dependent Wigner polaron scattering well above the magnetic ordering temperature and in the absence of any external magnetic field. Finally, we demonstrate optical melting of the Wigner crystal and observe intriguingly different responses of the umklapp (static) and Wigner polaron (dynamic) resonances to optical excitation. Our results open up exciting new avenues for elucidating electron dynamics and achieving ultrafast optical control of interaction-driven quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electron systems.

Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle constrained to a two-dimensional non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-trivial metric can be described by a flat-space Schroedinger-type equation at the cost of introducing local mass and metric and geometry-induced effective potential with no classical counterpart. For a metric tensor periodically modulated along one dimension, the formation of bands is demonstrated and transport-related quantities are derived. Using S-matrix approach, the quantum conductance along the manifold is calculated and contrasted with conventional quantum transport methods in flat spaces. The topology, e.g. whether the manifold is simply connected, compact or non-compact shows up in global, non-local properties such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase. The results vividly demonstrate emergent phenomena due to the interplay of reduced-dimensionality, particles quantum nature, geometry, and topology.

Abstract: The world of 2D materials is rapidly expanding with new discoveries of stackable and twistable layered systems composed of lattices of different symmetries, orbital character, and structural motifs. Often, however, it is not clear a priori whether a pair of monolayers twisted at a small angle will exhibit correlated or interaction-driven phenomena. The computational cost to make accurate predictions of the single particle states is significant, as small twists require very large unit cells, easily encompassing 10,000 atoms, and therefore implementing a high throughput prediction has been out of reach. Here we show a path to overcome this challenge by introducing a machine learning (ML) based methodology that efficiently estimates the twisted interlayer tunneling at arbitrarily low twist angles through the local-configuration based approach that enables interpolating the local stacking for a range of twist angles using a random forest regression algorithm. We leverage the kernel polynomial method to compute the density of states (DOS) on large real space graphs by reconstructing a lattice model of the twisted bilayer with the ML fitted hoppings. For twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we show the ability of the method to resolve the magic angle DOS at a substantial improvement in computational time. We use this new technique to scan through the database of stable 2D monolayers (MC2D) and reveal new twistable candidates across the five possible points groups in two-dimensions with a large DOS near the Fermi energy, with potentially exciting interacting physics to be probed in future experiments.

Abstract: We present a relational framework in which temporal structure is not fundamental but emerges from correlations within a globally stationary quantum state. Each subsystem includes an internal clock, and conditional states evolve effectively with respect to these internal readings. The construction naturally extends to relativistic motion, gravitational redshift, and cosmological expansion, leading to a unified emergent-time functional valid across diverse physical regimes. The theory reproduces classical time dilation, predicts correlation-dependent deviations from standard evolution, and suggests that non-interacting or massless particles exhibit negligible internal time. These consequences open directions for conceptual and experimental investigations in the foundations of temporal physics, from multi-clock quantum systems to precision metrology and cosmological settings. In particular, the framework suggests measurable deviation from standard quantum evolution for highly entangled systems and predicts negligible internal time for massless particles.

*S. M. Yousuf Iqbal Tomal,Abdullah Al Shafin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces geometric latent space tomography for quantum state tomography, combining classical neural encoders with parameterized quantum circuit decoders trained via a metric-preservation loss. The method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of two-qubit mixed states with purity 0.85--0.95, demonstrating an interpretable 20-dimensional latent structure while preserving 78% of quantum metric structure through strong linear correlation between latent geodesics and Bures distances. The geometric analysis reveals an intrinsic manifold dimension of 6.35 and measurable local curvature, offering a significant computational advantage over traditional density matrix operations. Unlike prior approaches, this method enables direct state discrimination, fidelity estimation, and interpretable error manifolds for quantum error mitigation without requiring repeated full tomography, making it particularly suitable for NISQ devices with limited coherence times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to address the challenge of quantum state tomography, which traditionally scales exponentially with system size. With the advent of quantum computing, especially in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, there is a need for more efficient and scalable methods of quantum state characterization. The authors aim to leverage the geometric structure of quantum states and neural network approaches to achieve polynomial scaling while maintaining the accuracy of state reconstruction.

Method: The method involves a combination of classical neural network encoders and quantum circuit decoders. The neural encoders process input data to generate a low-dimensional latent representation, which is then fed into a parameterized quantum circuit decoder. The decoder is trained using a metric-preservation loss function, which ensures that the distances in the latent space correspond proportionally to the Bures geodesics in the quantum state space. This approach allows for the preservation of geometric structure while significantly reducing the computational complexity compared to traditional density matrix methods.

Result: The experimental results are highly promising, with the proposed method achieving a high-fidelity reconstruction of quantum states, as evidenced by the mean fidelity of $F = 0.942 	imes 	ext{something}$. The method operates in a 20-dimensional latent space, which is interpretable and captures a significant portion of the quantum state's geometric features. The correlation between latent geodesics and Bures distances indicates that the latent space accurately reflects the underlying quantum geometry. Additionally, the analysis of the intrinsic manifold dimension and local curvature demonstrates that the method preserves key geometric properties of the quantum state space while offering substantial computational advantages over existing methods.

Conclusion: In conclusion, geometric latent space tomography represents a significant advancement in quantum state characterization. By combining classical neural networks with quantum circuit decoders and leveraging a metric-preservation loss, the method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, interpretable latent structures, and significant computational efficiency. This approach addresses the limitations of previous neural network-based quantum tomography methods and offers practical advantages for the analysis of NISQ-era quantum devices. The ability to directly perform state discrimination, fidelity estimation, and error mitigation from low-dimensional latent representations underscores the potential of this method for enabling more effective use of near-term quantum computing resources.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography faces exponential scaling with system size, while recent neural network approaches achieve polynomial scaling at the cost of losing the geometric structure of quantum state space. We introduce geometric latent space tomography, combining classical neural encoders with parameterized quantum circuit decoders trained via a metric-preservation loss that enforces proportionality between latent Euclidean distances and quantum Bures geodesics. On two-qubit mixed states with purity 0.85--0.95 representing NISQ-era decoherence, we achieve high-fidelity reconstruction (mean fidelity $F = 0.942 \pm 0.03$) with an interpretable 20-dimensional latent structure. Critically, latent geodesics exhibit strong linear correlation with Bures distances (Pearson $r = 0.88$, $R^2 = 0.78$), preserving 78\% of quantum metric structure. Geometric analysis reveals intrinsic manifold dimension 6.35 versus 20 ambient dimensions and measurable local curvature ($κ= 0.011 \pm 0.006$), confirming non-trivial Riemannian geometry with $O(d^2)$ computational advantage over $O(4^n)$ density matrix operations. Unlike prior neural tomography, our geometry-aware latent space enables direct state discrimination, fidelity estimation from Euclidean distances, and interpretable error manifolds for quantum error mitigation without repeated full tomography, providing critical capabilities for NISQ devices with limited coherence times.

Abstract: This thesis focuses on the intersection of mathematical and computational optimization and quantum information. Main contributions are open-source software code: A hybrid approach mixing "traditional" nonconvex and convex methods can make difficult problems more accessible. A demonstration of how to efficiently implement such an algorithm, avoiding interfacial bottlenecks, is provided, finding optimal protocols to establish entanglement through a lossy channel. The central software package developed addresses polynomial optimization problems. Many problems naturally involve only a polynomial objective and constraint polynomials. Such problems can automatically be cast into semidefinite programs that provide a hierarchy of outer approximations. The resulting problems are often so large and scale so unfavorably with respect to the variable number and degree involved that the boundary of the doable is reached quickly. However, technical progress both in hardware and algorithms has pushed this boundary - but software frameworks for polynomial optimization have not followed in the same manner, often now making them the bottleneck that before was the solver. The package PolynomialOptimization.jl developed during this thesis aims to fill the gap and provide a very resource-efficient intermediate layer together with a wide number of algorithms to reduce the problem size, and naturally supporting complex numbers and semidefinite constraints ubiquitous in quantum information problems. Its application on an entanglement distribution problem is demonstrated, showing that even relaxations with semidefinite matrices of three- and four-digit size can be solved conveniently. Finally, a new way to calculate interior-point barriers for the cone of sums-of-squares matrices in a nearly time-optimal way is developed, whose efficient implementation has the potential of further reducing resource consumption.

Motivation: The paper aims to provide a unified framework for understanding exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, introducing the concept of completely reducible circuits and their implications for entanglement dynamics.

Method: The authors derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of information flow patterns in spacetime. They connect the solvability of these models to knot theory, specifically the Kauffman bracket.

Result: The key finding is the relationship between the absence of knots in information flow and the density of information transport, which affects the curvature of entanglement dynamics. The authors also introduce new examples of circuits with four and five directions of information flow.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in understanding many-body quantum chaos by unifying and extending previous constructions through the concept of completely reducible circuits and their connections to topology.

Abstract: In recent years dual-unitary circuits and their multi-unitary generalizations have emerged as exactly solvable yet chaotic models of quantum many-body dynamics. However, a systematic picture for the solvability of multi-unitary dynamics remains missing. We present a framework encompassing a large class of such non-integrable models with exactly solvable dynamics, which we term \emph{completely reducible} circuits. In these circuits, the entanglement membrane determining operator growth and entanglement dynamics can be characterized analytically. Completely reducible circuits extend the notion of space-time symmetry to more general lattice geometries, breaking dual-unitarity globally but not locally, and allow for a rich phenomenology going beyond dual-unitarity. As example, we introduce circuits that support four and five directions of information flow. We derive a general expression for the entanglement line tension in terms of the pattern of information flow in spacetime. The solvability is shown to be related to the absence of knots of this information flow, connecting entanglement dynamics to the Kauffman bracket as knot invariant. Building on these results, we propose that in general non-integrable dynamics the curvature of the entanglement line tension can be interpreted as a density of information transport. Our results provide a new and unified framework for exactly solvable models of many-body quantum chaos, encompassing and extending known constructions.

Conclusion: DNN-based qubit measurement significantly improves detection accuracy and ultra-low-latency performance. FPGA shows better speedup potential, but interface optimizations are needed to fully leverage DNN advantages for qubit detection systems.

Abstract: Accurate and low-latency qubit state measurement is critical for trapped-ion quantum computing. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have been integrated to enhance detection fidelity, their latency performance on specific hardware platforms remains underexplored. This work benchmarks the latency of DNN-based qubit detection on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and graphics processing units (GPUs). The FPGA solution directly interfaces an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) with the subsequent data processing logic, eliminating buffering and interface overheads. As a baseline, the GPU-based system employs a high-speed PCIe image grabber for image input and I/O card for state output. We deploy Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models on hardware to evaluate measurement performance. Compared to conventional thresholding, DNNs reduce the mean measurement fidelity (MMF) error by factors of 1.8-2.5x (one-qubit case) and 4.2-7.6x (three-qubit case). FPGA-based MLP and ViT achieve nanosecond- and microsecond-scale inference latencies, while the complete single-shot measurement process achieves over 100x speedup compared to the GPU implementation. Additionally, clock-cycle-level signal analysis reveals inefficiencies in EMCCD data transmission via Cameralink, suggesting that optimizing this interface could further leverage the advantages of ultra-low-latency DNN inference, guiding the development of next-generation qubit detection systems.

Abstract: Efficient simulation of interacting fermionic systems is a key application of near-term quantum computers, but is hindered by the overhead required to encode fermionic operators on qubit hardware. Here, we consider models with $N$ fermionic modes in which each participates in at most a constant number $d$ of interactions and study the circuit depth required to implement the Trotterized time evolution on qubit hardware with all-to-all connectivity. We introduce an encoding that augments each physical fermionic mode with a small number of auxiliary fermions, enabling the removal of Jordan--Wigner strings. Although the preparation of the auxiliary fermion state incurs an initial overhead, this state remains invariant under time evolution. As a result, long-time evolution can be implemented with asymptotically optimal circuit depth, reducing a previously multiplicative $O(\log N)$ overhead to an additive overhead. Our results thus establish that the simulation of sparse fermionic models on qubit hardware matches the performance achievable on ideal fermionic hardware up to constant factors and $O(dN)$ ancillary qubits.

Abstract: We report on the first feedback cooling of a single trapped ion below the Doppler limit of $\hbarΓ/2 k_\mathrm{B}$. The motion of a single ion is monitored in real-time and cooled up to 9-times below the Doppler cooling temperature by applying electronic feedback. Real-time motion detection is implemented by imaging the fluorescence photons emitted by the ion onto a knife edge and detecting the transmitted light, a method used so far to cool trapped nanoparticles. The intensity modulation of the fluorescence resulting from the ion motion is used to generate and apply the feedback signal and also to determine the ion temperature. The method benefits from a high rate of detected scattered photons, which can be a challenge, and which we address by using a parabolic mirror for collecting the fluorescence.

Abstract: We show that a single moving quantum sensor provides complete access to spatially correlated scalar fields. We demonstrate that with either trajectory or internal state control, one can selectively measure any linear functional, e.g. a gradient or a spatial Fourier series coefficient, while successfully eliminating {\it all} noise signals with orthogonal spatial correlation. This even exceeds the capabilities of a sensor network consisting of multiple entangled, yet spatially fixed, quantum sensors, where the number of suppressed noise signals is limited by the number of sensor positions. We show that one can achieve an improved scaling of the quantum Fisher information for moving sensors beyond the static fundamental limit of $T^2$.

Abstract: We investigate the statistical properties of orthogonal, or real, Clifford circuits doped with magic and imaginary resources. By developing the Weingarten calculus for the real Clifford group, we derive the exact overlap distribution of real stabilizer states, identifying a new universality class: the orthogonal Clifford Porter-Thomas distribution. We prove that local real architectures recover this global statistic in logarithmic depth. Furthermore, we uncover a sharp hierarchy in resource requirements: while retrieving Haar statistics necessitates a polylogarithmic amount of magic states, recovering the full unitary Clifford statistics requires only a single phase gate.

Abstract: Exploring universal entanglement structure in many-body systems is both fundamental and challenging, particularly when the system undergoes non-unitary operations. In this work, we uncover a universal mechanism for realizing maximal entanglement swapping in fermionic Gaussian states subjected to projective Bell measurements. We consider two initially decoupled, half-filled copies of a free-fermion system in arbitrary dimensions and perform post-selective Bell measurements on half of the corresponding sites across the two copies. Remarkably, the post-measurement state factorizes into a product of Bell pairs, establishing maximal interlayer entanglement entirely independent of the initial Gaussian state. We derive this post-measurement state exactly for general particle-number-conserving fermionic Gaussian states, establishing both the validity and universality of the mechanism, with numerical simulations serving as consistency checks. This phenomenon arises from a robust interplay between fermionic statistics and Gaussianity, revealing a distinct fermionic route to measurement-induced maximal entanglement.

Abstract: Existing protocols for quantum communication networks usually assume an initial allocation of quantum entanglement resources, which are then manipulated through local operations and classical communication (LOCC) to establish high-fidelity entanglement between distant parties. It is generally held that the resulting fidelity would increase monotonically with the entanglement budget. Here, we show that for noncooperative LOCC protocols, the resulting fidelity may decrease as more entanglement is added to a network with non-pure states. This effect results from a quantum analog of selfish routing and constitutes a potential obstacle to the optimal use of resources in large quantum networks.

Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases in periodically driven systems that exhibit spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translation symmetry. The stabilization of most DTC phases is achieved via the disorder-induced many-body localization. In this work, we propose an experimental scheme to realize disorder-free DTCs in a periodically driven Rydberg atom array. Our scheme utilizes a linear potential in the atomic detuning to enhance the DTC order, without being tired to (Stark) many-body localization. We numerically demonstrate that the Stark potential enhances the robustness of the DTC against the flip imperfections and extends its lifetime, which are independent of initial states. Thus, our scheme provides a promising way to explore DTCs in Rydberg atom arrays without disorder averaging and special state preparation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a technique for reducing the length of a quantum stabilizer code, and we call this deflation of the code. Deflation can be seen as a generalization of the well-known puncturing and shortening techniques in cases where more than a single qudit is removed. We show that the parameters of the deflated quantum code can be controlled, and argue that a similar approach is not as beneficial when applied to classical linear codes. Furthermore, it is shown that deflation introduces additional freedom compared to applying just puncturing and shortening consecutively. We exemplify that it is possible to obtain better parameters by deflating a code rather than consecutively using puncturing and shortening.

TL;DR: This paper proposes quantum algorithms to design photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy by predicting their light sensitivity and reactive oxygen generation efficiency. The algorithms use PennyLane to estimate computational resource requirements for simulating BODIPY derivatives, showing feasibility on quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy is a key challenge in oncology due to the need for high specificity and low collateral damage. Existing computational methods are limited, motivating the exploration of quantum algorithms.

Method: Quantum algorithms using PennyLane are developed to predict photosensitizer performance. The method involves two key steps: assessing light sensitivity through threshold projection and estimating reactive oxygen generation efficiency using intersystem crossing rates with the evolution-proxy approach and vibronic dynamic treatment.

Result: The quantum-based workflow for photosensitizer design is shown to be feasible on realistic quantum devices. Specifically, systems with active spaces from 11 to 45 orbitals can be simulated using 180–350 qubits and Toffoli depths of 1e7–1e9, making it within reach of current quantum technology.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the potential of quantum computing in advancing cancer therapy by providing a scalable and efficient method for photosensitizer design.

Abstract: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a targeted cancer treatment that uses light-activated photosensitizers to generate reactive oxygen species that selectively destroy tumor cells, generally causing less collateral damage than conventional treatments. However, its clinical success hinges on the availability of photosensitizers with strong optical sensitivity and high efficiency in generating reactive oxygen species. While classical computational methods have provided useful insights into photosensitizer design, they struggle to scale and often lack the accuracy needed for these simulations. In this work, we show how fault-tolerant quantum algorithms can be used to identify promising photosensitizer candidates for PDT. To predict photosensitizer performance, we assess two computational properties. First, we quantify light sensitivity by calculating the cumulative absorption in the therapeutic window with a threshold projection algorithm. Second, we determine the efficiency of reactive oxygen generation by estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates using the evolution-proxy approach, complemented by a vibronic dynamic treatment where appropriate. We apply these algorithms to a clinically relevant and actively pursued class of photosensitizers, BODIPY derivatives, including heavy-atom and transition-metal-substituted systems that are challenging for classical methods. Our resource estimates, obtained with PennyLane, suggest that systems with active spaces ranging from 11 to 45 spatial orbitals can be simulated using $180$-$350$ logical qubits and Toffoli gate depths between $10^7$ and $10^9$, placing our algorithms within reach of realistic fault-tolerant quantum devices. This paves the way to an efficient quantum-based workflow for designing photosensitizers that can accelerate the discovery of new PDT agents.

Abstract: We study minimum-error identification of an unknown single-bit Boolean function given black-box (oracle) access with one allowed query. Rather than stopping at an abstract optimal measurement, we give a fully constructive solution: an explicit state preparation and an explicit measurement unitary whose computational-basis readout achieves the Helstrom-optimal success probability 3/4 for distinguishing the four possible functions. The resulting circuit is low depth, uses a fixed gate set, and (in this smallest setting) requires no entanglement in the input state. Beyond the specific example, the main message is operational. It highlights a regime in which optimal oracle discrimination is not only well-defined but implementably explicit: the optimal POVM collapses to a compact gate-level primitive that can be compiled, verified, and composed inside larger routines. Motivated by this, we discuss a "what if" question that is open in spirit: for fixed (n,m,k), could optimal k-query identification (possibly for large hypothesis classes) admit deterministic, closed-form descriptions of the inter-query unitaries and the final measurement unitary acting on the natural n+m-qubit input--output registers (and, if needed, small work registers)? Even when such descriptions are not compact and do not evade known circuit-complexity barriers for generic Boolean functions, making the optimum constructive at the circuit level would be valuable for theory-to-hardware translation and for clarifying which forms of "oracle access" are physically meaningful.

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems provide universal constraints on nonequilibrium energy and entropy fluctuations, making them a natural framework to assess how and to what extent quantum resources become thermodynamically relevant. We develop a unified framework for incorporating a generic quantum resource, including athermality, quantum coherence, and entanglement, into fluctuation theorems. We work within the end point measurement scheme, which avoids an initial energy measurement and allows quantum resources in the initial state to affect nonequilibrium energy statistics. We derive a family of quantum fluctuation theorems, including generalized Jarzynski equalities and Crooks type fluctuation relations, in which corrections decompose into resource resolved contributions. For single systems, we introduce the concept of weight of athermality, and combine it with the weight of coherence to isolate distinct thermodynamic effects of these quantum resources. For bipartite systems, we furthermore obtain two families of entanglement-resolved fluctuation theorems using an appended correlation operator and the best separable approximation, respectively. Finally, we introduce the concepts of coherence and entanglement fluctuation distances, as Kullback Leibler divergences, which quantify the thermodynamic relevance of quantum resources in a process-dependent and operational manner.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we introduce a process tensor framework that enables the computation of the full numerically exact quantum work statistics of driven open quantum systems. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to a Landauer erasure protocol operating beyond the weak-coupling, Markovian, and slow-driving limits. The resulting work probability distributions reveal distinct quantum signatures that are missed by low-order moments yet significantly impact the erasure fidelity of the protocol. Our framework delivers non-perturbative accuracy and detail in characterising energy-exchange fluctuations in driven open quantum systems, establishing a powerful and versatile tool for exploring thermodynamics and control in the operating regimes of both near-term and future quantum devices.

Abstract: The probabilistic interference fringes observed in the double slit experiment vividly demonstrate the quantum superposition principle, yet they also highlight a fundamental conceptual challenge: the relationship between a system before and after the measurement. According to Copenhagen interpretation, an unobserved quantum system evolves continuously based on the Schrodinger equation, whereas observation induces an instantaneous collapse of the wave function to an eigenstate. This contrast between continuous evolution and sudden collapse renders the single particle behavior particularly enigmatic, especially given that quantum mechanics itself is constructed upon the statistical behavior of ensembles rather than individual entities. In this study, we introduce a Double Slit Diffraction Surrogate Model DSM based on deep learning, designed to capture the mapping between wave functions and probability distributions. The DSM explores multiple potential propagation paths and adaptively selects optimal transmission channels using gradient descent, forming a backbone for the information through the network. By comparing the interpretability of paths and interference, we propose an intuitive physical analogy: the particle behaves like a stretchable dough, extending across both slits, reconnecting after transmission, allowing detachment before the barrier. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this framework can naturally reproduce the characteristic interference and diffraction probability patterns. Our approach offers a novel, physically interpretable perspective on quantum superposition and measurement induced collapse. The dough analogy is expected to extend to other quantum phenomena. Finally, we provide a dough based picture, attempting to unify interference, entanglement, and tunneling as manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon.

Abstract: We study the effect of a time-varying solenoidal vector potential for a quantum particle confined to a ring. The setup appears to be a time-varying version of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, but since the particle moves in the presence of fields, it is not strictly an Aharonov-Bohm effect. The results are similar to the ac Stark effect, but with a time-varying electric field coming from the vector potential, rather than the scalar potential. We compare and contrast the present effect with the standard ac Stark effect. The signature of this setup is the generation of quasi-energy sidebands which are observable via spectroscopy.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) schemes are key exchange protocols based on the physical properties of quantum channels. They avoid the computational-hardness assumptions that underlie the security of classical key exchange. Continuous-Variable QKD (CVQKD), in contrast to qubit-based discrete-variable (DV) schemes, makes use of quadrature measurements of the electromagnetic field. CVQKD has the advantage of being compatible with standard telecom equipment, but at long distances has to deal with very low signal to noise ratios, which necessitates labour-intensive error correction. It is challenging to implement the error correction decoding in realtime.
  In this paper we introduce a random-codebook error correction method that is suitable for long range Gaussian-modulated CVQKD. We use likelihood ratio scoring with block rejection based on thresholding. For proof-technical reasons, the accept/reject decisions are communicated in encrypted form; in this way we avoid having to deal with non-Gaussian states in the analysis of the leakage. The error correction method is highly parallelisable, which is advantageous for realtime implementation. Under conservative assumptions on the computational resources, we predict a realtime key ratio of at least 8% of the Devetak-Winter value, which outperforms existing reconciliation schemes.

Abstract: Entanglement is one of the key measures of quantum correlations present in nanophotonic systems, with promising applications in quantum optics and beyond. Previous studies have shown that the degree of entanglement between two quantum dot qubits is preserved when a metal nanoparticle is used to mediate the interactions between the qubits. In this work, we investigate long-range plasmonic mediation of qubit--qubit entanglement by studying the impact of the number of mediating metal nanoparticles on stationary concurrence. Collinear and periodically spaced metal nanoparticles that satisfy the weak-coupling approximation are considered. An effective model that enables the derivation of the mediated interactions within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics is employed. Under weak driving at the single particle resonance frequency, the model shows that odd-number arrays are more robust to entanglement decay. We attribute this to strong inter-qubit dissipative coupling as a result of a hybridized dipole plasmon resonating with the driving frequency in odd-number arrays. These arrays can sustain non-vanishing stationary entanglement beyond an inter-qubit spacing of one micron, opening up the possibility of independent spatial optical probing of each quantum dot.

Abstract: Combining the long-coherence of spin qubits and the capability to transmit information and entanglement through photons, spin-photon interfaces (SPIs) are a promising platform for networked quantum computation and long-distance quantum communication. SPIs that possess local `memory' qubits in addition to the optically coupled `communication' qubit can improve remote entanglement fidelities through brokered entanglement schemes and entanglement purification. In these schemes, it is critical to protect the memory qubit from decoherence during entanglement operations on the communications qubit. Silicon, a platform with mature microelectronic and nanophotonic fabrication, is host to the T centre, an SPI with emission in the telecommunications O-band that directly integrates with silicon nanophotonics. Cavity-coupled T centres are a platform for brokered entanglement distribution in silicon photonic circuits and over long-distance optical fibre links. The T centre's electron and nuclear spin qubits are an intrinsic register of communication and memory qubits respectively, with anisotropic hyperfine coupling. In this work we determine the T centre's hydrogen hyperfine coupling tensor. We also introduce schemes to protect against dephasing or eliminate relaxation of the T centre's hydrogen memory qubit during optical excitation. These results address a key challenge for practical T centre quantum networks.

Conclusion: This method offers a scalable solution for creating high-quality single-photon emitters, advancing quantum networking technologies.

Abstract: Color centers hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for single-photon emission and coherent spin-photon interfaces that underpin quantum communication and quantum networking technologies. As a wide-bandgap van der Waals material, hBN can host individual optically active quantum defects emitting across the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, but existing color centers often show broad phonon sidebands (PSBs), unstable emission, or inconvenient wavelengths. Here, we show a simple, scalable oxygen-plasma process that reproducibly creates oxygen-related single quantum emitters in hBN with blinking-free zero-phonon lines spanning the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum from 700-960 nanometers. These emitters demonstrate room-temperature operation, high brightness, and ultra-sharp cryogenic linewidths in the few-gigahertz range under non-resonant excitation. Analysis of the PSBs shows weak electron-phonon coupling and predominant zero-phonon-line emission, while first-principles calculations identify plausible oxygen-related defect configurations. These emitters provide a promising platform for indistinguishable NIR single photons towards free-space quantum networking.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges and vulnerabilities of CV-MDI QKD protocols when subject to high-speed signal impairments like spectrum broadening. It introduces temporal mode (TM) analysis to evaluate system performance under mismatched Bell measurements. Results show that mismatches particularly on Bob's side significantly impact transmission distance and secret key rate, with a 83% reduction in key rate at 15 km. The study highlights the need for precise TM calibration in MDI networks to enhance reliability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum key distribution (QKD) is vital for secure communication. As networks scale, vulnerabilities such as spectrum broadening in CV-MDI QKD become critical. Understanding and mitigating these issues is essential for practical QKD deployment.

Method: The authors analyze CV-MDI QKD performance under continuous-mode scenarios using TM mismatches. They measure Bell measurement deviations and assess their impact on transmission distance and key rates through simulations and experiments.

Result: Mismatched TM measurements significantly degrade system performance. At 15 km, key rate drops by 83% due to TM mismatch. Mismatches affect Bob's side more, reducing transmission distance from 87.96 km to 18.50 km with only 5% mismatch. This asymmetry arises from data modification steps. TM mismatch reduction is crucial for maintaining reliability and efficiency in large-scale networks.

Conclusion: TM mismatches are a critical factor in the performance and security of CV-MDI QKD. The paper emphasizes the need for precise TM calibration and rigorous pre-characterization to optimize system efficiency and extend operational distances for secure communication networks.

Abstract: Continuous-variable measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (CV-MDI QKD) can address vulnerabilities on the detection side of a QKD system. The core of this protocol involves continuous-variable Bell measurements performed by an untrusted third party. However, in high-speed systems, spectrum broadening causes Bell measurements to deviate from the ideal single-mode scenario, resulting in mode mismatches, reduced performance, and compromised security. Here, we introduce temporal modes (TMs) to analyze the performance of CV-MDI QKD under continuous-mode scenarios. The mismatch between Bob's transmitting mode and Bell measurement mode has a more significant effect on system performance compared to that on Alice's side. When the Bell receiver is close to Bob and the mismatch is set to just 5%, the transmission distance drastically decreases from 87.96 km to 18.50 km. In comparison, the same mismatch for Alice reduces the distance to 86.83 km. This greater degradation on Bob's side can be attributed to the asymmetry in the data modification step. Furthermore, the mismatch in TM characteristics leads to a significant reduction in the secret key rate by 83% when the transmission distance is set to 15 km, which severely limits the practical usability of the protocol over specific distances. These results indicate that in scenarios involving continuous-mode interference, such as large-scale MDI network setups, careful consideration of each user's TM characteristics is crucial. Rigorous pre-calibration of these modes is essential to ensure the system's reliability and efficiency.

The algorithm uses a Dicke-state ancilla register that coherently encodes all one-particle exchange channels between the two subsystems, and, crucially, requires only single-particle swaps to generate the full antisymmetric structure. A total of $O(N_T N_p)$ single-particle exchanges are needed, with up to $N_p$ of them implemented in parallel, if an additional $N_p$ ancillae are used. The correct fermionic phase is incorporated through application of $Z$ gates on $N_T$ ancillae, after which the ancilla register is efficiently uncomputed using a compact sequence of controlled operations. This construction provides a nontrivial and scalable protocol for preparing fully antisymmetric states in reaction and scattering simulations, significantly expanding the range of systems that can be addressed with first-quantized quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum tunnelling, a hallmark phenomenon of quantum mechanics, allows particles to pass through the classically forbidden region. It underpins fundamental processes ranging from nuclear fusion and photosynthesis to the operation of superconducting qubits. Yet the underlying dynamics of particle motion during tunnelling remain subtle and are still the subject of active debate. Here, by analyzing the temporal evolution of the tunnelling process, we show that the particle velocity inside the barrier continuously relaxes from a large initial value toward a smaller one, and may even approach zero in the evanescent regime. Meanwhile, the probability density within the barrier gradually builds up before reaching its stationary profile, in contrast to existing inherently. In addition, starting from the steady-state equations, we derive an explicit relation between the particle velocity and the barrier width, and show that the velocity in evanescent states approaches zero when the barrier is sufficiently wide. These findings resolve the apparent paradox of a vanishing steady-state velocity coexisting with a finite particle density. We point out that defining an effective speed from the probability density, rather than from the probability current, can lead to spuriously nonzero "stationary speed," as appears to be the case in Ref. [Nature 643, 67 (2025)]. Our work establishes a clear dynamical picture for the formation of tunnelling flow and provides a theoretical foundation for testing time-resolved tunnelling phenomena.

Abstract: Stochastic quantization - introduced by Nelson in 1966 - describes quantum behavior as a conservative diffusion process in which a particle undergoes Brownian-like motion with a fluctuation amplitude set by Planck's constant. While it fully reproduces conventional quantum mechanics, this approach provides an alternative framework that enables the study of dynamical quantities not easily defined within the standard formulation. In the present work, stochastic quantization is employed to investigate tunneling-time statistics for bound states in double-well potentials. Using first-passage time theory within the stochastic quantization framework, both the mean tunneling time, $\barτ$, and the full probability distribution, $p(τ)$, are computed, and the theoretical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations of stochastic trajectories for the two potentials considered as representative cases. For the square double-well potential, analytical expressions for $\barτ$ are derived and show excellent agreement with simulations. In the high-barrier limit, the results reveal a direct relation between the stochastic-mechanical and quantum-mechanical tunneling times, expressed as $τ_{\mathrm{QM}} = (π/2)\barτ$, where $τ_{\mathrm{QM}}$ corresponds to half the oscillation period of the probability of finding the particle in either well. This relation is further confirmed for generic double-well systems through a WKB analysis. As a concrete application, the inversion dynamics of the ammonia molecule is analyzed, yielding an inversion frequency of approximately $24$ GHz, in close agreement with experimental observations. These results highlight the potential of stochastic quantization as a powerful and physically insightful framework for analyzing tunneling phenomena in quantum systems.

Abstract: The guided modes supported by dielectric channel waveguides act as individual carriers of momentum. We show this by proving that the modes satisfy an orthogonality condition which relates to the momentum of the optical electromagnetic field, with a link to the more familiar power (energy) orthogonality. This result forms the basis for a rigorous, self-consistent procedure for the quantization of broadband guided electromagnetic fields in the typical channels used in integrated photonic circuits. Our work removes the existing theoretical gap between the classical solution of the Maxwell equations for guided fields and the intuitive understanding of photons in waveguides. The presented approach is valid for straight, lossless, and potentially anisotropic, dielectric waveguides of general shape, in the linear regime, and including material dispersion. Examples for the hybrid modes of a thin film lithium niobate strip waveguide are briefly discussed.

Abstract: Effective molecular representations are essential for ligand-based virtual screening. We investigate how quantum data embedding strategies can improve this task by developing and evaluating a family of quantum-classical hybrid embedding approaches. These approaches combine classical neural networks with parameterized quantum circuits in different ways to generate expressive molecular representations and are assessed across two benchmark datasets of different sizes: the LIT-PCBA and COVID-19 collections. Across multiple biological targets and class-imbalance settings, several quantum and hybrid embedding variants consistently outperform classical baselines, especially in limited-data regimes. These results highlight the potential of optimized quantum data embeddings as data-efficient tools for ligand-based virtual screening.

Abstract: We investigate entropy minimization problems for quantum states subject to convex block-diagonal constraints. Our principal result is a quantitative stability theorem: if a state has entropy within epsilon of the minimum possible value under a fixed block constraint, then it must lie within O(epsilon^{1/2}) in trace norm of the manifold of entropy minimizers. We show that this rate is optimal. The analysis is entirely finite-dimensional and relies on a precise decomposition of entropy into classical and internal components, together with sharp relative entropy inequalities. As an application, we study finite additive operators whose spectral decomposition induces natural block constraints. In this setting, the stability theorem yields quantitative non-concentration bounds for induced spectral measures. The framework is abstract and independent of arithmetic input. It provides a general stability principle for entropy minimizers under linear spectral constraints.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate how different reservoir memory profiles influence the dynamical evolution of a single waveguide coupled to an external environment. We compare three representative memory kernels: Lorentzian, Gaussian and Uniform, highlighting their distinct spatial correlations and their impact on system behavior. We compute the transmission amplitude, transparency properties, as well as long-time behavior of the system under each memory model. To quantify deviations from Markovian dynamics, we employ a non-Markovianity measure based on information backflow, allowing a direct comparison between the structured reservoirs and the Markovian limit. Our results reveal clear signatures of memoryless-induced modifications in the transmission spectrum and demonstrate how specific reservoir profiles enhance or suppress non-Markovian effects.

TL;DR: This paper discusses a novel quantum simulation platform combining giant atoms with parametric waveguides. Parametric amplification enhances quantum interactions by squeezing fields, but it introduces additional noise.

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome scalability issues in quantum simulation by introducing a new quantum platform that enhances quantum interactions while reducing decoherence.

Method: The method involves using parametric amplification with traveling-wave waveguides to enhance interactions between giant atoms. Destructive interference is used to mitigate noise caused by squeezing. The system is based on χ^{(2)} nonlinearity, which allows for tailored interactions with adjustable parameters.

Result: The result is a scalable and versatile quantum simulation platform that enables the study of strongly correlated many-body physics. The interactions can be precisely tuned by adjusting squeezing and coupling parameters, and the noise-resilient platform addresses a major obstacle in quantum decoherence.

Conclusion: This research presents a promising approach for quantum simulation by combining giant atoms with parametric waveguides. The scalable solution with adjustable interactions opens new avenues for studying complex quantum systems and achieving robust quantum control.

Abstract: Parametric amplification offers a powerful means to enhance quantum interactions through field squeezing, yet it typically introduces additional noise which accelerates quantum decoherence, a major obstacle for scalable quantum information processing. The squeezing field is implemented in cavities rather than continuous waveguides, thereby limiting its scalability for applications in quantum simulation. Giant atoms, which couple to waveguides at multiple points, provide a promising route to mitigate dissipation via engineered interference, enabling decoherence-free interactions. We extend the squeezing-amplified interaction to a novel quantum platform combining giant atoms with traveling-wave parametric waveguides based on $χ^{(2)}$ nonlinearity. By exploiting destructive interference between different coupling points, the interaction between giant atoms is not only significantly enhanced but also becomes immune to squeezed noise. Unlike conventional waveguide quantum electrodynamics without a squeezing pump, the giant emitters exhibit both exchange and pairing interactions, making this platform particularly suitable for simulating many-body quantum physics. More intriguingly, the strengths of these interactions can be smoothly tuned by adjusting the squeezing and coupling parameters. Our architecture thus provides a versatile and scalable platform for quantum simulation of strongly correlated physics and paves the way toward robust quantum control in many-body regimes.

Abstract: Soon after the dawn of quantum error correction, DiVincenzo and Peres observed that stabilizer codewords could give rise to simple proofs of quantumness via contextuality. This discovery can be recast in the language of nonlocal games: every $n$-qubit stabilizer state defines a specific "stabilizer-testing" $n$-player nonlocal game, which quantum players can win with probability one. If quantum players can moreover outperform all possible classical players, then the state is contextual. However, the classical values of stabilizer-testing games are largely unknown for scalable examples beyond the $n$-qubit GHZ state. We introduce several new methods for upper-bounding the classical values of these games. We first prove a general coding-theory bound for all stabilizer-testing games: if the classical value $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* < 1$, then $p_{\mathrm{cl}}^* \leq 7/8$, i.e., there is no classical strategy that can perform as well as the optimal quantum strategy even in an asymptotic sense. We then show how to tighten this bound for the most common scalable examples, namely GHZ, toric-code and cyclic cluster states. In particular, we establish an asymptotically tight upper bound for cyclic cluster states using transfer-matrix methods. This leads to the striking conclusion that measuring an exponentially small fidelity to the cyclic cluster state will suffice to witness its contextuality.

Abstract: Self-testing is a correlation-based framework that enables the certification of both the underlying quantum state and the implemented measurements without imposing any assumptions on the internal structure of the devices. In this work, we introduce a self-testing protocol for the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state based on a natural generalization of Hardy's nonlocality argument. Within this framework, we prove that the correlation achieving the maximal Hardy success probability constitutes an extremal point of the quantum correlation set and, moreover, that this point is \emph{exposed}. To address experimentally relevant imperfections, we further develop a robust self-testing analysis tailored to the Hardy construction. Additionally, we show that, in this scenario, the quantum correlation that attains the maximal violation of the Hardy-type paradox coincides with the correlation that yields the maximal violation of the Mermin inequality. This establishes a unified perspective in which the same multipartite correlation admits both a logical-paradox interpretation and a Bell-inequality-based characterization. Collectively, our results pave the way for investigating whether the correlations that maximally violate the generalized $N$-party Hardy paradox remain exposed in higher-party regimes.

Abstract: Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certainty when performing single-site Pauli measurements on a state that is a codeword of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting quantum code. We show that these games require deterministic computation of a code-dependent Boolean function, and that the classical probability of success is upper bounded by a generalized notion of nonlinearity/nonquadraticity. This success probability quantifies the state's contextuality, and is computed via the function's (generalized) Walsh-Hadamard spectrum. To calculate this, we introduce an efficient, many-body-physics-inspired method that involves identifying the symmetries of an auxiliary hypergraph state. We compute the classical probability of success for several paradigmatic CSS codes and relate it to both classical statistical mechanics models and to strange correlators of symmetry-protected topological states. We also consider CSS submeasurement games, which can only be won with certainty by sharing the appropriate codeword up to local isometries. These games therefore enable self-testing, which we illustrate explicitly for the 2D toric code. We also discuss how submeasurement games enable an extensive notion of contextuality in many-body states.

Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in advancing quantum network analysis, particularly for complex topologies that are difficult to handle with traditional quantum circuit methods. The authors aim to provide a more efficient and scalable approach to simulate quantum walks, which are fundamental for quantum algorithms and network dynamics analysis.

Method: The method involves designing a quantum circuit using dual-register encoding to handle the varying degrees of nodes in complex networks. The authors implement the circuit using Qmod, a high-level quantum programming language, and evaluate performance through numerical simulations on Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabási-Albert models. They also experiment with the IBM ibm_torino processor for specific network sizes.

For small graph sizes (N=4 and N=8) on the IBM quantum processor, hardware-aware optimization slightly improves the $L_1$ distance for larger graphs, but connectivity constraints cause overhead for smaller graphs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while current NISQ devices are limited in scalability, the polynomial scaling of the proposed framework suggests potential for future large-scale implementations as quantum hardware improves in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Abstract: We propose a quantum circuit design for implementing coined quantum walks on complex networks. In complex networks, the coin and shift operators depend on the varying degrees of the nodes, which makes circuit construction more challenging than for regular graphs. To address this issue, we use a dual-register encoding. This approach enables a simplified shift operator and reduces the resource overhead compared to previous methods. We implement the circuit using Qmod, a high-level quantum programming language, and evaluated the performance through numerical simulations on Erdős-Rényi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barabási-Albert models. The results show that the circuit depth scales as approximately $N^{1.9}$ regardless of the network topology. Furthermore, we execute the proposed circuits on the ibm\_torino superconducting quantum processor for Watts-Strogatz models with $N=4$ and $N=8$. The experiments show that hardware-aware optimization slightly improved the $L_1$ distance for the larger graph, whereas connectivity constraints imposed overhead for the smaller one. These results indicate that while current NISQ devices are limited to small-scale validations, the polynomial scaling of our framework makes it suitable for larger-scale implementations in the early fault-tolerant quantum computing era.

Abstract: Four decades after Richard Feynman's famous remark, we have reached a stage at which nature can be simulated quantum mechanically. Quantum simulation is among the most promising applications of quantum computing. However, like many quantum algorithms, it is severely constrained by noise in near-term hardware. Quantum-inspired algorithms provide an attractive alternative by avoiding the need for error-prone quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate that the coherent Ising machine and simulated bifurcation algorithms can accurately reproduce the electronic energy profiles of H_2 and H_2O, capturing their essential energetic features. Notably, we obtain computational times of 1.2 s and 2.4 s for the H_2 and H_2O profiles, respectively, representing a substantial speed-up compared to gate-based quantum computing approaches, which typically require at least 6 s to compute a single molecular geometry with comparable accuracy. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired approaches for scaling to larger molecular systems and for future applications in chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions have largely been explored for projective or continuous measurements of Hermitian observables, assuming perfect detection without information loss. Yet such transitions also arise in more general settings, including quantum-jump processes with non-Hermitian jump operators, and under inefficient detection. A theoretical framework for treating these broader scenarios has been missing. Here we develop a comprehensive replica Keldysh field theory for general quantum-jump processes in both bosonic and fermionic systems. Our formalism provides a unified description of pure-state quantum trajectories under efficient detection and mixed-state dynamics emerging from inefficient monitoring, with deterministic Lindbladian evolution appearing as a limiting case. It thus establishes a direct connection between phase transitions in nonequilibrium steady states of driven open quantum matter and in measurement-induced dynamics. As an application, we study imbalanced and inefficient fermion counting in a one-dimensional lattice system: monitored gain and loss of fermions occurring at different rates, with a fraction of gain and loss jumps undetected. For imbalanced but efficient counting, we recover the qualitative picture of the balanced case: entanglement obeys an area law for any nonzero jump rate, with an extended quantum-critical regime emerging between two parametrically separated length scales. Inefficient detection introduces a finite correlation length beyond which entanglement, as quantified by the fermionic logarithmic negativity, obeys an area law, while the subsystem entropy shows volume-law scaling. Numerical simulations support our analytical findings. Our results offer a general and versatile theoretical foundation for studying measurement-induced phenomena across a wide class of monitored and open quantum systems.

Motivation: The work presents a novel approach to calculating QED corrections in finite Gaussian basis sets, with a focus on non-linear contributions to the vacuum polarization density. The motivation behind this study stems from the increasing demand for precision in relativistic effects in quantum systems, particularly in atomic and molecular physics.

Result: The authors successfully develop a numerical strategy to compute the energy shift with sufficient precision, enabling extrapolation to the complete basis set limit.

Conclusion: This work bridges a gap in computational QED by providing a robust framework for precise calculations of QED effects in finite basis sets, facilitating extrapolation to the continuum limit.

Abstract: This work further develops the calculation of QED effects in a finite Gaussian basis. We focus on the non-linear $α(Zα)^{n\ge 3}$ contribution to the vacuum polarization density, computing the energy shift of 1s$_{1/2}$ states of hydrogen-like ions. Our goal is to improve the numerical computations to achieve a precision comparable to that of Green's function methods reported in the literature. To do so, an analytic expression for the linear contribution to the vacuum polarization density is derived using Riesz projectors. Alternative formulations of the vacuum polarization density and their relation is discussed. The convergence of the finite Gaussian basis scheme is investigated, and the numerical difficulties that arise are characterized. In particular, an error analysis is performed to assess the method's robustness to numerical noise. We then report a strategy for computing the energy shift with sufficient precision to enable a sensible extrapolation of the partial-wave expansion. A key feature of the procedure is the use of even-tempered basis sets, allowing for an extrapolation towards the complete basis set limit.

Abstract: The recent paper by Sharoglazova et al. reports an energy-dependent parameter $ν$ extracted from the spatial distribution of photons in a coupled-waveguide experiment. The authors interpret $ν$ as the speed of quantum particles, even in the classically forbidden regime, and claim that its finite value contradicts the Bohmian mechanics prediction of zero particle velocity. This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics.

Abstract: We demonstrate a giant atom by coupling a superconducting transmon qubit to a lithium niobate phononic waveguide at two points separated by about 600 acoustic wavelengths, with a propagation delay of 125 ns. The giant atom yields non-Markovian relaxation dynamics characterized by phonon backflow and a frequency-dependent effective decay rate varying four-fold over merely 4 MHz, corresponding to a Purcell factor exceeding 40. Exploiting this frequency-dependent dissipation, we prepare quantum superposition states with high purity. Our results establish phononic integrated circuits as a versatile platform for giant-atom physics, providing highly tunable quantum devices for advanced quantum information processing.

Conclusion: 这项研究突破了固态系统中实现高相干性双 photon 对的独特方法，该方法不仅Letters上具有创新性，而且为量子信息处理和量子通信提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Decay of a four-level diamond scheme via a cascade is a potential source of entangled photon pairs. A solid-state implementation is the biexciton cascade in a semiconductor quantum dot. While high entanglement fidelities have been demonstrated, the two photons, XX and X, are temporally correlated, typically resulting in poor photon coherence. Here, we demonstrate a high two-photon interference visibility (a measure of the photon coherence) for both XX (V=94$\pm$2%) and X (V=82$\pm$6%) photons. This is achieved by Purcell-enhancing the biexciton transition in a low-noise device. We find that the photon coherence follows the well-known quantum optics result upon tuning the XX:X lifetime ratio over two orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: Pres-sidedrybians as qubits' limited scalability and speed issues are addressed by leveraging Rydberg states for strong, long-range interactions, enabling faster quantum computing and fault-tolerant error correction with native multiqubit gates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in overcoming the challenges of scalability and speed in quantum computing using conventional entangling gates, proposing an innovative solution through Rydberg states.

Method: The authors introduce a native controlled-controlled-Z gate using microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, optimizing a single-pulse protocol that considers Rydberg-state lifetimes. They also develop a fault-tolerant quantum error correction scheme using the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code.

Result: The proposed gate achieves fidelities above 97% under realistic conditions with execution times of about 2 microseconds. The Bacon-Shor code-based error correction is fully fault-tolerant on a linear Rydberg-ion chain despite limited qubit connectivity.

Conclusion: Rydberg-ion qubits offer a promising approach for fast, high-fidelity quantum computing and fault-tolerant quantum error correction, with the native gates and error correction schemes presented in this paper significantly advancing the field.

Abstract: Trapped ions as one of the most promising quantum-information-processing platforms, yet conventional entangling gates mediated by collective motion remain slow and difficult to scale. Exciting trapped ions to high-lying electronic Rydberg states provides a promising route to overcome these limitations by enabling strong, long-range dipole-dipole interactions that support much faster multi-qubit operations. Here, we introduce the first scheme for implementing a native controlled-controlled-Z gate with microwave-dressed Rydberg ions by optimizing a single-pulse protocol that accounts for the finite Rydberg-state lifetime. The resulting gate outperforms standard decompositions into one- and two-qubit gates by achieving fidelities above 97% under realistic conditions, with execution times of about 2 microseconds at cryogenic temperatures. To explore the potential of trapped Rydberg ions for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, and to illustrate the utility of three-qubit Rydberg-ion gates in this context, we develop and analyze a proposal for fault-tolerant, measurement-free quantum error correction using the nine-qubit Bacon-Shor code. Our simulations confirm that quantum error correction can be performed in a fully fault-tolerant manner on a linear Rydberg-ion chain despite its limited qubit connectivity. These results establish native multiqubit Rydberg-ion gates as a valuable resource for fast, high-fidelity quantum computing and highlight their potential for fault-tolerant quantum error correction.

Abstract: Topological matter provides natural platforms for robust, non-local information storage, central to quantum error correction. Yet, while the relation between entanglement and topology is well established, little is known about the role of nonstabilizerness (or magic), a pivotal concept in fault-tolerant quantum computation, in topological phases. We introduce the concept of topological magic response, the ability of a state to spread over stabilizer space when perturbed by finite-depth non-Clifford circuits. Unlike a topological invariant or order parameter, this response function probes how a phase reacts to non-Clifford perturbations, revealing the presence of non-local quantum correlations. In Ising-type spin chains, we show that symmetry-broken and paramagnetic phases lack such a response, whereas symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases always display it. To capture this, we utilize a combination of stabilizer Rényi entropies that, in analogy with topological entanglement entropy, isolates non-locally stored information. Using exact analytic computations and matrix product states simulations based on an algorithmic technique we introduce, we show that SPT phases doped with $T$ gates support robust topological magic response, while trivial phases remain featureless.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子机器学习模型的高效训练提供了新思路，为未来更大规模量子系统的训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning models typically require expensive on-chip training procedures and often lack efficient gradient estimation methods. By employing Pauli propagation, it is possible to derive a symbolic representation of observables as analytic functions of a circuit's parameters. Although the number of terms in such functional representations grows rapidly with circuit depth, suitable choices of ansatz and controlled truncations on Pauli weights and frequency components yield accurate yet tractable estimators of the target observables. With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems. This also enables a form of classical pre-training through gradient-based optimization prior to deployment on quantum hardware. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for obtaining the ground state of a spin model, showing that accurate results can be achieved with a scalable and computationally efficient procedure.

Motivation: 本研究关注于量子力学中的动态非局域性，即虽然当前量子系统在每个瞬间都可以通过局部隐变量模型来描述其测量统计，但观察到的动态非局域性是否随着时间的推移而演变呢？这个问题具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Method: 我们通过构建一个动态局部隐变量模型框架，结合一系列假设条件，系统地分析了局部隐变量模型在随时间变化的情况下的适用性。通过构建一个基于时间的贝尔不等式，我们对观察到的动态非局域性进行了严格的数学分析。

Result: 我们的研究结果表明，尽管在大多数情况下可以通过局部隐变量模型来描述观察到的动态测量统计，但在某些特定情况下，这样的描述是不成立的。我们提出了一个适用于大多数情况的严格数学证明，表明观察到的动态非局域性并不总是可以通过局部隐变量模型来解释。

Abstract: Bell nonlocality is an intriguing property of quantum mechanics with far reaching consequences for information processing, philosophy and our fundamental understanding of nature. However, nonlocality is a statement about static correlations only. It does not take into account dynamics, i.e. time evolution of those correlations. Consider a dynamic situation where the correlations remain local for all times. Then at each moment in time there exists a local hidden-variable (LHV) model reproducing the momentary correlations. Can the time evolution of the correlations then be captured by evolving the hidden variables? In this light, we define dynamical LHV models and motivate and discuss potential additional physical and mathematical assumptions. Based on a simple counter example we conjecture that such LHV dynamics does not always exist. This is further substantiated by a rigorous no-go theorem. Our results suggest a new type of nonlocality that can be deduced from the observed time evolution of measurement statistics and which generically occurs in interacting quantum systems.

Abstract: Progress in quantum computing and networking depends on codesign across abstraction layers: device-level noise and heterogeneous hardware, algorithmic structure, and distributed classical control. We present QuantumSavory, an open-source toolkit built to make such end-to-end studies practical by cleanly separating a symbolic computer-algebra frontend from interchangeable numerical simulation backends. States, operations, measurements, and protocol logic are expressed in a backend-agnostic symbolic language; the same model can be executed across multiple backends (e.g., stabilizer, wavefunction, phase-space), enabling rapid exploration of accuracy-performance tradeoffs without rewriting the model. Furthermore, new custom backends can be added via a small, well-defined interface that immediately reuses existing models and protocols.
  QuantumSavory also addresses the classical-quantum interaction inherent to LOCC protocols via discrete-event execution and a tag/query system for coordination. Tags attach structured classical metadata to quantum registers and message buffers, and queries retrieve, filter, or wait on matching metadata by wildcards or arbitrary predicates. This yields a data-driven control plane where protocol components coordinate by publishing and consuming semantic facts (e.g., resource availability, pairing relationships, protocol outcomes) rather than by maintaining rigid object graphs or bespoke message plumbing, improving composability and reuse as models grow. Our toolkit is also not limited to qubits and Bell pairs; rather, any networking dynamics of any quantum system under any type of multipartite entanglement can be tackled. Lastly, QuantumSavory ships reusable libraries of standard states, circuits, and protocol building blocks with consistent interfaces, enabling full-stack examples to be assembled, modified, and compared with minimal glue code.

Abstract: One of the traditional ways of introducing bosons and fermions is through creation and annihilation algebras. Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of distinguishable particles, so that the resulting equivalence classes identify states that contain no information capable of distinguishing between particles, thereby generalising the usual symmetrisation procedure. Assuming that the resulting indistinguishable-particle space (i) admits an ordered basis compatible with how an observer may label the accessible modes, (ii) is invariant under unitary transformations of those modes, and (iii) supports particle counting as a mode-wise local operation, we derive a new class of creation-annihilation algebras. These algebras reproduce the partition functions of transtatistics-maximal generalisations of bosons and fermions consistent with these operational principles.

Abstract: We introduce a mixed-state magic criterion, the Triangle Criterion, which plays a role for magic analogous to the Positive Partial Transposition (PPT) criterion for entanglement: it combines strong detection capability, a clear geometric interpretation, and an operational link to magic distillation. Using this criterion, we uncover several new features of multi-qubit magic distillation and detection. We prove that genuinely multi-qubit magic distillation protocols are strictly more powerful than all single-qubit schemes by showing that the Triangle Criterion is not stable under tensor products, in sharp contrast to the PPT criterion. Moreover, we show that, with overwhelming probability, multi-qubit magic states with relatively low rank cannot be distilled by any single-qubit distillation protocol. We derive an upper bound on the minimal purity of magic states, which is conjectured to be tight with both numerical and constructive evidences. Using this minimal-purity result, we predict the existence of unfaithful magic states, namely states that cannot be detected by any fidelity-based magic witness, and reveal fundamental limitations of mixed-state magic detection in any single-copy scheme.

Abstract: Data-processing is a desired property of classical and quantum divergences and information measures. In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be improved in most of the cases. In this work, we establish non-linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergence for noisy channels that satisfy a certain noise criterion. We also note that our results improve upon existing linear SDPI for quantum hockey-stick divergences and also non-linear SDPI for classical hockey-stick divergence. We define $F_γ$ curves generalizing Dobrushin curves for the quantum setting while characterizing SDPI for the sequential composition of heterogeneous channels. In addition, we derive reverse-Pinsker type inequalities for $f$-divergences with additional constraints on hockey-stick divergences. We show that these non-linear SDPI can establish tighter finite mixing times that cannot be achieved through linear SDPI. Furthermore, we find applications of these in establishing stronger privacy guarantees for the composition of sequential private quantum channels when privacy is quantified by quantum local differential privacy.

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将复杂性度量工具扩展至色散无序的MBL领域，填补了这一研究空白，对量子模拟器的技术发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Quantum many-body disorder-free localization can suppress transport while still allowing the buildup of computationally costly non-Clifford resources. In a transverse-field Ising chain realizing disorder-free Stark many-body localization, we show that the stabilizer Rényi entropy remains nonzero and grows slowly to a finite plateau deep in the strong Stark-field regime, with strong initial-state selectivity. As the Stark field strength increases, long-time magic and entanglement consistently signal a crossover from ergodic to constrained localized dynamics. These results establish nonstabilizerness (``magic'') as a practical complexity probe for disorder-free ergodicity breaking and constrained localization, with direct relevance to benchmarking and designing near-term quantum simulators, and fill a gap in the understanding of nonstabilizerness in disorder-free many-body localization.

Motivation: Constructing Gaussian purification channels is important for understanding Gaussian states and their applications in quantum information.

Method: Representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups is used to characterize the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries, aiding in the construction of the Gaussian purification channel.

Result: The constructed channel doubles the mean photon number of each purification's state.

Conclusion: This work advances our understanding of Gaussian states and their purification processes, with implications for quantum optics and quantum information theory.

Abstract: The random purification channel, which, given $n$ copies of an unknown mixed state $ρ$, prepares $n$ copies of an associated random purification, has proved to be an extremely valuable tool in quantum information theory. In this work, we construct a Gaussian version of this channel that, given $n$ copies of a bosonic passive Gaussian state, prepares $n$ copies of one of its randomly chosen Gaussian purifications. The construction has the additional advantage that each purification has a mean photon number which is exactly twice that of the initial state. Our construction relies on the characterisation of the commutant of passive Gaussian unitaries via the representation theory of dual reductive pairs of unitary groups.

Abstract: Simulating electron-phonon interactions on quantum computers remains challenging, with most algorithmic effort focused on Hamiltonian simulation and circuit optimization. In this work, we study the single-electron Holstein model and propose an initial-state ansatz that substantially enhances ground state overlap in the strong coupling regime, thereby reducing the number of iterations required in standard quantum phase estimation. We further show that this ansatz can be implemented efficiently and yields an exponential reduction in overall circuit costs relative to conventional initial guesses. Our results highlight the practical value of incorporating physical intuition into initial state preparation for electron-phonon coupled systems.

Abstract: Interpreting multi-messenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance-computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical-relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable pointwise and stencil-wise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and CarpetX) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron-star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.

Abstract: We consider various possible consequences of time-varying dark energy due to a quintessence scalar field whose energy density is partially converted to particles as the field evolves down its potential. This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A simple four-parameter model based on the greybody factor accurately reproduces the frequency-domain amplitude of a large set of comparable-mass, aligned-spin numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, achieving mismatches of order $	ext{O}(10^{-5})$.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to simplify the modeling of post-merger ringdown signals in binary black hole coalescence by introducing a four-parameter greybody model that matches numerical relativity waveforms with high precision.

Method: A four-parameter greybody model is developed and calibrated using data from the SXS catalog. The model's parameters are analytically expressed in terms of progenitor masses and spins.

Result: The model achieves mismatches of order ${	ext{O}}(10^{-5})$, representing a significant improvement over existing models by approximately two orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: The study shows that a simple model can effectively capture the ringdown signal's frequency characteristics, enabling new consistency tests in black hole spectroscopy.

Abstract: It was recently shown that, in a binary coalescence, the greybody factor of the remnant black hole modulates the post-merger ringdown signal. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple four-parameter model based on the greybody factor accurately reproduces the frequency-domain amplitude of a large set of comparable-mass, aligned-spin numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, achieving mismatches of order ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and improving existing models by roughly two orders of magnitude. We also identify the optimal initial frequency for applying the model in the frequency domain and provide analytical fits of the model parameters in terms of the progenitor masses and aligned spins. Our results pave the way for new consistency tests of the ringdown phase, complementary to traditional black hole spectroscopy.

Abstract: Massive scalar fields on black hole backgrounds generally admit two families of modes: quasi-bound states (QBS) and quasinormal modes (QNM). We demonstrate the orthogonality between the two mode families with respect to a relativistic product. We also find that, although the two families appear on different Riemann sheets of the Green's function of massive scalar perturbations, they can be brought to a single sheet with an appropriate redefinition of the frequency variable. In this variable, it is more natural to see how both mode families can be excited by initial data, and to approximate the Green's function with saddle points. Finally, we investigate the QNM emission from boson clouds - the latter effectively consisting of a single QBS - driven by the tidal perturbation of a second compact object. We show that while the resonant emission of QNMs is generally suppressed, QNM transitions may be more prominent when the interaction with the perturber is non-resonant, such as in the dynamical capture of unbound objects, and when the perturber transits close to the light ring.

Abstract: To establish a self-consistent effective one-body (EOB) theory that describes the dynamical evolution of binary systems based on the post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation, where the Hamiltonian, radiation reaction force, and waveforms are derived from an effective metric, the primary objective is to obtain the effective metric. Given that third generation gravitational wave detectors require at least fifth-order PM accuracy, in this paper we constructed an effective metric in the EOB theory of binaries up to fifth PM order. The effective metric is of type D, allowing for the derivation of decoupled and variable-separable equations for the null tetrad component of the gravitational perturbed Weyl tensor. This presents a basis for us to establish a self-consistent EOB theory up to 5PM order.

Abstract: We present a detailed geometric analysis of adiabatic, anisotropic gravitational collapse formulated in a single Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinate system that covers both the interior and exterior, thereby eliminating cross-chart matching artifacts. Building on the Oppenheimer-Snyder framework with a phenomenologically motivated energy-density profile, we enforce the Israel junction conditions and obtain closed-form surface evolution. Within this unified chart we derive exact solutions for the complete collapse process, characterize the causal structure, and track horizon formation and evolution. In particular, we identify and analyse a double apparent-horizon phase inside the matter and show that the event horizon stabilizes at the Schwarzschild radius. We further obtain critical parameter relations that govern the dynamics, including a threshold linking initial compactness to immediate horizon formation. The model is geometrically self-consistent within Einstein's equations but exhibits violations of the standard point-wise energy conditions, highlighting known limitations of idealized anisotropic matter models and delineating the boundary where classical descriptions become inadequate. Together, these results provide geometric insights, compact analytic benchmarks and a didactic, coordinate-uniform perspective on collapse and horizon dynamics.

Abstract: We construct and analyze a class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes in general relativity sourced exclusively by classical electrostatic configurations. Using a spherically symmetric Painlevé-Gullstrand-like metric with unit lapse and a radial shift function, we develop piecewise-defined solutions where the interior geometry is flat and the exterior is supported by several sources inspired by electromagnetic distributions. These include point-charge-like fields, Yukawa-screened electric fields, dielectric layers, and Hulthén-type field. The Einstein equations naturally impose a relation between the energy density and radial pressure, while the tangential pressure is derived from the metric. We systematically evaluate the classical energy conditions in each model and study the appearance of singular behavior using Israel junction conditions. This framework offers an analytically tractable setting to explore the gravitational effects of physically simple, well-understood sources without resorting to exotic matter.

TL;DR: The paper presents two dynamical system formulations for $f(R,φ,X)$ gravity theories, applies them to specific models, and finds that the second formulation performs better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of gravity theories through dynamical system formulations is important for studying cosmological models like inflation.

Method: The authors used two different dynamical system approaches to analyze specific gravity theories.

Result: The second formulation was more effective in capturing the dynamics of the studied models.

Conclusion: The second method is preferred for analyzing such gravity theories.

Abstract: Two different dynamical system formulations are presented for the generic $f(R,φ,X)$ family of gravity theories. As illustrative examples, the first and the second formulation is applied to study the phase space of a toy model of the Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling (NMDC) without a potential, and the mixed $R^2$-Higgs inflation model, respectively. The first dynamical system formulation applied to the toy NMDC model, although able to identify several invariant submanifolds, fails to fully investigate the fixed point structure, as all the fixed points turn out to be non-hyperbolic. We, however, discover an interesting feature that the qualitative dynamics are independent of the coupling strength between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field derivative. The second dynamical system formulation applied to the mixed $R^2$-Higgs inflation model performs much better, being able to correctly reduce to the individual phase spaces of the $R^2$ and Higgs inflation separately in special cases, as well as correctly delivering the expected invariant submanifolds and fixed points. For the mixed $R^2$-Higgs case, illustrative phase portraits are provided for a somewhat better understanding of the dynamics.

Abstract: We investigate the back-action from a spatially pointlike particle detector on a quantum scalar field, as characterised by the expectation value of the field's stress-energy tensor, without conditioning on a measurement of the detector. First, assuming the field to be initially in a zero-mean Gaussian Hadamard state in a globally hyperbolic spacetime, we evaluate the field's two-point function in second-order perturbation theory by techniques of covariant curved spacetime quantum field theory, which allow a full control of the time and space localisation of the interaction, and do not rely on field mode decompositions or non-local particle countings. The detector's two-point function splits into a deterministic and a fluctuating part, and we show that this split is maintained in the back-action.
  We then specialise to a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector, prepared in an energy eigenstate, for which the back-action is fully fluctuating. We compute the renormalised stress-energy tensor for a massless scalar field in $(3+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for a general detector trajectory, using the manifestly causal two-point function. We present explicit analytic and numerical results for an inertial detector and a uniformly linearly accelerated detector, switched on in the asymptotic past. The energy flux into and out of the accelerated detector accounts exactly for the energy gained and lost by the detector in its transitions due to the Unruh effect. The same holds for the outward flux associated with de-excitations of the inertial detector, which has a vanishing excitation rate and no inward flux. A novelty with the accelerated detector is two regions of negative energy density when the detector is initially prepared in its ground state, one near the Rindler horizon that bounds the causal future of the trajectory, the other in the far future of the trajectory.

### [147] [Gravitational wave interactions with a viscous fluid: Core collapse supernova, binary neutron star merger, and accretion around a black hole merger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16253)
*Nigel T. Bishop,Vishnu Kakkat,Monos Naidoo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Gravitational waves interacting with a viscous fluid can significantly dampen and heat the fluid when the source and observer are within a certain distance related to the gravitational wave wavelength. This effect is not limited to flat spacetime but can also occur in more complex backgrounds. These results are applied to several astrophysical scenarios, including supernovae, neutron star mergers, and black hole mergers, where the effects can range from moderate damping to extreme heating, such as gamma-ray bursts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interaction of gravitational waves with matter is crucial for interpreting their effects in various astrophysical scenarios. Extending previous studies to non-flat spacetime backgrounds broadens the applicability of these findings.

Method: The research extends previous work by considering perturbations in a general, non-vacuum, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. They derive expressions for gravitational wave damping and resulting fluid heating effects and implement these in computer code to model different astrophysical scenarios.

Result: Gravitational waves can cause significant damping and heating of a viscous fluid under certain conditions. In some cases, these effects are orders of magnitude greater than those predicted in flat spacetime. In extreme cases, a gravitational wave signal can be completely damped, and the resulting heating can lead to the production of gamma-ray bursts.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that gravitational waves radiated by compact objects can have non-negligible effects on surrounding matter even at short distances. This has important implications for understanding the dynamics and energetics of processes involving gravitational waves, such as during supernova explosions, neutron star mergers, and black hole mergers.

Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is normally treated as being insignificant. However, recent work has shown that the interaction with a viscous fluid may be astrophysically important when the distance between the matter and GW source is somewhat smaller than the GW wavelength. Previous work has mainly considered perturbations on a Minkowski background, and here these results are extended to the case that the background is a general, non-vacuum, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Expressions are obtained for GW damping and the consequent heating of the fluid, and implemented in computer code. The results are applied to astrophysical scenarios: Core collapse supernovae, the post-merger signal from a binary neutron star merger, and matter accreting at a binary black hole merger. It is found that, compared to the Minkowski case, the damping and heating effects increase, in some cases by several orders of magnitude. It is possible for a GW signal to be completely damped, and for the heating to be such that a gamma-ray burst occurs.

### [148] [Phantom Menace in general Palatini $f(R,φ)$ theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16256)
*Rahul Thakur*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines general $f(R,φ)$ theories in the Palatini formalism, aiming to unify inflationary and late-time expansion in a single model. The authors derive conditions for consistency in weak gravity regimes and various cosmic expansion eras, concluding that the theories remain viable under certain conditions. By assuming the curvature part behaves like Starobinsky gravity, they assess post-inflation dynamical stability in the Einstein frame and identify two stable fixed points. One fixed point, driven by a phantom scalar field, is more consistent with observational data from DESI, Cosmic Chronometers, and SNeIa. However, the time scales suggest this fixed point may be transient, potentially evolving toward another stable state dominated by scalar field energy in the distant future.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the unification of inflationary and late-time expansion is crucial for addressing fundamental questions in cosmology, such as the nature of dark energy and the evolution of the universe. The study of $f(R,φ)$ theories provides a framework for exploring alternative gravitational and scalar field dynamics that could explain these cosmic epochs.

Method: The authors employ a systematic analysis of the $f(R,φ)$ theories within the Palatini formalism, deriving conditions for consistency across different gravity regimes and cosmic eras. Dynamical systems methods are applied to identify fixed points and analyze their stability, with careful consideration of observational constraints using datasets like DESI, Cosmic Chronometers, and SNeIa.

Result: The study finds that $f(R,φ)$ theories can consistently describe both inflationary and late-time accelerating expansion under specific conditions. It identifies two fixed points: one with expansion driven by a phantom scalar field, which is observationally viable, and another potentially transient state that may dominate in the distant future.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the development of viable gravitational theories that unify different cosmological epochs, offering potential explanations for the observed universe's evolution. The identified stable fixed points provide concrete models for future research, while the transient nature of some solutions suggests the need for further investigations into the universe's ultimate fate.

Abstract: We study general $f(R,φ)$ theories in Palatini formalism and attempt to constrain the behavior of ones that could support both inflationary and late-time expansion era in a unified model. In particular, we find conditions for which the theories remain consistent in weak gravity regimes as well as cosmic expansion eras in both early and late universe. Assuming that the curvature part of the $f(R,φ)$ behaves as Starobinsky gravity, we assess post-inflation dynamical stability of the theory in Einstein frame and proceed to isolate two distinct fixed points that provide a stable late-time accelerating universe. Comparison with DESI, Cosmic Chronometers, and SNeIa datasets adds more stringent constraints to the behavior of the theory near the present epoch, giving us one stable fixed point where expansion is driven by a phantom scalar field. However, time scales of the two fixed points suggest that this fixed point may be transient and may eventually evolve toward a stable expansion stage driven potential domination in the distant future of the universe.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: EMRI parameter estimation is robust to glitch streams in LISA observations unless they are strongly mitigated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding EMRI (Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals) is crucial for gravitational wave astronomy. Glitches can bias parameter estimation, so it's important to assess their impact.

Method: The study uses simulated LISA observations with injected EMRIs and glitch streams. A Fisher-matrix analysis is employed to estimate biases, validated with MCMC.

Result: Glitch-induced biases are minimal (<1σ) for EMRI parameters unless glitches have high SNR (~400). This suggests EMRIs are more robust to glitches compared to other sources like massive black hole binaries.

Conclusion: While some glitch mitigation is necessary, EMRI inference can be reliable even with moderate glitch handling in LISA data.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of streams of transient, non-Gaussian noise artifacts or "glitches" on the parameter estimation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Glitches cause biased and less precise inference for short-duration signals such as massive black hole binaries, but their effect on long-lived sources such as EMRIs has not been quantified. Using simulated LISA observations containing injected EMRIs and streams of shapelet-based glitches drawn from the LISA Pathfinder catalog, we estimate the glitch-induced parameter biases and uncertainties through a Fisher-matrix-based analysis whose accuracy we verify with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo. We find that moderately mitigated glitch streams i.e. ones containing only glitches of up to moderate SNRs ($ρ\lesssim 90$) induce negligible to minor biases $[\sim0.04σ,\sim0.6σ]$ in the inferred EMRI parameters. In contrast, weakly mitigated glitch streams containing higher-SNR events ($ρ\lesssim 400$) can produce biases nearing $1σ$. These results demonstrate that, when compared to inference of other sources such as massive black hole binaries, EMRI inference is notably more robust to glitches. We stress that at least some amount of glitch modeling and mitigation remains essential for unbiased EMRI analyses in the LISA era.

Abstract: We examine the motion of an electron constrained to follow a magnetic field line near a primordial sub-stellar mass black hole. Earlier studies treated the problem in flat (Minkowski) spacetime, yielding qualitatively correct results and introducing a light cylinder (LC), a hypothetical surface where the linear velocity of rotation equals the speed of light. However, this picture changes significantly when gravity is included. By analyzing the electron's dynamics in the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain a modified light cylinder (MLC) whose geometry no longer resembles a cylinder. We then determine the maximum energies attainable by the electrons under the limiting effects of inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation, and synchrotron radiation.

Abstract: Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens-source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.

Abstract: Total transmission modes (TTMs) are modes with complex frequencies that propagate across a black hole spacetime without reflection. Recently, it is found that suitably tailored time-dependent scattering can excite these complex modes and suppress the reflected signal for the entire duration of the process, a phenomenon referred to as virtual absorption. Motivated by this, we present the study of the spectrum stability of TTMs using pseudospectrum and condition numbers. We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes. A notable exception is a purely imaginary TTM whose pseudospectrum's contours are nearly concentric and whose condition number is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the overtones, indicating enhanced spectral stability. Additionally, we confirm that purely imaginary TTMs occur only for spin $s=2$, whereas genuinely complex TTM families appear only in sufficiently high dimensions, $d \geqslant 8$, extending earlier claims that placed the onset at $d \geqslant 10$.

Abstract: This work investigates the nonlinearity of the power-law model of F(T) gravity, highlighting the inability of the Boltzmann solver CLASS to handle nonlinear models. As a workaround, a second-order Taylor expansion is applied to the nonlinear field equations, under the assumption that the extra degree of freedom n, which quantifies deviations from the currently favored cosmological model (ΛCDM), remains sufficiently small to preserve the key properties of the ΛCDM model. The validity of the Taylor expansion is supported by supernova data indicating n \leq 0.05, for which the power spectrum can be accurately computed within CLASS with a negligible truncation error.

Abstract: We derive an extended expression for the relaxation time of a barotropic Israel-Stewart (IS) fluid using the non-linear causality constraint, and propose a new formulation for modeling causal viscous dissipation in barotropic fluids. With this generalized relaxation time, the non-linear IS equation simplifies to a first-order non-linear expression connecting bulk viscous pressure and energy density, which remains valid in any homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed. Finally, we solve the coupled EIS equations numerically, and show that the model can support a transient Hubble slow-roll expansion phase with a smooth exit to a radiation-dominated universe, which is challenging to obtain in standard inflationary models.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how Hawking radiation particles behave in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime, analyzing their propagator in the context of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of Hawking radiation particles in quantum field theory in curved spacetime is motivated by the reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general relativity, particularly in understanding the behavior of quantum particles near black holes.

Method: The authors employ the path-integral formalism to compute the propagator of Hawking particles in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime, analyzing its behavior under general-covariant principles.

Result: The computed propagator differs from expectations based on the path-integral formalism, suggesting limitations in applying this formalism to Hawking particle behavior in curved spacetime.

Conclusion: The findings imply that quantum field theory in curved spacetime may not adequately explain the behavior of Hawking radiation particles, necessitating further research into alternative frameworks or methods.

Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum particles in the Earth's gravitational field are successfully described by the Schrödinger equation with Newton's gravitational potential. Particularly, quantum mechanics is in agreement with such experiments as free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity. However, quantum mechanics is a low-energy approximation to quantum field theory. The latter is successful by the description of high-energy experiments. Gravity is embedded in quantum field theory through the general-covariance principle. This framework is known in the literature as quantum field theory in curved spacetime, where the concept of a quantum particle is, though, ambiguous. In this article, we study in this framework how a Hawking particle moves in the far-horizon region of Schwarzschild spacetime by computing its propagator. We find this propagator differs from that which follows from the path-integral formalism -- the formalism which adequately describes both free fall and quantum interference induced by gravity.

Result: 无论原始标量势形状如何，若非极小耦合函数在零点附近极其陡峭，则标量势必定呈现指数平台期，且预测与斯 tarobinsky 模型一致。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了斯 tarobinsky 模型的应用范围，提供了度量仿射引力下通货膨胀的一条新途径。

Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity. Such a mechanism involves an inflaton non-minimally coupled with the Holst invariant. If the non-minimal coupling function has a zero point and it is very steep at that same point, then the canonically normalized inflaton potential always features an exponential plateau, regardless of the shape of the original inflaton potential. The inflationary predictions in such a region are equivalent to the ones of Starobinsky inflation.

Abstract: In this paper, we derive the $μ$-deformed Einstein field equations from the generalized thermodynamic functions of the $μ$-deformed analog of Bose gas model, applying the (adapted) Verlinde's approach. The basic role of deformation parameter is shown: it provides the possibility to vary the value of the cosmological constant. Due to this, we suggest an interesting treatment of the cosmological constant (CC) problem within the framework of $μ$-deformation. Namely, viewing the derived $μ$-deformed CC as an effective one and varying the parameter $μ$ appropriately, we gain the possibility to drastically reduce the CC, so as to get for it the realistic value. The relation to dark matter is of importance.

TL;DR:  paper shows that sound also has an infrared triangle, connecting memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems in condensed matter physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying the infrared behavior of field theories, especially in high-energy physics and condensed matter physics, to understand connections between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems.

Method:  studying linear perturbations of the Euler equations for a barotropic and irrotational fluid, using a two-form potential (Kalb-Ramond field) to describe the linear sound field as a gauge theory.

Result:  demonstrates that low-frequency changes in an acoustic source can lead to lasting displacements of fluid particles, and establishes a connection between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems in acoustics.

Conclusion: establishes the first example of an infrared triangle in a condensed matter system, providing new pathways for experimental detection of memory effects.

Abstract: Over the last few decades, there has been a considerable interest on the infrared behavior of various field theories. In particular, the connections between memory effects, asymptotic symmetries, and soft theorems (the ``infrared triangle'') have been explored in much depth within the context of high-energy physics. In this paper, we show how sound also admits an infrared triangle. We consider the linear perturbations of the Euler equations for a barotropic and irrotational fluid and show how low-frequency changes in an acoustic source can lead to lasting displacements of fluid particles. We proceed to write these linear perturbations in terms of a two-form potential -- a Kalb--Ramond field, in the high-energy physics terminology. This phrases linear sound as a gauge theory and thus allows the use of standard techniques to probe the infrared structure of acoustics. We show how the memory effect relates to asymptotic symmetries in this dual formulation, and comment on how these notions can be connected to soft theorems. This exhibits the first example of an infrared triangle in a condensed matter system and provides new pathways to the experimental detection of memory effects.

Abstract: Celestial amplitudes are multiple Mellin transforms w.r.t. conformal dimensions. For arbitrary multiplicity $n$ of massless states in sufficiently high space--time dimension $D$ we perform all Mellin integrations and find an associahedron description in celestial space. The latter expresses celestial tree--level $φ^3$ amplitudes as the canonical forms associated with this positive geometry. This yields a geometric interpretation of celestial amplitudes in terms of the underlying boundary geometry. In particular, distributional support on the celestial sphere is not imposed but arises geometrically. Our universal treatment of Mellin integrals in $D$ dimensions also provides a unified description of celestial amplitudes arising from different bulk theories, including (scalar-scaffolded) gluons and gravitons.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper introduces new methods to characterize quantum systems' Hilbert spaces using Brownian motion and disordered couplings, achieving universal entropy computation for black holes and exact results for finite-dimensional systems like spin clusters and SYK models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of understanding quantum systems' structure and entropy, particularly for black holes, by employing advanced stochastic processes and disordered systems techniques.

Method: The authors use Brownian motions in Hilbert spaces with disordered, time-dependent couplings, employing replica partition functions to calculate dimensions and entropy. They analyze both finite local systems and black holes, using techniques like semiclassical approximations and traversable wormhole constructions.

Result: For $q$-local systems, exact expressions for replica partition functions and entropy are found. For black holes, the method quantitatively recreates microstates leading to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy without relying on heavy operators or specific limits.

Conclusion: The methods provide a robust framework for quantum system analysis, demonstrating applicability to both finite systems and black holes with universal entropy computation.

Abstract: We introduce a new way to produce infinite families of bases of a quantum system's Hilbert space, as well as methods to find its dimension. These families are constructed via Brownian motions in the Hilbert space, defined using disordered, time-dependent couplings. The dimension spanned by them has zero variance over the ensemble of disordered couplings, and it is determined by certain replica partition functions. We apply these methods to finite dimensional $q$-local systems (spin clusters and SYK) and black holes. For $q$-local systems we find exact expressions at finite $q$, $N$, and $t$, for replica partition functions, together with universal behavior at large times and a semiclassical analysis at large-$N$ in appropriate master field variables. The right Hilbert space dimension is obtained for any time $t>0$, $q>1$ and $N>0$. For black holes, the Brownian motions prepare quantitatively generic ensembles of black hole microstates, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is universally reproduced by counting those. There the $n$-replica partition functions are constructed by gluing $n$-traversable womrholes at their future and past. This method demonstrates the robustness of black hole microstate counting methods, avoiding several limitations of previous constructions, including the non-genericity of the microstates and associated interiors, implicit statistics of heavy operators, limited microscopic control over overlaps, and the need for specific limits in the calculation.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究了SU(N)×U(1)理论在引力作用下的大N极限。发现带有q∼(N,1)电荷的夸克的黑洞在蒸发过程中，当电荷超过临界值时会趋近于极端状态（M_{BH}=√2 M_{Pl} Q_{BH}）。这是由于这些黑洞只能通过发射半单子（过程受组合因子e^{−N log N}限制）来失去电荷。当黑洞达到极端状态后，其演化会因时间长达exp(N log N)而停滞，但没有对称性保护。在t≫τ_{BH}时，黑洞会形成一个由自由夸克组成的云（夸克冠），夸克与horizon通过strings延续至远大于反色子能尺度的距离。由于能量守恒，这些长Strings无法断裂，即便夸克很轻。在基于这类Yang-Mills的时钟理论中，上述效应会放大。作为应用，我们给出实例说明极端质量的黑洞在今天还未蒸发，为解决高斯消融PBH问题开出了新思路。这个结果仅依赖于大N的组合学和对辐射机制、粒子质量及色子能尺度的独立性。我们讨论的理论通过了Swampland猜想的非trivial检验，包括谱完备性和弱引力猜想。

Motivation: 极端质量的黑洞尚未蒸发尚未被观测发现，这是当前理论物理和天体物理学中的一个重大问题。这项研究提供了新的理论框架，解释了这种极端情况下黑洞如何保存质量直到今天，并对现有的高斯消融机制提出挑战。

Method: 研究采用了模块化理论和量子场论的方法，特别考虑了SU(N)×U(1)理论在大N极限下的行为，并结合了引力理论的效应。

Result: 基于上述理论，我们导出了可以存在质量如同一克的黑洞，并且它们可以保存直到今天，从而为解决PBH（黑洞 Cosmology中的暗物质候选）问题提供了一个新思路。

Conclusion: 这是基础性的研究，展示了大N极限和字符串网络如何影响黑洞的演化解。理论上发现了一个新的参数空间，其中极端质量的黑洞可以存活至目前而未被蒸发，从而对PBH问题提出了一个强有力的解决方案，仅依赖于基本的统计组合学和无需依赖具体辐射机制或其他限制条件。

Abstract: We study some implications of $SU(N)\times U(1)$ theories coupled to gravity in the large-$N$ limit. We find that in theories with quarks transforming as $q\sim (\mathbf{N},1)$, black holes (BH) with charge larger than a critical value approach extremality $(M_{\rm BH}=\sqrt{2} M_{\rm Pl} Q_{\rm BH})$ as they evaporate. This occurs because BHs in this theory can only lose charge by emitting baryons, a process suppressed by a combinatoric factor $e^{-N\log N}$. Once extremality is reached the BH evolution halts for exponentially long times, $τ_{\rm BH}\gtrsim e^{N\log N}$, without being protected by any symmetry. At times $t\ggτ_{\rm BH}$ the BH forms a cloud of deconfined quarks around it, a \textit{quark corona}. The quarks are connected to the horizon by strings extending throughout distances that can be much larger than the inverse of the confinement scale, $Λ_N^{-1}$. Strikingly, due to energy conservation, these long strings cannot break even for light quarks. These effects can be further enhanced in clockwork-like theories based on Yang-Mills sectors of the type, $SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times ...\times U(1)$. As an application to phenomenology, we give examples where BHs as light as one gram survive until today without evaporating, opening up regions of parameter space for primordial BH dark matter previously excluded by Hawking evaporation. This result relies only on large-$N$ combinatorics and is independent of the radiation mechanism from the BH, particle masses, and confinement scale. The theories we discuss pass non-trivial tests imposed by Swampland conjectures, including completeness of the spectrum as well as the weak gravity conjecture.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解Lanczos法与正交多项式的联系提供了新的视角，特别是对随机矩阵理论中的动力学问题有潜在的应用。

Abstract: We establish a direct correspondence between the Lanczos approach and the orthogonal polynomials approach in random matrix theory. In the large-$N$ and continuum limits, the average Lanczos coefficients and the recursion coefficients become equivalent, with the precise mapping $\sqrt{R(x)} = b(1-x)$ and $S(x) = a(1-x)$. As a result, the two formalisms yield identical expressions for the leading density of states. We further analyze the Krylov dynamics associated with the recursion coefficients and show that the orthogonal polynomials admit a natural interpretation as Krylov polynomials. This picture is realized explicitly in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble, where all quantities can be computed analytically.

Abstract: Recently, based on the curve-integral formulation for stringy Tr$φ^3$ amplitudes, a combinatorial formulation for Yang-Mills amplitudes has been proposed which describes gluons using pairs of scalars and produces the $n$-gluon amplitude from simple kinematical shift of stringy Tr$φ^3$ amplitudes with $2n$ scalars. It has revealed a variety of new properties and structures even for tree-level gluon amplitudes such as hidden zeros and splits, and in this note we provide another example: we study differential operators acting on Yang-Mills amplitudes with respect to $2n$-scalar kinematic variables, which convert such scalar-scaffolded gluons into scalars. In particular, we find $(n{-}1)$-fold differential operators (using $2n$-scalar variables) that turn the $n$-gluon amplitude into a single planar $φ^3$ diagram; we then generalize such operators to those that convert $n$ gluons to mixed amplitudes with $r$ scalars and $n{-}r$ gluons (the latter can be viewed as insertions on $φ^3$ diagrams). We also show that the number of linearly independent mixed amplitudes with $r$ scalars and $n-r$ gluons is given by the number of $φ^3$ diagrams, the Catalan number $\mathcal{C}_{r-2}$, which can be viewed as a generalization of the ``uniqueness" theorem of gluon amplitudes (with $r=0$). Finally, our construction leads to a planar version of the universal expansion of Yang-Mills amplitudes into a sum of gauge-invariant prefactors built from nested commutators, each accompanied by an mixed amplitude in the natural basis. This formulation significantly reduces the redundancy present in the original expansion.

Motivation: 研究对称性破缺的熵度量在量子态中的应用，特别是在高阶形式对称性上的扩展，有助于更深入理解对称性与纠缠之间的关系。

Method: 通过计算量子态的纠缠熵，引入量子态微分熵的框架，分析对称性破缺的熵特性，证明了新定理，详细推导了纠缠熵在Goldstone模式和规范场中的行为。

Result: 研究结果表明，在$d≤p+2$的维度下，连续$p$-形式对称性无法自发破缺，自发破缺导致纠缠熵非零且在红外方向上逐步增加，同时表明金斯卡特模式数量。获得关于Goldstone玻色子和规范场的熵的独立结果。

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了对称性破缺的熵度量，为高阶形式对称性提供新的理论工具，并在子区域内证实了Coleman-Mermin-Wagner型定理的适用性，为理解量子纠缠与对称性相互作用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman--Mermin--Wagner theorem, for $0$- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields.

Abstract: Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetric models are known to undergo dimensional reduction; that is, their physics is captured by models in two fewer dimensions. In this work, we revisit dimensional reduction, providing new arguments and reformulating existing proofs in terms of the cohomology of a supercharge $Q$. We obtain three main results. First, we show that the recently developed picture of dimensional reduction via decoupling of operators admits a natural explanation in terms of $Q$-exactness. Second, we provide a new proof of dimensional reduction using the supersymmetric localization argument. Third, we revisit Cardy's ``interpolation'' proof -- which is reminiscent of localization but does not rely on saddle-point methods -- and show that it can be understood as a consequence of deforming the action by a $Q$-exact term. Finally, we show that while existing nonperturbative proofs of dimensional reduction apply only to scalar Lagrangians, our formulation of Cardy's argument extends to any theory with Parisi--Sourlas supersymmetry.

Abstract: Conformal defects -- extended objects in conformal field theories -- carry localised excitations inherited from symmetry currents, known as the displacements and tilts. They capture the linear response of the defect to deformations of its shape or of its profile along internal symmetry directions. There is no universal formula for deformations beyond the linear order and this is subject to ambiguities of coordinate choices on coset spaces and scheme dependence in the quantum theory. We analyse the exact match between the two and identify the scheme independent quantities capturing nonlinearly realised symmetries. This leads to universal integral identities for correlation functions in the presence of tilts and displacements. We present several applications of them. We also study possible anomalies, recovering known ones, finding new expressions for them, and uncovering new ones.

Method: derive

Result: calculate time delay photon

Conclusion: must consider both EFT corrections and backreaction

Abstract: We derive the shockwave metric in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) by performing an ultra-relativistic boost of the charged black hole solution accompanied by a rescaling of its mass and charge, including leading order EFT corrections. In contrast to the neutral (Schwarzschild) case, where higher derivative operators leave the shockwave geometry unchanged, we show that electrically charged shockwaves receive nontrivial EFT corrections. We then compute the time delay experienced by a probe photon traversing the resulting charged shockwave. We find that two EFT contributions, the correction to the shockwave geometry and the backreaction induced by the probe photon, are both essential for obtaining a physical time delay that is invariant under field redefinitions of the metric.

Abstract: We provide a detailed analysis of the disk path integral of timelike Liouville theory, conceived as a tractable and precise toy-model quantum cosmology in two dimensions. Disk path integrals with the insertion of matter field operators, taken along a judiciously chosen complex contour, yield states akin to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction. Working in the fixed $K$-representation, where $K$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature, we compute the one-loop wavefunctions and put forward a conjecture for the all-loop expressions. A suitable pairing of Liouville disk path integrals yields a $K$-independent quantity that may form the basis for a well-defined inner product on the space of Euclidean histories. We also consider other ensembles, including one with fixed area, and provide a static patch perspective with a timelike feature.

Abstract: The aim of this Thesis is twofold. On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenböck torsion plays a crucial rôle. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories.

Abstract: Chiral and conformal anomalies are fundamental phenomena that span multiple disciplines, including high-energy physics, condensed matter theory and cosmology. These anomalies play a crucial role in understanding fundamental interactions and manifest themselves through divergences and traces of correlation functions. In this thesis, we investigate these phenomena within the framework of conformal field theory, elucidating their intricate structure and physical implications. Our primary focus is on the role of conformal Ward identities in fully characterizing parity-odd interactions associated with chiral and conformal anomalies in momentum space. Furthermore, we explore mechanisms that lead to the breaking of conformal invariance, such as finite-temperature and finite-density effects or the presence of a fermion mass, and examine how parity-odd anomalous interactions behave under these conditions. By analyzing these phenomena through the lens of conformal and thermal field theories, we obtain deeper insights into their mathematical structure and their significance across a wide range of physical contexts.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the thermal partition function formalized by Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein, employing the S-matrix operator.

Motivation: This paper extends the DMB formalism to resolve IR divergences, aiming for advanced applications in QFT.

Method: Uses the DMB formalism, evaluating the thermal free energy at O(α_s) and O(λ^2), addressing IR divergences via the Debye mass.

Result: The Debye mass arises naturally within the DMB formalism, successfully resolving IR divergences at specified orders.

Conclusion: The DMB formalism provides a framework for handling thermal free energy calculations in relativistic QFT by incorporating the Debye mass to resolve IR divergences.

Abstract: The formalism of Dashen, Ma and Bernstein (DMB) expresses the thermal partition function of a system in terms of the S-matrix operator, roughly $Z(β) \propto \int dE\, e^{-βE}\,\text{Tr}\,\ln S(E),$ where $S$ denotes the full scattering operator on the asymptotic Fock space -- i.e. including all multi-particle sectors -- defined via the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Recently we have employed this formalism to compute the free energy of flux tubes (essentially a two-dimensional theory of derivatively coupled scalars) and the two-loop $O(α_s)$ QCD thermal free energy. Moving to higher orders, it is well known that at $O(α_s^2)$ in QCD, or e.g. at $O(λ^2)$ in $λφ^4$ theory, the free energy develops IR divergences. These IR divergences are resolved by the screening Debye mass. However, the DMB formalism expresses the free energy in terms of a trace of the S-matrix operator in the vacuum. How, then, does the Debye mass arise in this framework? In this work we address this question, thereby paving the way for higher-order applications of the DMB formalism in relativistic QFT.

Abstract: Semiclassical black hole emission in four spacetime dimensions is studied using a non-local effective action. The field equations that determine the time-dependent renormalized stress tensor are solved numerically for a black hole formed by an ingoing null shock wave, and otherwise smooth initial data. We find that Hawking radiation is generated dynamically near the black hole horizon and freely propagates out to null infinity, resulting in an outgoing energy flux that builds up from zero at early retarded times before the black hole forms. This resolves the long-standing issue of pre-Hawking radiation, suffered by calculations based on a static approximation to the stress tensor in an Unruh state, and paves the way towards four-dimensional black hole evolution with semiclassical back-reaction included.

Abstract: We study holographic c-theorems based on timelike entanglement entropy and show that a timelike c-function captures irreversible renormalization group (RG) flow. We demonstrate that timelike c-functions are applicable to both relativistic and non-relativistic quantum matter in nematic phases with broken rotational symmetry, and that they remain monotonic even under anisotropic RG flows, thereby passing some of the most stringent consistency tests. Across all classes of theories examined, we find that the null energy condition, thermodynamic stability, and a constraint on an effective spatial dimensionality are jointly sufficient to guarantee monotonicity of the timelike c-function along the RG flow. Moreover, we identify a geometric upper bound on the rate of change of the timelike c-function, which constrains how rapidly effective degrees of freedom can be coarse-grained along the RG flow whenever a timelike c-theorem applies. The applicability of holographic c-theorems is thus extended to highly nontrivial RG flows and points toward a new information-theoretic diagnostic of holographic RG dynamics.

Abstract: The trace anomaly and anomaly-induced action are evaluated for the two-dimensional $2D$ vector theory with classical conformal symmetry. Implementing local conformal symmetry while preserving the gauge invariance requires either giving up locality of the classical action or, equivalently, introducing an auxiliary scalar field. The two-dimensional limit in such a theory is singular. However, in the dimensional regularization, the limit $D \to 2$ in the one-loop divergence is smooth. As a result, we arrive at the expression for anomaly, which has a rich general structure, typical for the dimensions $D \geq 4$. For comparison and completeness, we also evaluate anomalies for conformal scalar and fermions, also in the presence of auxiliary external scalars.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of quantum field theories in curved spacetime is motivated by the desire to understand fundamental issues in quantum gravity and the early universe physics.

Method: The authors employ canonical quantization of a free scalar field in de Sitter space to demonstrate the unitary inequivalence of vacuum states on different time slices.

Result: The results show that the vacuum states at different time slices are unitarily inequivalent, even for infinitesimally small time steps.

Conclusion: This finding implies significant challenges in defining a consistent quantum theory of gravitation in curved spacetime, necessitating further theoretical developments.

Abstract: It is known that quantum field theories in curved spacetime suffer from a number of pathologies, including the inability to relate states on different spatial slices by proper unitary time-evolution operators. In this article, we illustrate this issue by describing the canonical quantisation of a free scalar field in de Sitter space and explicitly demonstrating that the vacuum at a given time slice is unitarily inequivalent to that at any other time. In particular, we find that, if both background and Hamiltonian dynamics are taken into account, this inequivalence holds even for infinitesimally small time steps and not only in the asymptotic time limits.

Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a positive cosmological constant, $Λ$, in the presence of a boundary, $Γ$, of finite spatial size. The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $Γ$. The proximity of $Γ$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{Λ^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $Γ$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $Γ$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $ω\approx \pm 2πi T_{\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \gtrsim {K}{Λ^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\tfracη{s} = \tfrac{1}{4π}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $ζ=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime.

Abstract: In gauge theories, globally charged observables necessarily depend non-locally on the kinematical fields, with this dependence extending to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime. Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A sufficient condition for this is to impose kinematically non-local boundary conditions on the large gauge sector of the theory, and to invoke a relational notion of localisation for observables. This reveals a relatively underappreciated link between boundary conditions, and different notions of microcausality and locality. We develop this point through a detailed case study in scalar QED, describing non-local boundary conditions that allow a large family of observables on a codimension-1 bulk surface to be viewed as local to that surface, despite being dressed by asymptotic Wilson lines. We show that this property continues to hold within a perturbative quantisation of the theory, and we argue that this leads to a consistent local net of algebras that includes these charged observables in bulk algebras. We explain how this setup may be understood in terms of a preferred dynamical reference frame for small gauge transformations appearing in the boundary conditions. Many features of the theory (such as microcausality, the vacuum state, and the net of algebras of observables) depend on the choice of this frame, and we briefly discuss some repercussions of this for algebraic formulations of QFT. While our analysis is performed in QED, we expect our results to carry over qualitatively to more complicated theories including gravity.

Abstract: The Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) enables hybrid detection by combining scintillation and Cherenkov signals, providing superior event reconstruction capabilities compared to conventional neutrino detectors. We measured the light yield of Gd-compatible WbLS at varying concentrations from 0.35\% to 1\% by mass, using cosmic-ray muons in a 1-ton scale detector at BNL. The light yield is measured as (69.16 $\pm$ 6.92) ph / MeV at 0.35\% concentration, which increased to (87.32 $\pm$ 8.73) ph / MeV at 1\%. These results establish a quantitative basis for optimizing future WbLS-based detectors in neutrino physics.

Abstract: To face the higher levels of radiation due to the 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity during the High-Luminosity LHC, the CMS detector will replace the current Calorimeter Endcap (CE) using the High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) concept. The high-radiation regions of the the CE, where fluences between $1\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and doses of up to 2\,MGy are expected considering an integrated luminosity of $3\,ab^{-1}$, will be equipped with silicon pad sensors. This includes the entire electromagnetic as well as parts of the hadronic section of the CE. The silicon sensors are processed on 8-inch p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300\,\textmu m, 200\,\textmu m and 120\,\textmu m and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the full wafer area and tiling. With each main sensor, several small test structures (e.g. pad diodes) are hosted on the wafers, used for quality assurance and radiation hardness tests. In order to investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, these diodes have been irradiated with reactor neutrons at JSI (Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia) to fluences between $5\cdot10^{14}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$ and $1.5\cdot10^{16}~n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. This study focuses on the isothermal annealing behavior of the bulk material at different temperatures between 5.5°C and 60°C using electrical characterization and charge collection measurements. The results are used to extract the annealing time constants for this material and fluence range based on the Hamburg model approach to allow an estimation of the expected annealing effects in silicon sensors during the year-end technical stops and the long HL-LHC shutdowns. The annealing parameters found will make it possible to model the annealing behavior of p-type silicon detector projects at HL-LHC fluence ranges better than the existing Hamburg model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cryogenic cosmic ray muon veto system for low-background experiments like the QUEST-DMC dark matter search.

Method: Measured single photon response, gain, dark count noise, and correlated noise at varying voltages, and tested a SiPM-scintillator coupling in a 9.4K environment.

Result: Successfully characterised the sensor for muon detection and demonstrated initial functionality.

Conclusion: This work validates the SiPM for use in cryogenic systems, opening opportunities in astrophysics and dark matter studies.

Abstract: We report the characterisation of a FBK NUV-HD-cryo silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) sensor operated in an 9.4 $\pm$ 0.2 mK environment inside a dilution refrigerator, towards the development of a cryogenic cosmic ray muon veto system to be operated internal to a dilution refrigerator required for low background experiments such as the QUEST-DMC dark matter search experiment. We characterise the single photon response and the gain (the charge produced per detected photon), the dark count noise rate, and correlated noise contributions as a function of operating voltage. This paper also reports first proof of concept measurements of using a SiPM directly coupled to scintillator in a 9.4 mK temperature environment, towards detecting candidate cosmic ray muon signals.

Abstract: Designed to provide quality assurance for ion-beam radiotherapy, the prototype fIVI (filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging) Range Monitoring System is a two-layer tracker which employs double-sided strip-segmented silicon detectors. To meet the high demands of a clinical environment, a large sensitive area is required, along with a fast and compact readout. As this device utilizes sensors and readout electronics adapted from particle physics, where the expected energy and count rate differ significantly from radiotherapy, validation was necessary to ensure that these sensors would function effectively at the order 100 MeV/u energies and order MHz count rates expected during clinical irradiation. Tests were conducted using scattered subclinical 19 MeV protons at high intensity, and clinical 207 MeV/u carbon ions at low intensity to independently validate these variables. The detection system is found to operate at rates up to 1.3 MHz, with a negligible fraction of events being affected by pileup. The efficiency of hit reconstruction is high, with a timestamp resolution of 6.25 ns, and a coincidence window of 31.25 ns, as is required for clinical event rates. With these settings, over 90% of particle interactions are able to reconstruct unique hit positions and contribute to track formation. This device is the first system using large-area, high-resolution detectors which meets the demanding count rate requirements associated with clinical radiotherapy.

Abstract: The use of highly sensitive pixelated direct detectors has dramatically improved the performance of high energy instrumentation such as transmission electron microscopy. Here, we describe a recently developed monolithic active pixel sensor designed for low energy scanning electron microscopy applications. This detector enables electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) at lower energies and dose than are accessible with existing scintillator-coupled detectors, expanding grain orientation mapping capabilities to materials such as ceramics that are poor electron conductors. The high detector sensitivity allows collection of rich diffraction information - providing dislocation defect contrast that is otherwise not accessible via EBSD. Indeed, even the energy of single electron interaction events can be measured with this detector, which we demonstrate to energy filter diffraction patterns revealing details of how diffraction occurs at low energy.
