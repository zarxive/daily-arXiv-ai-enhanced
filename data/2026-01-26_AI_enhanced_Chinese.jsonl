One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \\textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \\textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\\textit{\\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\\textit{\\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\\,K, which is associated with an \\textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers.

While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition.

However, the broader adoption of QTF-AFM has been constrained by the difficulty of attaching a cantilever tip to a quartz tuning fork (QTF) with the positional and angular precision required for repeatable and reproducible probe fabrication. For stable operation, the tip must be placed precisely at the midline of a single tine, aligned parallel to the prong axis, and rigidly secured. Even slight lateral offsets or angular deviations disrupt the intrinsic antisymmetric flexural mode, induce torsional coupling, and ultimately lead to systematic image distortions and reduced measurement integrity. In this work, we present a comprehensive, semi-automated QTF-tip fabrication system that integrates precision alignment, real-time frequency-sweep monitoring, and controlled Q-factor tuning within a single workflow. Experimental characterization demonstrates consistent probe preparation across multiple trials, preservation of sharp and well-defined resonance responses with deliberately adjustable damping, and high-fidelity, high-resolution imaging in practical scanning tests.

However, the two challenges, low SOT efficiency and the need for in plane symmetry breaking field for perpendicular magnetization switching, greatly limit its practical implementation. In this work, the enhanced SOT efficiency of Platinum (Pt) SOT layer and field free perpendicular magnetization switching are achieved by integrating thin Ruthenium Oxide (RuO2) layer in our material stack. The optimal RuO2 thickness (0.5 nm) enhances 5.2 times Damping Like (DL) SOT efficiency compared with pure SOT layer (Pt), as determined by hysteresis loop shift measurements, with a relatively low resistivity (90 micro-Ohm-cm). Moreover, we achieve 3 times reduction of critical magnetization switching current density compared to reference sample. Our experimental findings also demonstrate Rashba-induced substantial field-free magnetization switching in the presence of an emergent built-in interfacial field. Notably, reliable multi resistance synaptic states are achieved by tailoring the synergistic effects of enhanced SOT and interfacial magnetism. The functionality of synaptic states has been further evaluated by implementing an artificial neural network and achieved image recognition accuracies of approximately 95% and 87% on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively.

Associated repository: https://github.com/wqc1105/Fractal_tipping", "summary": "When parameters of a dynamical system change sufficiently fast, critical transitions can take place even in the absence of bifurcations. This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics.

Consequently, huge progress has been made toward the design of dual-function nanoplatforms that integrate heating and thermometry capabilities at the nanoscale. However, in most cases, dual nanoheater nanothermometer platforms rely either on specifically engineered materials or on complex readout schemes, which limits translational potential due to complex implementation procedures. To overcome these challenges, we present a methodology for directly extracting temperature information based on dynamical magnetization measurements of cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoflowers. We demonstrate that these nanocrystals monitor temperature changes through variations in their magnetization cycles measured under alternating magnetic fields. Importantly, this thermometric functionality is preserved after surface functionalization and under chemical variations in the nanoparticle environment. Interestingly, we show that we can simultaneously generate heat and report temperature changes within the same agent. This is thanks to the photothermal conversion of cobalt ferrite nanoparticles subjected to near infrared irradiation and the tight reported relationship between magnetization dynamics and Brownian relaxation. Together, these results establish cobalt ferrite magnetic nanoparticles as a label-free platform for simultaneous heat generation and intrinsic temperature readout, enabling real-time nanoscale thermal control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we study logical T-gate magic-state preparation in GKP-encoded photonic qubits using a repeat-until-success injection protocol combined with outer surface-code protection. We develop an architecture-level modeling framework based on a lightweight density-matrix simulator implemented with standard numerical linear algebra. Finite squeezing is mapped to effective logical dephasing, depolarizing noise is included at the logical level, and photon loss is treated as a heralded erasure process. This approach avoids explicit continuous-variable wavefunction simulation, hardware-specific photonic models, and quantum software frameworks, enabling transparent and computationally efficient exploration of architectural trade-offs. We perform systematic parameter sweeps over squeezing values from 8 to 16 dB, baseline loss probabilities between 0.01 and 0.03, and surface-code distances d = 1, 3, 5, and 7. Across this regime, we evaluate repeat-until-success probability, average injection overhead, and logical magic-state fidelity. We find that success probabilities exceed 0.94 across all studied parameters, with an average overhead close to unity. After outer-code protection, logical fidelities reach approximately 0.77 to 0.80 and show weak sensitivity to moderate photon loss but a strong dependence on squeezing. Phase-boundary analysis identifies minimum squeezing requirements needed to simultaneously achieve high success probability and logical fidelity.

We perform a Bayesian inference analysis by confronting theoretical NS mass-radius predictions with NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437+4715, and PSR J0614+3329.

However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06DMFT\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u66f4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5927\u7f29\u77edDMFT\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f7f\u7528g-RISB\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76DMFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5bf9\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83DMFT\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5(Hartree-Fock, Hubbard-I, RISB\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55g-RISB)\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11DMFT\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fg-RISB\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u589e\u52a0DMFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7g-RISB\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u83ab\u4f0a\u7279\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6781\u9650\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3DMFT\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

A nanobubble can have many stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers, $l$, within the cluster of internal atoms. The layers are circular in shape, concentrically stacked on top of each other, forming an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. The covering of this pyramid with a graphene sheet is achieved through its local stretching. The valence bonds of the sheet stretch only over the group of internal atoms; outside the coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum possible number of layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of atoms $N$ ($l_m=6$ for $N=4000$). The graphene sheet, interacting with the substrate, compresses the internal atom cluster against it, generating an internal pressure of $P\\sim 1$ GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations of a nanobubble, there is always one \"ground\"\\ state. Upon heating, this ground state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid state. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a certain temperature is reached (for $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to state with $l=4$). The coexistence of several stable states with different numbers of layers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$, can vary from 0 to 0.24, depending on the number of layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u886c\u5e95\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5229\u7528Ar\u3001Kr\u548cXe\u7b49\u7a00\u6709\u6c14\u4f53\u539f\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u5185\u90e8\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u6bcf\u5c42\u5747\u4e3a\u5706\u5f62\u5c42\u53e0\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u5c42\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u62c9\u4f38\u8986\u76d6\u6b64\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u5916\u5c42\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u4f38\u5c55\u5e76 flush \u8dc3\u8fc1\u81f3\u57fa\u5e95\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u76ee\u4e0e\u6c14\u6ce1\u5185\u90e8\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f53N=4000\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5c42\u6570lm=6\u3002\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5c42\u4e0e\u57fa\u5e95\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f7f\u5185\u90e8\u539f\u5b50Cluster\u53d7\u538b\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7ea61GPa\u5185\u90e8\u538b\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u632f\u52a8\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a'\u57fa\u6001'\u3002\u52a0\u70ed\u540e\uff0c\u57fa\u6001\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u65e0\u5c42\u7684\u6db2\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u7a33\u6001\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8fdb\u5165\u57fa\u6001\u3002\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u57fa\u6001\u5916\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u72b6\uff0cH/R\u6bd4\u503c\u4ece0\u52300.24\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u4e86\u89e3\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u819c\u751f\u957f\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u3001\u5c42\u6570\u548c\u538b\u529b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u632f\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6c14\u6ce1\u7684\u5f62\u8c8c\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5176\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5c42\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c42\u6570\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u5448\u6b63\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u591a\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u57fa\u6001\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6c14\u6ce1\u5f62\u8c8c\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7eb3\u7c73\u6c14\u6ce1\u7684\u591a\u7a33\u6001\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5916\u754c\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u539f\u5b50\u6570\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6717 -- \u6717\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Kulik"], "title": "Beyond the Training Domain: Robust Generative Transition State Models for Unseen Chemistry", "comment": null, "summary": "Transition states (TSs) govern the rates and outcomes of chemical reactions, making their accurate prediction a central challenge in computational chemistry. Although recent machine-learning models achieve near chemical accuracy in the prediction of TS structures and the associated reaction barriers for small organic reactions, their ability to generalize beyond the training domain remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce targeted benchmarks to probe chemical and structural novelty in generative TS prediction. Building on Transition1x, a large-scale dataset of reactions involving small organic molecules, we construct curated extensions incorporating controlled elemental substitutions and diverse transition-metal complexes (TMC). These benchmarks reveal fundamental limitations of generative models in the generalization to previously unseen elements. As a result, they produce unphysical geometries and large energetic errors, even for reactions structurally similar to well-predicted organic systems. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on equilibrium conformers that exposes generative TS models to novel chemical environments prior to targeted fine-tuning. Across the newly proposed benchmarks, self-supervised pretraining substantially improves TS prediction for previously unseen systems, lowering the median RMSD of TS geometries on T1x-TMC reactions from 0.39 to 0.19 $\\mathring{A}$ and reducing fine-tuning data requirements by up to 75%, enabling reliable performance even in low-data regimes. Overall, the integration of generative TS models with self-supervised pseudo-reaction pretraining provides an efficient, scalable, and chemically robust framework for elucidating TSs well beyond the small organic molecule domain, establishing a foundation for investigating complex and catalytically relevant reaction landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\uff08TS\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u53cd\u5e94\u80fd\u5792\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTS1x\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u6210\u6279\u548c\u591a\u91d1\u5c5e\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5143\u7d20\u7684TS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5927\u80fd\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6709\u673a\u53cd\u5e94\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728T1x-TMC\u53cd\u5e94\u4e0a\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86TS\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4ece0.39\u52300.19 \u00c5\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSD\uff09\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1175%\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5316\u5b66\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8fdc\u8d85\u5c0f\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684TS\uff0c\u4e3a\u50ac\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\u666f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u5e94\u80fd\u5792\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u6709\u673a\u53cd\u5e94\u7684TS\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u80fd\u5792\u65b9\u9762\u63a5\u8fd1\u5316\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u5efa\u4e86 TS1x \u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5143\u7d20\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86 TS1x \u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u589e\u6dfb\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u5143\u7d20\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u591a\u91d1\u5c5e\u590d\u5408\u7269\uff08TMC\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5316\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728 TS1x-TMC \u53cd\u5e94\u4e0a\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSD\uff09\u4ece 0.39 \u964d\u4f4e\u5230 0.19 \u00c5\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11 75%\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e73\u8861\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u8d85\u8fc7\u5c0f\u6709\u673a\u5206\u5b50\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u7684\u50ac\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\u666f\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63a2\u7d22\u50ac\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u590d\u6742\u53cd\u5e94\u666f\u89c2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In the presence of population inversion, this driven coherence sets the phase and temporal onset of the amplified field, while gain remains governed by conventional inner-shell lasing mechanisms. We refer to this operating regime as a resonant x-ray difference-frequency laser (re-XDFL).

The algebra of such operators has been used to calculate ratios of vacuum expectation values of local operators and to predict nontrivial particle-soliton degeneracies. In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation supported by variational and sum-rule methods, we show that the intraspin interaction ratio substantially alters the droplet's density profile, driving a transition from Gaussian-like to flat-top shapes. By examining two experimentally relevant parameter regions, we analyze density profiles, radii, peak densities, and excitation spectra to distinguish quantum phases and to depict phase diagrams in the space of asymmetric interaction ratio and total atom number. We carefully study the frequencies of both well-known dipole and breathing modes and less-explored spin dipole and spin breathing modes. The breathing mode frequency decreases monotonically with interaction ratio, approaching asymptotically the result of a conventional weakly interacting Bose gas. It varies non-monotonically with total atom number, peaking at a critical point that highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations.

This new parameter represents the intensity of an external gravitational field, which can be considered the hyperbolic generalisation of the Witten's bubble of nothing. No curvature or conical singularities are present outside the event horizon.

By analyzing both absorption and fluorescence spectra, we demonstrate that the optical response is dominated by a closed cycling transition, which effectively isolates the atomic dynamics to a two-level configuration despite the presence of multiple hyperfine states. This confinement-induced selection suppresses optical pumping into uncoupled states and enables robust, controllable light-matter interaction at telecom wavelengths within a miniature atomic platform.

Central to these advances are hyperbolic polaritons - nanometer-scale light-matter waves - spanning multiple energy-momentum dispersion orders with distinct mode profiles and incrementally high optical momenta. In this work, we report the mode conversion of hyperbolic polaritons across different dispersion orders by breaking the structure symmetry in engineered step-shape van der Waals (vdW) terraces. The mode conversion from the fundamental to high-order hyperbolic polaritons is imaged using scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) on both hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide (alpha-MoO3) vdW terraces. Our s-SNOM data, augmented with electromagnetic simulations, further demonstrate the alteration of polariton mode conversion by varying the step size of vdW terraces.

We present an angular-resolved reflectance measurement system developed at IFIC that operates in a gaseous argon atmosphere, enabling realistic measurements of detector materials under controlled conditions. The setup couples a deuterium lamp to a monochromator and employs a motorized PMT rotating around the sample to measure reflected light distributions across a wide angular range. We have characterized two key DUNE materials -- aluminum field cage profiles and stainless steel cryostat membranes -- in both the UV-VIS (300-500 nm) and VUV (128-200 nm) ranges. In the UV-VIS region, we confirm literature values of approximately 60% reflectance for aluminum and 40% for stainless steel. Preliminary VUV measurements at 45\u00b0 angle of incidence yield reflectance values of 10-15% for both materials, significantly lower than their UV-VIS counterparts.

When energy-momentum is identified through local translations rather than constant ones, a unique, symmetric, and gauge-invariant energy-momentum tensor emerges that satisfies a genuine off shell Noether identity without invoking the equations of motion. For the free electromagnetic field, this tensor coincides with the familiar Belinfante-Rosenfeld and Bessel-Hagen expressions, but arises here directly from spacetime-dependent translation symmetry rather than from improvement procedures or compensating gauge transformations. In interacting classical electrodynamics, comprising a point charge coupled to the electromagnetic field, diffeomorphism invariance yields well-defined energy-momentum tensors for the field and the particle, while the interaction term itself generates no independent local energy-momentum tensor.

Here we directly observe the energy excitation spectra of emergent CFTs at quantum phase transitions -- recovering universal energy ratios characteristic of the underlying field theories. Specifically, we develop and implement a modulation technique to resolve a Rydberg chain's finite-size spectra, variably tuned to quantum phase transitions described by either Ising or tricritical Ising CFTs. We also employ local control to distinguish parities of excitations under reflection and, in the tricritical Ising chain, to induce transitions between distinct CFT spectra associated with changing boundary conditions. By utilizing a variant of the modulation technique, we furthermore study the dynamical structure factor of the critical system, which is closely related to the correlation of an underlying Ising conformal field.

The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\u03c0(1 - 1 / \u03b2)$ with respect to the direction of the average electric field. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough.

Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns.

In this work, we study both adiabatic and nonadiabatic compression of PQSs in nonlinear optical fibers with pure quartic dispersion in the presence of distributed gain and loss. Within a variational framework, we show that, for weak constant gain, the adiabatic compression dynamics can be mapped onto the motion of an effective particle in a slowly deformed potential, providing an intuitive physical picture. To overcome the long propagation distance required by conventional adiabatic condition, we exploit shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) based on inverse engineering and derive analytical gain-loss profiles, with appropriate boundary conditions that realize a prescribed fast compression over a shorter propagation distance. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions and indicate a minimum propagation distance below which noticeable waveform distortion emerges.

Bromide co-adsorbates play a decisive role by guiding molecular alignment, inducing surface atom displacements, and enabling transient adsorption geometries that activate otherwise Raman-inactive vibrational modes. In the absence of bromide, distinct excitation pathways emerge, reflecting competition between optomechanical coupling and charge-transfer processes associated with molecular polarization along the optical field or orientation relative to the metal surface.

An analytic scaling solution for quantum gravity admits no free parameter for the mass term of the Higgs boson. If the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the renormalisation flow away from the fixed point is sufficiently below the Fermi scale, the couplings of the scale invariant standard model are determined by the scaling solution.

Achieving this level of control in a practical, scalable design remains, however, a major obstacle to mass societal adoption. By working at the level of interatomic bonding, molecular engineering has enabled exquisite control over the electronic properties of individual atoms and their interactions with neighboring atoms. This positions molecular electronics as a potentially disruptive quantum technology, but serious technological challenges have prevented it from being included in technical road maps. The main obstacle is that conventional, mass scalable nanodevice technologies utilize resists and solvents that can degrade molecules. Some approaches involve exposing junction interfaces to contaminants (e.g. air, resist etc...), which can be particularly problematic for spintronics. In this technical paper, we present our decade-long work into building a nanotechnological chain that can process entire metal/molecule heterostructures into vertical nanopillars electronic devices.

Relaxing the nondegeneracy condition i.e. considering a presymplectic form instead, extends the construction to non-topological models. The gauge-invariant action functional of (presymplectic) AKSZ sigma model is written in terms of space-time differential forms and can be seen as a covariant multidimensional analogue of the usual 1st order Hamiltonian action. In this work, we show that the AKSZ construction has a natural generalisation where the target space $Q$-manifold is equipped with a form of arbitrary degree $\u03a9$ (possibly inhomogeneous) which is $(\\mathrm{d}+L_Q)$-closed. This data defines a higher-derivative generalisation of the AKSZ action which is still invariant under the natural gauge transformations determined by $Q$ and which is efficiently formulated in terms of a version of Chern-Weil map introduced by Kotov and Strobl. It turns out that a variety of interesting gauge theories, including higher-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, MacDowell-Mansouri-Stelle-West action and self-dual gravity as well as its higher spin extension, can be concisely reformulated as such multisymplectic AKSZ models.

By mapping the plateau evolution versus THz strength, we show that even weak THz fields can extend the cutoff, producing a pronounced ``fish-fin'' structure whose prominent rays saturate near $I_p + 8 U_p$. We trace this extension to long electron excursions spanning several optical cycles before recombination, and provide a fully consistent explanation using both classical analysis and Bohmian trajectories flow. Our findings reveal that this cutoff-extension mechanism is remarkably robust, persisting across different atomic species and remaining insensitive to variations in the driving parameters.

For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $\u03b1$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents evidence for fractionalized excitations in \u03b1-RuCl\u2083 under a magnetic field.

This allows factorisation near zeros, including odd point channels described by an appropriately mass deformed NLSM + $\u03c6^3$ theory, and leads to a hidden zero based on-shell recursion for massive NLSM amplitudes.

In particular, quantum thermodynamical protocols for cooling can be significantly affected, potentially altering both their performance and efficiency. Analytically characterizing the impact of such errors becomes increasingly challenging as the system size grows, particularly in deep quantum circuits where noise can accumulate in complex ways. To address this, we introduce a general framework for approximating the cumulative effect of gate-dependent noise using a global depolarizing channel. We specify the regime in which this approximation provides a reliable description of the noisy dynamics. Applying our framework to the thermodynamical two-sort algorithmic cooling (TSAC) protocol, we analytically derive its asymptotic cooling limit in the presence of noise. Using the cooling limit, the optimal cooling performance is achieved by a finite number of qubits--distinguished from the conventional noiseless TSAC protocol by an infinite number of qubits--and fundamental bounds on the achievable ground-state population are derived. This approach opens new avenues for exploring noisy quantum thermodynamical processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using the semi-tetrad covariant formalism, we derive the dynamics of the collapsing fluid, including a master equation for the evolution of the Weyl curvature, to examine the role of viscosity. The analysis of null geodesic geometry uncovers a novel curvature-balance mechanism between Ricci (matter) and Weyl (free gravitational field) curvature on the apparent horizon; this balance determines the causal nature of the horizon and thereby governs the visibility of the singularity.

Van der Waals (vdW) metasurfaces have recently emerged as promising candidates for sustaining BICs and hybridizing with material transitions. However, the realization of flat-band BICs remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate polaritonic high-order BICs on a wide-angle flat band utilizing a subwavelength metasurface made of a vdW magnet CrSBr. The large oscillator strength of direct excitons in CrSBr enables near ultrastrong coupling with BICs, leading to strongly suppressed polaritonic angular dispersions. Remarkably, second-order polaritonic BICs become flat-band across a wide angular range, with corresponding Q factors exceeding 1500. Additionally, we find that these polaritonic BICs vanish in the transverse magnetic configuration, while leading to fascinating surface hyperbolic exciton-polaritons within the Reststrahlen band.

As an application, we study chaotic features of discretized many-body dynamics that can be detected by leveraging only demonstrated capabilities of globally-driven experiments, and benchmark their ability to discriminate chaotic evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u539f\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u5de5\u7a0b\u79bb\u6563\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Floquet\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u901a\u7528\u963b\u585e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5224\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u539f\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u539f\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u539f\u5b50\u6392\u5217\u548cFloquet\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u79cd\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec6\u80de\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5982\u88ab Kick-Ising \u6a21\u578b\u3001Floquet Kitaev \u6f5c Spike \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u963b\u585e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc\u79cd\u7fa4\u539f\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u6563\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Inspired by analogous concepts in quantum state discrimination, we introduce the unambiguous randomness of a quantum state and measurement, and, relaxing the assumption of perfect accuracy, randomness with a fixed rate of inconclusive outcomes. We solve these problems for any state and projective measurement in dimension two, as well as for an isotropically noisy state measured in an unbiased basis of any dimension. In the latter case, we find that, given a fixed amount of total noise, an eavesdropper correlated only to the noisy state is always outperformed by an eavesdropper with joint correlations to both a noisy state and a noisy measurement.

Here it is presented an ultrafast method that avoids solving large eigenproblems. Instead, only the dipolar component of the induced surface charge density \\((\u03c3_{dipolar})\\) is retained through a expansion into Cartesion dipole basis, yielding a compact $3\\times3$ geometric formulation that avoids full boundary-integral solves. The spectral response is obtained in a similar way, by projecting the Neumann--Poincar\u00e9 surface operator onto the dipole subspace and evaluating a Rayleigh quotient, giving geometry-only eigenvalues again without an $N\\times N$ eigenproblem. A major advantage of this method is that all geometry-dependent quantities are computed once per nanoparticle, while material dispersion and environmental changes enter only through simple algebraic expressions for the polarizability, enabling rapid evaluation across wavelengths.

Here, we demonstrate how the orientation of a nanomagnet relative to the direction of an applied electrical current impacts the threshold current density needed for all-electrical magnetization switching, and how dipolar coupling between the nanomagnets influences the switching of interacting pairs and ensembles of nanomagnets. Using a material system designed to generate SOTs in response to electrical currents, we find that the current required to switch the magnetization of isolated nanomagnets varies non-monotonically as the angle between the nanomagnet long axis and the current increases. In small artificial spin ice systems, we observe similar angular dependence of the switching current, which can be used to control the magnetization orientation of specific subsets of nanomagnets. These experimental results are supported by micromagnetic modeling, which illustrates how the various current induced torques can be exploited to control magnetization switching in nanomagnetic systems.

We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared.

In a previous paper we showed that, for an interacting scalar field theory in 1+1-dimensions, this formalism allows to capture numerically some crucial real-time features inaccessible to any Euclidean approach to lattice field theory. Yet, the new approach was plagued by two main limitations: an ill-defined non-interacting limit and the absence of a direct formal correspondence between its correlation functions and those generated by the Feynman path integral approach. In this paper, we introduce the new \\emph{\"constrained symplectic quantization\"} approach, for which the perfect equivalence with the Feynman path integral is proved and which is perfectly well defined for the free theory. This new approach is characterized by the analytical continuation of all fields and of the action from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$ and the presence of some constraints which guarantee the stability of the generalized Hamiltonian dynamics and the convergence of the corresponding generalized microcanonical partition function, hence the name of the theory. We show the application of this formalism to the quantum harmonic oscillator on a Minkowskian-time lattice, finding perfect agreement between one- and two-point numerical correlators and the exact quantum-mechanical results. We observe genuine real-time features such as the oscillatory propagator and the discrete excited-state energy spectrum.

Standard formulations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) impose such multi-channel constraints using penalty terms, so most of the explored Hilbert space corresponds to invalid assignments. We propose a subspace-confined QAOA tailored to CBRS multi-channel allocation, in which each node-wise channel register is initialized in a Generalized Dicke state and evolved under an intra-register XY mixer. This ansatz confines the dynamics to a tensor product of Johnson graphs that exactly encode per-node Hamming-weight constraints. For an 8-node CBRS interference graph with 24 qubits, the effective search space is reduced from the full Hilbert space of size $2^{24}$ to 2916 feasible configurations. Within this subspace, the algorithm converges rapidly to low-conflict assignments without large penalty coefficients. Simulations on instances with up to eight nodes show that the proposed ansatz achieves near-optimal conflict levels and consistently outperforms standard penalty-based QAOA and a greedy classical heuristic in terms of feasibility. Noise simulations with depolarizing channels further indicate that the constraint-preserving structure maintains a high feasibility ratio in NISQ-relevant error regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCBRS\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u91cf\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08QAOA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u8282\u70b9\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77405G\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u9891\u8c31\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u6d41\u91cf\u57fa\u7ad9\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8bbf\u95ee\u591a\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6807\u51c6QAOA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u6765\u9650\u5236\u591a\u4fe1\u9053\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9CBRS\u591a\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u9650QAOA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49Dick\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0XY\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u5f97\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53d7\u9650QAOA\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u60e9\u7f5a\u5f0fQAOA\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u591a8\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728NISQ\u8bef\u5dee\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728CBRS\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u53d7\u9650QAOA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4fe1\u9053\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Lobo"], "title": "Embedding Wormholes and Dyonic Black Strings in Warped Braneworlds via Local Sum Rules", "comment": "10 pages", "summary": "Building on our previous work [1], where the Local Sum Rules (LSR) were established, we investigate the construction of compact objects in Randall-Sundrum braneworlds supported by matter fields that are dynamically consistent and localizable. We begin by revisiting the Chamblin et al. black string, highlighting its role as a foundational higher-dimensional solution. We then show that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can be consistently embedded in this framework via a localized free scalar field, providing a simple yet nontrivial example of a braneworld compact object. Finally, we derive two novel black string solutions sourced by a localized nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) theory with Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{F}) = -\u03b2\\sqrt{\\mathcal{F}}$, corresponding to purely magnetic and dyonic configurations. The purely magnetic solution reproduces the classical Letelier string cloud on the brane, while the dyonic solution generalizes it to include electric charge, closely paralleling the Letelier-Alencar construction.

For all angles the lattice relaxation agrees well with continuum elastic models. For angles accessible to plane-wave DFT (VASP), we provide a detailed comparison with our local basis DFT (SIESTA) calculations, demonstrating excellent agreement in both the atomic and electronic structure. The dependence of the Fermi velocity and band width on the twist angle shows qualitative agreement with results from an `exact' $\\mathbf{k \\cdot p}$ continuum model, but reveals a small twist angle offset.

In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|\u03c8\\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $\u0398(e^{-\\mathcal{N}_2(\u03c8)})$, where $\\mathcal{N}_2(\u03c8)$ is the second R\u00e9nyi entanglement entropy of $|\u03c8\\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $\u03b1$-R\u00e9nyi entropeis, the second R\u00e9nyi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second R\u00e9nyi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Conventional models for simple bands often predict a vanishing magnetoresistivity from e-e interactions alone. In this work, we investigate magnetotransport in a gapless 6.3 nm HgTe quantum well, a hybrid 2D band system that hosts coexisting holes with both linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic energy bands. Focusing on the high temperature regime where particle-particle collisions dominate scattering, we observe significant corrections to both the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect. The high temperature transport coefficients are in good agreement with the theoretical model describing transport in massive-massless fermion mixtures governed by a frictional mechanism and intervalley scattering.

Existing training approaches largely rely on gradient-based procedural optimization, which often suffers from slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and instability near sharp minima. In this work, we propose an alternative inverse-probability algebraic learning framework for QNNs. Instead of updating parameters through incremental gradient descent, our method treats learning as a local inverse problem in probability space, directly mapping discrepancies between predicted and target Born-rule probabilities to parameter corrections via a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian. This algebraic update is covariant, does not require learning-rate tuning, and enables rapid movement toward the vicinity of a loss minimum in a single step. We systematically compare the proposed method with gradient descent and Adam optimization in both regression and classification tasks using a teacher-student QNN benchmark. Our results show that algebraic learning converges significantly faster, escapes loss plateaus, and achieves lower final errors. Under finite-shot sampling, the method exhibits near-optimal error scaling, while remaining robust against intrinsic hardware noise such as dephasing.

This has given rise to hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the quantum device performs only a small but vital part of the overall computation. Among these, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which combine a classical optimization procedure with quantum evaluation of a cost function, have emerged as particularly promising. However, barren plateaus and ill-conditioned optimization landscapes remain among the primary obstacles faced by VQAs, often leading to unstable convergence and high sensitivity to initialization. Motivated by this challenge, we investigate whether a purely classical remedy, standard L2 squared-norm regularization, can systematically stabilize hybrid quantum-classical optimization. Specifically, we augment the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) objective with a quadratic penalty proportional to the squared norm of the parameters, without modifying the quantum circuit or measurement process. Across all tested Hamiltonians, H2, LiH, and the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM), we observe improved performance over a broad window of the regularization strength.

The performance of quantum algorithms is often measured by their query complexity, which quantifies the number of oracle calls required to access the input. The main parameters determining the complexity of QLS solvers are the condition number $\u03ba$ and sparsity $s$ of the linear system, and the target error $\u03b5$. To date, the best known query-complexity lower bound is $\u03a9(\u03ba\\log(1/\u03b5))$, which establishes the optimality of the most recent QLS solvers. The original proof of this lower bound is attributed to Harrow and Kothari, but their result is unpublished. Furthermore, when discussing a more general lower bound including the sparsity $s$ of the linear system, it has become folklore that it should read as $\u03a9( \u03ba\\sqrt{s}\\log(1/\u03b5))$. In this work, we establish the rigorous lower bound capturing the sparsity dependence of QLS. We prove the lower bound of $\u03a9(\u03ba\\sqrt{s})$ for any quantum algorithm that solves QLS with constant error.

This perspective discusses the opportunities in leveraging QC to advance energy materials research and the challenges QC faces in solving complex and high-dimensional problems. We present cases on how QC, when combined with classical computing methods, can be used for the design and simulation of practical energy materials. We also outline the outlook for error-corrected, fault-tolerant QC capable of achieving predictive accuracy and quantum advantage for complex material systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This contrasts with the three-qubit scenario where many copies of biseparable states might be required for sharing genuine multipartite entanglement.

But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process is described by the so-called process tensor framework, which has been successfully used to study and characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems. But, although process tensors are motivated by an underlying dynamics, it is not a priori clear how to connect to a continuous process tensor object mathematically -- leaving an uncomfortable conceptual gap. In this work, we take a decisive step toward remedying this situation. We introduce a fully continuous process tensor framework by showing how the discrete multi-partite Choi state becomes a field-theoretic state in bosonic Fock space, which is intrinsically and rigorously defined in the continuum. With this equipped, we lay out the core structural elements of this framework and its properties. This translation allows for an information-theoretic treatment of multi-time correlations in the continuum via the analysis of their continuous matrix product state representatives. Our work closes a gap in the quantum information literature, and opens up the opportunity for the application of many-body physics insights to our understanding of quantum stochastic processes in the continuum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
