Likewise, active space selection is a key to\nunlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry.\nAlbeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully\nautomated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a\nwide range of molecular systems.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic\nValence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy\nanalysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of\nchemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme\nenables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while\nretaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of\nmolecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of\nRu(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation\nand structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due\nto the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate\nelectronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can\nreliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the\nessential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum\ncomputational frameworks.\n  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive\nto use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and\nquantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research\ncommunity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408AVAS\u548cAutoCAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8f68\u9053\u71b5\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Ru(II)\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5149\u52a8\u529b\u5149\u6cbb\u7597\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f3a\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408AVAS\u548cAutoCAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u9053\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u548c\u539f\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86 Active Space Selection \u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Ru(II)\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u7d27\u51d1\u800c\u5316\u5b66\u4e0a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6355\u6349\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u6210\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5305\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Tatarinov presented the foundations of the theory of weakly\nnonholonomic systems. Mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints\ndepending on a small parameter are considered. It is assumed that for zero\nvalue of this parameter the constraints of such a system become integrable;\ni.e., in this case, we have a family of holonomic systems depending on several\narbitrary integration constants.

To circumvent the computational burden of\ntracking singularities at finer and finer scale, we test this approach on\nfluids on log-lattices, which allow for high effective resolutions at a\nmoderate cost, while preserving the same symmetries and global conservation\nlaws as ordinary fluids. We observe a phase transition at a given efficiency,\nseparating regular, viscous solutions (hydrodynamic phase), from singular,\ninviscid solutions (singular phase). The singular solutions experience\nself-similar blow-ups with exponents corresponding to non-dissipative\nsolutions. By applying a stochastic regularization, we are able to go past the\nblow-up, and show that the resulting solutions converge to power-law solutions\nwith exponents characterizing dissipative solutions.

The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction\nwith limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp,\nunpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate.\nTo make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the\ntumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the\npursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied.\nNumerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions\nreveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled\nto adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely\nbefore the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to\npull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles\nforward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can\nsignificantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning\nwith the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the\ntarget motion.

Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their\ndefinition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative\ndefinite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing\nproposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery\nconjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a\nconstruction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this\nnote, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres\n$\\Sigma\\left(s,t,rst\\pm1\\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in\ngeneral. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\\text{eff}}$,\nwhich governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\\widehat{Z}$. First, we\nprove that the upper bound on $c_{\\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is\ngoverned by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery\nformula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower\nbounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing\nthis, we also study $c_{\\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds\nwhich allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by\norientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the\nsurgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between\n$c_{\\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections.\nThese findings underscore $\\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the \"positive\nside\" of $\\widehat{Z}$-theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86$\boxed{Z}$\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c plumbed 3\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u62df\u6a21\u548c mock \u6a21\u5f62\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b Brieskorn \u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c$\boxed{Z}$\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u76843\u6d41\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u522b\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7 extend $\boxed{Z}$ invariant \u5230\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684 plumbed 3\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a3\u6d41\u5f62\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684 extend \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u6548\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7535\u8377 $c_{\text{eff}}$ \u505a\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728 Brieskorn \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd extend \u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b Brieskorn \u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "$\boxed{Z}$ \u5728\u7814\u7a76 plumbed 3\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684 extend \u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u66f4\u52a0\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u5411\u7684 $\boxed{Z}$-\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

It is normally assumed that the\nwavefront distortion in these phase reference pulses is identical to the\nwavefront distortion in the quantum signals, which are multiplexed during\ntransmission. However, in many real-world deployments, there can exist a\nrelative wavefront error (WFE) between the reference pulses and quantum\nsignals, which, among other deleterious effects, can severely limit secure key\ntransfer in satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD. In this work, we introduce novel machine\nlearning-based wavefront correction algorithms, which utilize multi-plane light\nconversion for decomposition of the reference pulses and quantum signals into\nthe Hermite-Gaussian (HG) basis, then estimate the difference in HG mode phase\nmeasurements, effectively eliminating this problem. Through detailed\nsimulations of the Earth-satellite channel, we demonstrate that our new\nalgorithm can rapidly identify and compensate for any relative WFEs that may\nexist, whilst causing no harm when WFEs are similar across both the reference\npulses and quantum signals. We quantify the gains available in our algorithm in\nterms of the CV-QKD secure key rate.

Although QKD promises future-proof security, practical challenges\nstil exist due to imperfections in physical devices. Many protocols offer\nstrong security guarantees, but their implementation can be complex and\ndifficult. To bridge this gap, we present a practical and systematic framework\nfor implementing QKD, focused on the BB84 protocol but designed with broader\napplicability in mind. The article includes key concepts for device\ncalibration, synchronisation,optical alignment, and key post-processing. We\noutline a simple algorithm for key sifting that is easily implementable in\nhardware. Our results highlight the importance of selecting the temporal window\nto optimise both the key rate and the quantum bit error rate (QBER). In\naddition, we show that random sampling of the sifted key bits for error\nestimation yields more reliable results than sequential sampling. We also\nintegrate the Entrapped Pulse Coincidence Detection (EPCD) protocol to boost\nkey generation rates, further enhancing performance. Although our work focuses\non BB84, the techniques and practices outlined are general enough to support a\nwide range of QKD protocols.

We apply this model to three\ncanonical quantum computing experiments: GHZ state parity measurements,\nbranch-mass entanglement tests, and Grover's search to generate distinctive\ncollapse signatures that differ qualitatively from constant-rate dephasing. The\nresulting patterns serve as a baseline reference: if future hardware\nexperiments exhibit the same scaling trends under ideal isolation, this could\nindicate a contribution from mass-dependent collapse processes.

To address this challenge, we\nfirst introduce a novel metric, namely Maximum Number of Affected Requests\n(maxNAR), to quantify the worst-case impact of a single physical-layer attack,\nand then we investigate a new problem of Routing and Wavelength Assignment with\nMinimal Attack Radius (RWA-MAR). We formulate the problem using an Integer\nLinear Programming (ILP) model and propose a scalable heuristic to efficiently\nminimize maxNAR. Our approach incorporates key caching through Quantum Key\nPools (QKPs) to enhance resilience and optimize resource utilization.

Examples include superconducting quantum sensors, atom\ninterferometry, and quantum spin sensors. They are mainly motivated by\nindustrial applications toward quantum computing, secure quantum communication\nsystems, and high-sensitivity sensors. Given the excellent potential of the new\nquantum measurement systems, there are also new proposals to apply them in\nparticle physics and cosmology.
