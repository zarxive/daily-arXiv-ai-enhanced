In this work, we enhance the capabilities of\nTurboGAP for radiation damage simulations by implementing a two-temperature\nmolecular dynamics model, based on electron density-dependent coupling of\nelectronic and atomic subsystems. Additionally, we implement adaptive\ncalculation of the timestep and grouping of atoms for cell-border cooling.

By combining the computational efficiency of TurboGAP with the accuracy\nof GAP MLIP, we perform cascade simulations in silicon with primary knock-on\natom (PKA) energies up to 10 keV. Our simulations scale to systems containing\nup to 1 million atoms. We study the generation and clustering of\nradiation-induced defects.

It has traditionally been\nconfined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet,\neach requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the\nnature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented\nin the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical\nrectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection,\nboth using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen\nband near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz,\nboth linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high\ndispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS\noperation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and\neffectively separating the THz and MIR domains. Here we demonstrate\nhigh-resolution DCS performed simultaneously over two broad spectral bands,\neach spanning an octave or more. The measurements cover both the MIR (350-1150\ncm$^{-1}$; 8.7-28.5 $\\mu$m; 10.5-34.5 THz) and the THz region (80-160\ncm$^{-1}$; 62.5-125 $\\mu$m; 2.4-4.8 THz), effectively bridging these\ntraditionally separate regions within a single acquisition. This enables direct\ncross-referencing of molecular absorption line strengths across widely\nseparated spectral domains. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the\nsimultaneous acquisition of ro-vibrational and pure rotational absorption\nspectra of ammonia (NH$_3$) with a spectral resolution of 7.3 MHz (0.00024\ncm$^{-1}$), sufficient to fully resolve Doppler-broadened line shapes across\nthe entire measured spectral range."}

We show that the CFT\ncan only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS\nsatisfies a certain criterion. Namely, there must exist a scalar field\ntrajectory that follows the gradient of the scalar potential to the asymptotic\nregion of the scalar field space in which limit $V\\sim m^\\alpha$, where\n$\\alpha\\leq 2$ is a constant and $m$ is the mass scale of the lightest tower of\nstates.

However, the\ninterpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles\nremains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of\norbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons\nand phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in\nbosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion\nof the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the\nlatter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional\nantiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum\ngeometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking,\nyielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM.\nWe propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage\ngenerated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the\nbosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the\nemerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge\nbetween phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding\nmagnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital\ndegrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical\ncontrol of magnetization and phononic transport."}

Remarkably, at finite temperature this wavefunction can acquire a\nphase that increases linearly with the size of operator, a phenomenon called\n$\\textit{size winding}$. Although size winding occurs naturally in a\nholographic setting, the emergence of a coherent phase in a scrambled operator\nremains mysterious from the standpoint of a thermalizing quantum many-body\nsystem. In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related\nconcept of $\\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a\nphase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding\nis a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding\nunder two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and\nsize bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and\n(ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\\lambda_L \\leq 2\n\\alpha$ (with $\\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\\alpha$ the growth rate),\nwhich ensures a linear phase dependence on size.

Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model,\nwhich is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles.

We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a\nquantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models.\nBased on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure\nfactors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with\nrespect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong\nspectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in\nthe antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we\npropose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond\noperators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior\ndisappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is\nconsistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the\ntemperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the\nzero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature\nincreases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of\nspinons.

All entanglements with\nideal nonreciprocity can be achieved by tuning the photon frequency detuning,\nappropriately choosing the cavity-magnon coupling regime, the nonlinear gain,\nand the phase shift of the OPA. Interestingly, the amount of entanglement\nnonreciprocity and its resilience to thermal occupation are remarkably enhanced\nby increasing the gain of the OPA. This nonreciprocity can be significantly\nenhanced even at relatively high temperatures. Our research offers a pathway\nfor the realization of nonreciprocal single-phonon devices, with potential\napplications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. This\nproposed scheme could pave the way for the development of novel nonreciprocal\ndevices that remain robust under thermal fluctuations."}

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and\nquantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a\none-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field\napproach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is\nsimultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard\ninteraction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from\nan anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This\nmagnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a\nquantized jump in the Zak phase from $\\pm\\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute\nthe phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering\n($\\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\\lambda$), revealing the\ncritical interaction strength $U_c$.

Combining\nphenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge\ndensity-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide\nparameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and\naltermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split\nfingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order.

We show that the CFT\ncan only decouple from gravity if the scalar potential in the dual AdS\nsatisfies a certain criterion.

Building on\nthese investigations, we introduce a hybrid Kitaev chain in which the lattice\nis partitioned into two segments: the left segment comprises nearest-neighbor\ncouplings, while the right segment incorporates long-range pairing. To probe\nthe role of the interface, we study two scenarios: a decoupled (suppressed\nhopping) case, where the segments are isolated, and a coupled case, where they\nare connected via interface hopping that enables coherent tunneling. Using this\nsetup, we investigate the behavior of Majorana zero modes at the interface\nbetween the two segments, finding that in the decoupled case, Majorana zero\nmodes remain sharply localized at the left segment chain edges while massive\nDirac modes remain in right segment chain edges, with their energies and\nlocalization strongly dependent on the long-range pairing exponent. Introducing\na finite interface coupling enables coherent transfer of Majorana zero modes\nfrom the edges of the left segment to those of the right segment of the chain.\nWe characterize this dynamics by the fidelity of state transfer, dynamical\nrotation, and inverse participation ratio. We show the signature of MZM\ntransfer across the interface by the spatiotemporal profile of the probability\ndistribution of the time evolved state."}

We address this by treating\nself-fidelity (survival probability) as a random variable on projective state\nspace and adopting the Pearson correlation coefficient as a device-agnostic\nmeasure of global opposition between two evolutions. Within this framework we\nestablish the following theorem: For any nontrivial pair of unitaries,\nself-fidelity maps cannot be point-wise complementary correlation on the entire\nstate space. Consequently, the mathematical lower edge of the correlation bound\nis not physically attainable, which we interpret as a unitary-geometric floor\non anti-contrast, independent of hardware specifics and noise models. We make\nthis floor explicit in realizable settings.

Directional couplers, which are\ncrucial building blocks for integrated quantum logic gates, are particularly\nprone to such limitations, with strong dependence on geometric and spectral\nparameters which reduces gate fidelity. Here, we demonstrate that composite\nsegmented directional couplers (CSDC) offer a fabrication-tolerant alternative\nthat enhances gate fidelity without active tuning. We design and fabricate a\nfully integrated photonic controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate using both uniform and\ncomposite coupler variants and compare their performance via simulation,\nclassical characterization, and quantum two-photon interference. The composite\ndesign reduces the average error probability by nearly a factor of two and\ndecreases variability fivefold. The residual error is primarily limited by\nphoton indistinguishability. Classical matrix reconstruction confirms improved\nagreement with the ideal CNOT operation. These results establish CSDCs as\ncompact, passive, and foundry-compatible building blocks for robust scalable\nquantum photonic circuits."}

Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity,\nmutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and\nself-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal\nentanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be\ncapable of detecting the first-order and $\\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ\nmodel, as well as the Ising and $\\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In\naddition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the\nBeresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed\nthrough concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably,\nthe critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional\npoints as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases.

Exploring this\ninterplay is essential to understand how strong interactions and dissipation\ncollectively shape topological phases in open quantum systems. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate non-Hermitian spectra topology in a dissipative\nRydberg atomic gas and characterize parameters-dependent winding numbers. By\nincreasing the interaction strength, the system evolves from Hermitian to\nnon-Hermitian regime, accompanying emergence of trajectory loop in the complex\nenergy plane. As the scanning time is varied, the spectra topology becomes\ntwisted in the complex energy plane manifesting as a topology phase transition\nwith the sign winding number changed. When preparing the system in different\ninitial states, we can access a nontrivial fractional phase within a parameter\nspace that globally possesses an integer winding. Furthermore, by changing the\nscanning direction, we observe the differentiated loops, revealing the breaking\nof chirality symmetry. This work establishes cold Rydberg gases as a versatile\nplatform for exploring the rich interplay between non-Hermitian topology,\nstrong interactions, and dissipative quantum dynamics."}
