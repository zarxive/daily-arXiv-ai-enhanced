After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate.\n  FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature.\n  Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy.

Warsaw, September 15-19 , 2025", "summary": "Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches.

While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Abstract describes the analysis of brain connectomes across five species revealing that distance-dependent connectivity, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment generate key structural properties of brain networks.", "motivation": "Understanding how complex brain networks evolve across species and identifying universal principles is critical for advancing neuroscience and comparative cognition.", "method": "Single-neuron resolution connectomes from C.

Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $\u03bc$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian.

The results highlight the importance of mutual polarization for capturing specific solute-solvent interactions, particularly in systems where hydrogen bonding or directional interactions play a dominant role.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408DMRG\u548cFQ\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6eb6\u5242\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u6eb6vchecksum.to tasty shifts\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u89e3\u79bb\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5728\u6eb6\u6db2\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u5f3a\u70c8\u9759\u6001\u5171\u8f6d\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5c06DMRG\uff08\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6b63\u5316\u7ec4\uff09\u4e0eFQ\uff08\u53ef\u6781\u5316\u7684\u6392\u65a5\u7535\u8377\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u3002DMRG\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9759\u6001\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800cFQ\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66/\u5206\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\uff08QM/MM\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6eb6\u5242\u6781\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6eb6\u5242\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u6eb6vchecksum.to tasty shifts\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u53cc\u65b9\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u6eb6\u8d28-\u6eb6\u5242\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u6c22\u952e\u6216\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DMRG\u548cFQ\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6eb6\u8d28-\u6eb6\u5242\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002DMRG\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9759\u529b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800cFQ\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6eb6\u5242\u6781\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u53cc\u65b9\u6781\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u5982\u6c22\u952e\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u79bb\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86DMRG\u548cFQ\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u6eb6\u5242\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5178\u578b\u6eb6\u8d28-\u6eb6\u5242\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89e3\u79bb\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ee7\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The measurements were performed using a homemade optical nanocell filled with atomic cesium and featuring a wedge-shaped gap between the inner surfaces of sapphire windows. For atom-surface distances below approximately $300$\\,nm, a significant red shift of the atomic transition frequency is observed due to van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the dielectric surface. An additional red shift arises at high vapor pressures owing to Cs-Cs interactions, with a measured contribution of $15$\\,MHz/Torr, which must be accounted for in order to correctly determine the vdW coefficient $C_3$. By recording transmission spectra of the nanocell at different thicknesses, we determine for the first time the vdW coefficient for the Cs $6S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ transition, obtaining values in the range $C_3 \\sim 2- 20$\\,kHz\\,$\u03bc$m$^3$.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\\sim(\u03b3H^{2}+g(H))^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Fractional Holographic Dark Energy\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u5982rip\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6807\u5c3a\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u5947\u70b9\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9650\u5236\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5947\u70b9\u53d1\u751f\u673a\u5236\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6807\u5c3a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5947\u70b9\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u5c3a\u7684Granda-Oliveros\u548cHubble\u6807\u5c3a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u5e73\u65b9\u58f0\u901f\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f7f\u7528Granda-Oliveros\u6807\u5c3a\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53L\u00e9vy\u6307\u6570\u03b1\u57281\u52302\u4e4b\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u5b87\u5b99\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u751f\u5927rip\u548c\u4f2arip\uff1b\u800c\u8d85\u8fc72\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2arip\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Hubble\u6807\u5c3a\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684Q\u53c2\u6570\u624d\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5c0frip\u548c\u4f2arip\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b87\u5b99\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6807\u5c3a\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6761\u4ef6\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet.

The application of electric fields induces anisotropic spin textures, as evidenced by the magnon resonance spectra and spin-current measurements.

For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution\" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle\" $\u03b8$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u63a5\u89e6\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u5f62\u6210\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u4e0e\u786c\u58c1\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u80fd\u65f6\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eLee\u548cPine\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9ad8\u80fd\u65f6\u7528Born-Oppenheimer\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f97\u51fa\u6563\u5c04\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9ad8\u80fd\u65f6\u79bb\u89e3\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u6563\u5c04\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u79bb\u89e3\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u548c\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u76f8\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 Born-Oppenheimer \u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u80fd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 semiclass \u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u79bb\u89e3\u6982\u7387\u548c\u79bb\u89e3\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u80fd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0eLee\u548cPine\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u9ad8\u80fd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Born-Oppenheimer\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6563\u5c04\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u9ad8\u80fd\u65f6\u79bb\u89e3\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u6563\u5c04\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u79bb\u89e3\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u89d2\u03b8\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79bb\u89e3\u7c92\u5b50\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u533a\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u805a\u4f53\u4e0e\u786c\u58c1\u78b0\u649e\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\\pm \\ell \\hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings.

In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\\langle T \\rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2\u03c0/12$ as expected: $-2\u03c0/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2\u03c0/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2\u03c0/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\\langle T^m \\rangle$.

However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity.

Romero-Figueroa", "Hernando Quevedo"], "title": "Quasi-Homogeneous Thermodynamics and Microscopic Structure of the Quantum-Corrected FLRW Universe", "comment": null, "summary": "The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems.

Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state.

Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\\lesssim D\\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u5206\u5f62\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5b87\u5b99\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u6570\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6162\u6362\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u8fd8\u6784\u67b6\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5206\u5f62\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684Mukhanov-Sasaki\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u52a8\u91cf\u8c31\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u80fd\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e0ePlanck 2018\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u60f3\u5230\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06\u5206\u5f62\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5165\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5bf9\u5b87\u5b99\u65e9\u671f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Friedmann \u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u6570 $D$\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 cubic\u3001Starobinsky \u548c\u81ea\u7136\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6162\u6362\u5355\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u52a8\u91cf\u9879 $k_{eff}$\uff0c\u6269\u5c55Mukhanov-Sasaki\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5206\u5f62\u5bf9\u6807\u91cf\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u6162\u6362\u5355\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5206\u5f62\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u65b0Mukhanov-Sasaki\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u52a8\u91cf\u8c31\u548c\u80fd\u8c31\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e0ePlanck\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5f97\u51fa\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5f62\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u5f62\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ecd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f20\u7edf\u503c\u3002"}}

To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We study a Job Shop Scheduling instance using a two-parameter family of encodings controlled by penalty weights $p_{\\rm sum}$ (one-hot/sum constraints) and $p_{\\rm pair}$ (precedence constraints). Sweeping $(p_{\\rm sum},p_{\\rm pair})$, we observe sharp transitions in feasibility and solver success across classical annealing-inspired heuristics and on a D-Wave Advantage processor. Going beyond solution probability, we treat the annealer as an open thermodynamic system and perform cyclic reverse-annealing experiments initialized from thermal samples, measuring the stochastic processor energy change. From the first two moments of this energy change we infer lower bounds on entropy production, work, and exchanged heat via thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and corroborate the observed trends with adiabatic master equation simulations. We find that the same encoding transitions that govern computational hardness also reorganize dissipation: weak penalties generate low-energy infeasible manifolds, while overly strong penalties suppress the effective problem energy scale and increase irreversibility, reducing the thermodynamic efficiency.

Konotop"], "title": "Half-vortex soliton lattices in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates with a quasi-flat band", "comment": "8 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Periodic potentials with flat bands in their spectra support strongly localized nonlinear excitations. Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability.

Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity.

It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies how small or strong perturbations affect the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations, such as those from compact objects or accretion disks.

While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\\cal P}{\\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs.

Among its key performance metrics especially for time-resolved studies, sensitivity and measurement speed are paramount. However, a long-standing compromise between these parameters arises from the need for noise reduction. Here, we introduce a comb spectroscopy system that overcomes this limitation using a single frequency comb of non-uniformly spaced modes. The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability.

Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 \u03a9 and 10 k\u03a9), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency. These results establish silicon-photonic OEO converters as compact, foundry-compatible building blocks for scalable optoelectronic computing and optical neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7845\u5149\u5b50OEO\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0cOEO\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u90e8\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7845\u5149\u5b50 fabrication\u5382\u81ea\u5bb6\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u52a0\u8f7d-\u7535\u963b\u5668\u548c\u7535\u6d41\u6ce8\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5404\u81ea\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9517\u5149\u7535\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\u5fae\u73af\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5728\u9ad8\u589e\u76ca\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u589e\u76ca\u968fMRM\u504f\u7f6e\u529f\u7387\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8d85\u8fc71\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u8303\u56f4\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u504f\u7f6e\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u9002\u7528\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u773c\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ey\u56fe\u57284 Gbps\u4e0b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u9ad8\u4f20\u8f93\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5728\u529f\u8017\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u76ae\u79d2/\u4f4d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7845\u5149\u5b50OEO\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

We implement TN-Sim, a tensor network simulator backend within the NWQ-Sim software package that utilizes the Tensor Algebra for Many-body Methods (TAMM) framework to support both distributed HPC-scale computations and local simulations with ITensor. To optimize the scale up in computation across multiple nodes we implement a task based parallelization scheme to demonstrate parallelized gate contraction for wide quantum circuits with many gates per layer. Through the integration of the TAMM framework with Matrix Product State (MPS) tensor network approaches, we deliver a simulation environment that can scale from local systems to HPC clusters. We demonstrate an MPS tensor network simulator running on the state-of-the-art Perlmutter (NVIDIA) supercomputer and discuss the potential portability of this software to HPC clusters such as Frontier (AMD) and Aurora (Intel).

By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1.

The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent.

A sharp transition band is critical for precise spectral shaping and interference suppression, yet conventional MWP filters face challenges in achieving both sharp transitions and high reconfigurability. Adaptive MWP filters with sharp transition based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source are demonstrated in this paper. Four different types of single-band MWP filters with roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15 are achieved. In addition, simply through designing tap coefficients, band-pass filters with tunable centre frequencies ranging from 5 GHz to 15 GHz and dual-band MWP filters with various filter response are demonstrated without changing any hardware, where sharp transition is also validated.

However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths.

The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels.

FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \\textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode.

[1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e[1]\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e07\u7269\u573a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u5fc5\u987b\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u9a8c\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u8bba\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u518d\u52a0\u4e0a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6240\u6709\u573a\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c40\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4ec5.", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u5bf9\u5f26\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u819c\u6a2a\u5411\u573a\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u63a8\u5bfc\u5c40\u57df\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7535\u78c1\u5b66\u4e2d\u53ea\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5141\u8bb8\u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u573a\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c40\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons. At the output, photons are spatially resolved on different regions of a time-resolved single-photon-sensitive detector, enabling the reconstruction of coincidence maps in the Fourier plane.

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\u03c1_{\\rm vac}=\u03c1_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\u039b$). In the FLRW epoch, $\u03c1_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\u039b\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\u03b4\u03c1_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u201c\u5047\u60f3\u7269\u201d\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3aRVM-\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u6548\u5e94\u9a71\u52a8\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u66b4\u80c0\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5047\u60f3\u7269\uff08\u5373\u201c inflaton\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0d\u591f\u6ee1\u610f\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5728Running vacuum\u6a21\u578b\uff08RVM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u771f\u7a7a\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u54c8\u52c3\u53c2\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u66b4\u80c0\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cRVM-\u81a8\u80c0\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u039b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7269\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u66b4\u80c0\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u51c6\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u4e86QFT\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry. The lifetime difference between left- and right-circularly polarized excitations exhibits a field-angle dependence, consistent with spin precession driven by the transverse magnetic-field component relative to the chiral axis.

Recently, advances in nonlinear flat optics have opened a novel pathway for converting IR signals into the visible through nonlinear generations, enabling the direct visualisation of IR images using standard visible cameras. However, the narrow spectral bandwidth and the requirement for an additional lens remain the key challenges. Here, we address both issues via a novel adaptive and multifunctional IR-to-visible imaging platform offering tunable bandwidth and focusing simultaneously. We utilise sum-frequency generation (SFG) to convert IR light into the visible, by introducing a pump beam modulated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) to construct a virtual metalens enabling precisely controlled focusing of the generated nonlinear optical field. As a result, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally an optical focusing mechanism with a tunable focal length, achieved by varying the pump and signal wavelengths and modulating the phase distribution. Furthermore, since the focal length depends on the input signal wavelength, the imaging plane position varies accordingly, indicating a promising potential for the multispectral IR imaging applications.

Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins. These methods are general and can be applied to any implementation of the COW protocol.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement.

Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory.

Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which both energy and angular momentum transfer are maximized when the Weyl node separations are antiparallel rather than parallel.

These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\u00fcckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase.

Although many such materials appear similarly dark under diffuse illumination, their reflectance behavior can differ substantially as a function of viewing and lighting geometry. Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive assessment of black materials that links reflectance properties to visual appearance and perceptual performance, enabling informed material selection for optical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper evaluates various black materials used in optical applications by measuring their reflectance and visual properties, aiming to find the best materials for applications like image registration.", "motivation": "The study is motivated by the need for more reliable and affordable alternatives to ultra-black materials like Vantablack, which are expensive and fragile.", "method": "The research employs a gonimetric measurement system to capture the reflectance distribution of different black materials, including Vantablack, black velvet, and black coatings.

We implement a Ramsey sequence that maps phonon-number-dependent phases onto the spin, thereby realizing a multimode spin-dependent rotation (SDR). We also introduce a selective-decoupling scheme that cancels the phase induced by the carrier AC-Stark shift while preserving the phonon-number-dependent phase induced by the dispersive shift.

A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems.

Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified.

Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip.

A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{\u03c3,\u0394t}=e^{-iH\u0394t}\\,e^{-\\frac12\u03c3^2\u0394t^2H^2}$, i.e.\\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(\u03c3\u0394t)$.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes PACOX, an FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation, achieving 100x speedups and lower energy usage compared to CPUs.", "motivation": "Pauli strings are essential in quantum-classical algorithms, and their efficient computation is crucial for performance, especially with many qubits.", "method": "PACOX uses compact binary encoding, XOR-based index permutation, and phase accumulation, combined with a parallel and pipelined PE architecture.", "result": "Experiments show PACOX operates at 250 MHz, consuming 0.33 W, and efficiently computes Pauli strings up to 19 qubits.", "conclusion": "PACOX significantly improves the performance and energy efficiency of computing Pauli strings, making it suitable for hybrid quantum-classical systems."}}

Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that.

We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise.

In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.

Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator.

This equilibrium paradigm imposes intrinsic limitations: sensitivity is tied to long-time thermalization and often cannot be improved in fast, noisy, or nonstationary settings. In contrast, the \\textit{Mpemba effect}, the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter states relax faster than colder ones, has mostly been viewed as a thermodynamic anomaly. Here, we bridge this gap by proving that Mpemba-type inversions generically yield a finite-time enhancement of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation, thereby converting an anomalous relaxation effect into a concrete metrological resource. Through explicit analyses of two-level and $\u039b$-level probes coupled to bosonic baths, we show that nonequilibrium initializations can transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies and colder states, realizing a \\emph{metrological Mpemba effect}.

In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17 code, we generalize the construction to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. The proposed encoding relies only on geometrically local gates, and is therefore fully compatible with planar 2D qubit connectivity, and it achieves circuit depth scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(d)$, consistent with fundamental entanglement-generation bounds. We design explicit stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyze their error-propagation behavior. Numerical simulations under depolarizing noise show that our unitary encoding without ancillas outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. These results make the scheme particularly relevant for platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, where measurements are costly relative to gates and idling noise is considerably weaker than gate noise.

Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame.

This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \\leq t_{\\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\\log(t/\\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Majorana\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8eHamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76Hamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Majorana\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Trotter\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Majorana\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Majorana\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Majorana\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u4f4e\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u627e\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u5f53Hamiltonian\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u56db\u6b21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6a21\u62dfHamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5373$N^{O(\text{log}(t/\text{ }\text{epsilon}))}$\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6$u$\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u65f6\u95f4$t_{\text{max}}(u)$\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Majorana\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Hamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u56db\u6b21\u578bHamiltonian\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5c0f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684Hamiltonian\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "A scalable pulse-level control framework is introduced to suppress XY crosstalk errors in superconducting quantum processors.
