This gravitational framework accounts for a massive graviton while ensuring the absence of ghost instabilities during propagation. The BEC stellar configuration in this study was obtained by determining the solutions characterized by static and spherical symmetric metric. This study provides a detailed account of the stellar structure, highlighting the roles played by massive gravity and the Kuchowicz metric through a combination of analytical and numerical solutions. Our work specifically utilizes the Colpi-Wasserman-shapiro (CWS) and Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations of state (EoS) to model the internal thermodynamic behavior of the BEC. We have evaluated the physical viability of the BEC stellar framework by analyzing the energy conditions, and the EoS parameter along with the gradients of the energy-momentum tensor. The stability criteria such as the study of surface redshift, adiabatic index and squared sound velocity were utilized to confirm that our proposed model is both stable and physically consistent.

While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86Niates\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u4ef7\u5c42\u7535\u5b50\u6db2\u7684\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u8d85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7RIXSS\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u770b\u5230\u4e86Ni03O\u2044\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53\u7684\u6563\u6591\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4Curates\u7684\u7f13\u548c\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5e93\u4ed1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5c4f\u853d\u3002\u6e29\u5ea6\u5347\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0cNiates\u7684\u6563\u6591\u4f1a\u53d8\u8f6f\uff0c\u4e0eCurates\u76f8\u53cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Niates\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5c4f\u853d\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7c7b\u6bd4Curates\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4ef7\u5c42\u7535\u5b50\u6db2\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u673a\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u6750\u6599\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5171\u632f\u4e0d\u9971\u548cX\u5c04\u7ebf\u6563\u5c04(RIXSS)\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Na4Ni3O8\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f53\u7684\u6563\u6591\u3002", "result": "Niates\u4e2d\u7684\u6563\u6591\u4e0eCurates\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5982\u66f4\u7f13\u548c\u7684\u6563\u6591\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u65f6\uff0c\u6563\u6591\u4f1a\u53d8\u8f6f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cNiates\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7535\u8377\u5c4f\u853d\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76Curates\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

As a fundamental step, we derive analytical Green's functions for the displacement and stress fields generated by a point load traveling at a constant velocity along the surface, explicitly incorporating elastodynamic effects through Mach number dependence. These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u89e3\u6790\u4e86\u5e73\u9762\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u4ecb\u8d28\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u79fb\u52a8\u8868\u9762\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u529b\u573a\u548c\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u5012\u7f6e\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u9006\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u8868\u9762\u526a\u5207\u529b\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u521a\u6027\u8f66\u8f6e-\u5730\u9762\u63a5\u89e6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u526a\u5207\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u573a\u95ed\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u53cc\u5bf9\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4e3b\u5e94\u529b\u5dee\u5f02\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9a6c\u8d6b\u6570\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ec5\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u8bba\u6587\u610f\u56fe,\u65e0\u9700\u8be6\u7ec6\u9610\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u57df\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9006\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u6790\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u534a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u529b\u573a\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u53cc\u5bf9\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u51fa\u73b0\u3002main stress difference\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u9762\u534a\u65e0\u9650\u4ecb\u8d28\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8868\u9762\u8f7d\u8377\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality.

Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective.

This modification causes the parameter to vary according to the system's history throughout the simulation. Previous works usually modify the Rulkov model by introducing additional parameters altering its behavior. Here, by contrast, we retain the original equations and allow the control parameters to vary in time, thereby preserving the model's fundamental properties. In this sense, the proposed model is locally equivalent in time to the original one. However, unlike the original model, which reproduces a single neuronal regime per simulation, the new memristive version exhibits both uniform and chaotic transitions among multiple neuronal activity regimes. Its dynamics are examined with respect to the rate at which the memristive function changes and the number of internal states it stores. Three distinct scenarios emerge around a bifurcation point. Before the bifurcation, the system undergoes uniform transitions toward a stable bursting regime. After the bifurcation, it shows uniform transitions toward a final spiking or silent regime. At the bifurcation point, highly complex transitions arise. As examples, we present trajectories in which the neuron chaotically switches between regimes without ever settling, and trajectories for which it requires around 140000 map iterations to reach a stationary regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06Rulkov\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684 memristive sigmoid \u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u968f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5386\u53f2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165 memristive \u51fd\u6570\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u5747\u5300\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u91c7\u7528 Rulkov \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a memristive sigmoid \u51fd\u6570\uff1b2. \u5206\u6790\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5747\u5300\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fc7\u6e21\uff1b3. \u8003\u5bdf memristive \u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u901f\u7387\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165 memristive \u51fd\u6570\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u539f\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282 memristive \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6d3b\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7 memristive \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Although formal monotonicity of the Hawking mass under smooth inverse mean curvature flow is well established in the Riemannian setting, comparatively little is known about the robustness of this behavior in discrete numerical implementations applied to explicitly embedded surfaces away from exact symmetry. We consider surfaces defined by small spherical harmonic perturbations of a round sphere and evolve them under an in-slice, time-flat flow analogous to inverse mean curvature flow. We examine the behaviour of the Hawking mass under the flow and find that monotonicity persists for a class of nonspherical perturbations and is robust under variations in perturbation amplitude and angular frequency. We also identify regimes in which numerical instabilities arise, highlighting practical challenges associated with extending such flows beyond simple symmetry assumptions. These results provide a concrete computational testbed for future investigations of uniformly expanding flows and quasi-local mass in more general spacetime settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u95ed\u66f2\u9762\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u6d41\u4e0b\uff0c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5149\u6ed1\u53cd\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u6d41\u4e0b\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8fdc\u79bb\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u5c0f\u7403\u8c10\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5706\u7403\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5c55\u7684\u6d41\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u4e00\u7c7b\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u662f\u5355\u8c03\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u89d2\u9891\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u63d0\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u5230\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u65f6\u6240\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5747\u5300\u81a8\u80c0\u6d41\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u9762\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5c55\u7684\u81a8\u80c0\u6d41\uff0c\u5bf9\u5c0f\u7403\u8c10\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5706\u7403\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff08\u5982\u7403\u8c10\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u7387\uff09\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u5355\u8c03\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u6563\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u65bd\u74e6\u8328child\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u65e9\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u5148\u7f16\u5199\u597d\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u534f\u8bae\uff08MCP\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0eAVEVA Process Simulation (APS)\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Python\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u9879\u6c34-\u7532\u9187\u5206\u79bb\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u9886\u57df\u5747\u5177\u5907\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u4ecd\u6709\u6280\u672f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u529f\u80fd\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u671b\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4eff\u771f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\\mathfrak{Q}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\\mathcal{W}_{\\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Integrating MWIR and LWIR within a single device is challenging due to distinct materials, cooling needs, and detection mechanisms, while such integration is critical for improved object recognition, temperature estimation, and environmental sensing. In this work, we demonstrate a Spintronic Poisson (SP) bolometer enabling room-temperature ultra-broadband sensing across 3-14 um. Unlike conventional bolometers that rely on continuous analog signals, the SP bolometer implements a Poisson-counting detection paradigm, encoding temperature in discrete stochastic events, which turns thermal noise from a limitation into the basis of the estimator itself.

But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $\u03bc$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $\u03bc$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible.", "AI": {"tldr": "Berry curvature's effects are seen in fermions with closed momentum paths, such as around impurities, leading to persistent phase coherence over macroscopic lengths in a quasi-2D metal with chiral boundaries and a magnetic field inducing loop-current order with long coherence lengths despite short mean-free paths.", "motivation": "The paper explores the role of Berry curvature in maintaining phase coherence in metals, particularly in topological or quasi-topological states, and relates this to experimental observations of flux quantization and loop-current order.", "method": "The authors employ theoretical analysis, likely involving tight-binding models or quantum transport theory, focusing on Berry curvature in momentum space and its effects on boundary currents and phase coherence.

The objective is to optimize the combined requirements of high radiation length and stiffness properties of the designed materials. The present study targets conventional beampipe materials such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel as primary performance benchmarks. These conventional beampipes are used at synchrotron radiation sources, such as Indus-1 and Indus-2 in India, the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility in Russia, and the ring synchrotron facility SIS 100/300 at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Germany. In this context, a series of ternary Mg--Al--Li alloys is systematically investigated to enhance the figure of merit. Two aluminum--rich alloys, A1 ($\\mathrm{Al_{61.5}Li_{10.8}Mg_{27.7}}$) and A2 ($\\mathrm{Al_{66}Li_{19.4}Mg_{14.6}}$), along with three magnesium-rich alloys, M1 ($\\mathrm{Al_{23.9}Li_{29.3}Mg_{46.8}}$), M2 ($\\mathrm{Al_{19}Li_{20.6}Mg_{60.4}}$), and M3 ($\\mathrm{Al_{39.8}Li_{20.1}Mg_{40.1}}$) are explored. Thermodynamic stability, density, liquidus temperature, and phases are evaluated using Latin hypercube sampling within the Thermo-Calc TC-Python framework. Elastic properties are obtained from density functional theory calculations performed using the Vienna \\textit{Ab Initio} Simulation Package.

Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $\u03c3_\\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques. Effective energy gaps can be deduced from the temperature dependence of $\u03c3_\\mathrm{xx}$, which are drastically different from those provided by conventional transport data.

We find that the survival probability exhibits a two-stage decay pattern: an initial exponential regime followed by a long-time power-law tail, a signature of the stickiness effect. Our results show that the short-time exponential decay rate follows a power-law dependence on the hole size, with different scaling exponents for holes placed in chaotic regions versus mixed phase space regions. For holes located in mixed phase space regions, the decay exponent of the long-time power-law tail remains approximately constant, while the amplitude follows a power-law scaling with hole size.

The physical origin of this torsion remains debated and is often attributed to helically arranged load-bearing elements, despite the lack of direct evidence for helicity in the native fiber. Here we show that torsion can arise generically from nonlinear anisotropic elasticity: humidity-driven shortening of the amorphous matrix, mechanically constrained by stiff, axially aligned $\u03b2$-sheet--rich load-bearing segments and their experimentally induced prestretch, drives the system into a dual Poynting regime in which axial shortening couples to spontaneous twist. Coupling a diffusion-based water-uptake law to irreversible matrix remodeling and fiber plasticity, the model quantitatively reproduces monotonic and cyclic torsional measurements using parameter values consistent with available experimental material parameters. These results identify supercontraction-induced torsion in spider silk as a manifestation of a dual Poynting effect and provide a minimal, physically grounded framework for humidity-driven torsional actuation in matrix--fiber architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the mechanism behind the torsional actuation in spider silk supercontracts caused by humidity changes, specifically the superconducting silk (spider dragline silk) under varying humidity conditions.

In this paper, we perform bihamiltonian tests for these DR hierarchies, and conjecture that the ones that are bihamiltonian form a $2$-parameter family. Remarkably, our computations suggest that there is a $1$-parameter subfamily of the rank-$1$ F-CohFTs, where the corresponding DR hierarchy is conjecturally Miura equivalent to the Camassa--Holm hierarchy. We also prove a conjecture regarding bihamiltonian Hodge hierarchies. Finally, we systematically study Miura invariants, and for another $1$-parameter subfamily propose a conjectural relation to the Degasperis--Procesi hierarchy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u53cc_ramification (DR) \u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u6709\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u6c34\u5cad (GCS) \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u6270\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b DR \u6307\u6570\u662f\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 DR \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e Camassa-Holm \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u662f Miura \u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u79ef\u5206 Hodge \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u65cf\u7684 Miura \u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u5176\u4e0e Degasperis-Procesi \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc_ramification (DR) \u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u6709\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u6c34\u5cad (GCS) \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b DR \u6307\u6570\u662f\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9 DR \u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u6709\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u6c34\u5cad (GCS) \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5b50\u65cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0e Camassa-Holm \u548c Degasperis-Procesi \u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53cc_ramification (DR) \u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u6709\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u6c34\u5cad (GCS) \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u6270\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b DR \u6307\u6570\u662f\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 DR \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e Camassa-Holm \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u662f Miura \u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u79ef\u5206 Hodge \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u65cf\u7684 Miura \u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u5176\u4e0e Degasperis-Procesi \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc_ramification (DR) \u6307\u6570\u4e0e\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u6709\u5173\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u5206\u6c34\u5cad (GCS) \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b DR \u6307\u6570\u662f\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u53cc Hamiltonian \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u79e9-1 F-CohFTs \u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684 DR \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e Camassa-Holm \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u662f Miura \u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u79ef\u5206 Hodge \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u5b50\u65cf\u7684 Miura \u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u5176\u4e0e Degasperis-Procesi \u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

To explore the quantum phases across the full range of boson-fermion interactions, we construct a versatile variational ansatz that incorporates pair correlations and correctly captures the different polaron limits. Remarkably, we find that self-bound quantum droplets can exist in the strongly interacting regime, preempting the formation of boson-fermion dimers, when the Fermi pressure is balanced by the resonant boson-fermion attraction. This scenario can be achieved in experimentally available Bose-Fermi mixtures for a range of boson-fermion mass ratios in the vicinity of equal masses. We furthermore show that a larger fermion density instead yields phase separation between a Bose-Fermi mixture and excess fermions, as well as behavior reminiscent of a liquid-gas critical point.

As NV-based optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) systems transition from controlled laboratory environments toward portable and field-deployable sensors, a detailed understanding of realistic noise sources and experimental imperfections becomes essential for optimizing performance and sensitivity. In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation framework, i.e., a digital twin, for continuous-wave wide-field ODMR in NV-center ensembles. The model is built upon a physically consistent seven-level description of the NV center and incorporates a broad range of experimentally relevant noise and imperfection mechanisms as modular, parameterized components.

Three dominant outcomes are identified: a minor three-body channel and two four-body channels (sequential and near-simultaneous dissociation of both molecules). The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER. Overall, early-time charge evolution provides a unifying explanation for channel branching and for the channel-resolved fragmentation signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term \u03b3 on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in \u03b3 compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent \u03bd regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects.

Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $\u03bd= 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons.

Within this framework, the integrability conditions which were originally put forward by Gaudin have been further generalized. In this work, building on Gaudin's generalized kaleidoscope model, we present a detailed investigation of the relationship between DN symmetry and its integrability. We demonstrate that the mathematical essence of integrability in this class of models is characterized by a newly proposed Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation. Furthermore, we show that the solvability of a model via the coordinate Bethe ansatz depends not only on the consistency relations satisfied by scattering matrices, but also on the model's boundary conditions and the symmetry of the subspace where solutions are sought. Through finite element method based numerical studies, we further confirm that Bethe ansatz integrability arises in a specific symmetry sector. Finally, by analyzing the algebraic structure of the Kaleidoscope Yang-Baxter Equation, we derive a series of novel quantum algebraic identities within the framework of quantum torus algebra.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We show that there are two sets of special transitions between two different hyperfine ground states ($|F$=9/2, $m_{F}$=1/2$\\rangle$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, -1/2$\\rangle$ and $|$9/2, -1/2$\\rangle$ $\\Leftrightarrow$ $|$7/2, 1/2$\\rangle$), whose microwave single-photon transition frequency is insensitive to low magnetic fields, as the first-order Zeeman shift is almost completely canceled.

By systematically varying the qubit frequency detuning, we measure cross-Kerr inter-qubit interaction strengths ranging from 10 MHz up to 350 MHz, more than an order of magnitude larger than previously observed in similar capacitively coupled systems. In this configuration, the qubits enter a strong-interaction regime in which the excitation of one qubit inhibits that of its neighbor, demonstrating a dynamical blockade mediated entirely by the engineered ZZ coupling. Circuit quantization simulations accurately reproduce the experimental results, while perturbative models confirm the theoretical origin of the energy shift as a hybridization between the computational states and higher-excitation manifolds. We establish a robust and scalable method to access interaction-dominated physics in superconducting circuits, providing a pathway towards solid-state implementations of globally controlled quantum architectures and cooperative many-body dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027transmon qubits\u4e4b\u95f4\u7eaf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7535\u5bb9\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7eb5\u5411(ZZ)\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6e10\u53d8\u5316\u7684qubit\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u4ece10 MHz\u5230350 MHz\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9Kerr\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684ately\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u9ad8\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2aqubits\u8fdb\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u533a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2aqubit\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u5176\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7531\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u963b\u585e\u3002\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b8c\u5168\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u5fae\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u8ba4\u80fd\u91cf\u4f4d\u79fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8d77\u6e90\u662f\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6001\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684\u65e0\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6742\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u4ef7\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u56fa\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u98de\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027qubits\u56e0\u5176\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u6d41\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24qubit\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684 Many-Body \u52a8\u6001\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63a7\u5236\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u7535\u5bb9\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027transmon qubits\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u7eb5\u5411(ZZ)\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574qubit\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9Kerr\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u7535\u8def\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027transmon qubits\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7eb5\u5411(ZZ)\u8026\u5408\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8qubit\u9891\u7387\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9Kerr\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u4e3a10 MHz\u81f3350 MHz\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b\u5728\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0cqubits\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7eaf\u7535\u5bb9\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027qubits\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684 Many-Body \u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5904\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Current systems use bulky, power-hungry modulators and frequency shifters which are difficult to integrate and limit portability and scalability. We report an electrically controllable, agile optical frequency source based on a semiconductor laser stabilized to a photonic-integrated, lead zirconate titanate (PZT)-actuated resonator cavity. We demonstrate this approach with precision programmable frequency control of a 780-nm laser that can periodically reference to rubidium spectroscopy followed by fast, programmable, arbitrary frequency tuning sequences for quantum control. We use this approach to demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of rubidium-87 without any external modulators, achieving atom-cloud temperatures as low as 16 $\u03bc$K. The device achieves a tuning strength up to 1 GHz/V with 11 MHz modulation bandwidth while consuming only 10 nW of electrical power.

For the case $\u03c9< -3/2$, where energy conditions are violated and bouncing solutions exist classically, we demonstrate that quantum backreaction effects significantly smooth the bounce of directional scale factors, with the bounce occurring at scales set by the quantum state width. For the conformally invariant case $\u03c9= -3/2$, quantum corrections cause scale factors to enter accelerated expansion phases more rapidly than in the classical limit. Most significantly, we show that cross-correlation terms between canonical variables are essential for obtaining physically consistent effective dynamics: neglecting these terms leads to spurious divergences and unphysical behavior. When correlations are included, small-amplitude oscillations appear shortly after the bounce, rapidly damping to classical trajectories.

Here, we investigate guided surface acoustic wave phononic four-wave mixing at gigahertz frequencies in an aluminum scandium nitride/4H-silicon carbide heterostructure operated at both room temperature (295 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K). The 500 nm thick aluminum scandium nitride film supports guided Rayleigh and Sezawa modes with distinct displacement and strain energy density distributions, allowing a direct comparison of mode-dependent nonlinear behavior within the same device. Continuous-wave four-wave mixing measurements reveal an enhancement in the extracted modal nonlinear coefficient at 4 K relative to 295 K for both modes. In addition, the Rayleigh mode exhibits a modal nonlinearity approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Sezawa mode across both temperature regimes.

For the BERT-based models, the adjustment reduces the discrepancy in the total neutron yield from about 20% to approximately 6%, while for the BIC-based models it improves the agreement from roughly 13% to the sub-percent level (~0.3%), indicating a markedly better consistency of the BIC-based models with the experimental data.

The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative \"minimal model\" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of \"bright\" and \"dark\" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While high-purity electronic-grade diamond exhibits third-order nonlinear absorption, NV-doped samples display pronounced saturable absorption that strengthens with increasing defect concentration. Linear transmission spectroscopy reveals that, in addition to NV centers, the crystals host significant populations of H2 (NVN-) defect complexes whose absorption band partially overlaps the excitation wavelength. By correlating spectroscopic data with nonlinear measurements and modeling the response using an effective two-level system, we show that the observed saturation cannot be attributed solely to NV centers but arises from the combined contribution of NV-related and H2 defects. For the highly doped sample, we determine an effective linear absorption coefficient of alpha0 = 6.52 cm-1 and a saturation intensity of Is = 40.0 GW/cm2.

By exploiting the hotspot formation in the vicinity of plasmonic structures, SERS constitutes an established tool for fundamental biological research, particularly for early-stage disease diagnostics. In this context, the DNA Origami technique, with its high addressability, enables both the assembly of plasmonic nanostructures with nanometric accuracy, and the deterministic placement of a single analyte molecule precisely at the generated hotspot within them. To date, most DNA Origami based nanoantennas rely on gold or silver nanoparticles (NPs), whose plasmonic resonances are confined to the visible spectrum, severely limiting their use in other spectral ranges. To extend the operating range, we have recently established a robust strategy for self-assembling programmable ultraviolet (UV)-plasmonic dimer antennas using rhodium nanocubes. Herein, we leverage this tailored architecture to systematically investigate its performance for single-molecule UV-SERS. We demonstrated how biofabricated Rh-dimers can be used to detect the characteristic SERS signal of a single streptavidin molecule linked at the dimer s gap. Our results are validated through polarization dependent measurements that yield the expected signal modulation depending on the the dimer orientation only for the DNA origami with a protein at the hotspot.

While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots.

However, this paradigm may break down in complex systems, where quantum interference and memory effects render the particle propagation anomalous, often fostering localization. Here we report on the observation of such anomalous dynamics in a minimal setting: an ultracold mass-imbalanced mixture of two fermionic gases in three dimensions. We release light impurities into a gas of heavier atoms and follow their evolution across different collisional regimes. Under strong interspecies interactions, by lowering the temperature we unveil a crossover from normal diffusion to subdiffusion. Simultaneously, a localized fraction of the light gas emerges, displaying no discernible dynamics over hundreds of collisions. Our findings, incompatible with the conventional Fermi-liquid picture, are instead captured by a model of an atom propagating through a (quasi-)static disordered landscape of point-like scatterers. These results highlight the key role of quantum interference in our mixture, which emerges as a versatile platform for exploring disorder-free localization phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u7ec4\u5206\u8d85\u51b7\u8d39\u7c73\u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u73bb\u7483\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6781\u7aef\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u73bb\u7483\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u73bb\u7483\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u51b7\u7684\u4e24\u6210\u5206\u8d39\u7c73\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u7ec4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u73bb\u7483\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u5f97\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u4e0e\u76f4\u89d2\u5750\u6807\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u6620\u5c04\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u4e0e\u76f4\u89d2\u5750\u6807\u6709\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d77\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

In this paper we prove that any Hamiltonian hosting such ``ferromagnetic scar states'' necessarily admits a structural decomposition into a Zeeman term and an ``annihilator'' that annihilates the entire scar manifold. Moreover, we show that this annihilator must itself decompose into a sum of terms built from local projectors that locally annihilate the scar states.

In this approach, neither inertia nor free fall is assumed a priori. Instead, the motion of any local system arises from its dynamical interdependence, direct or indirect, with the rest of the Universe. This viewpoint provides a sharp criterion for what qualifies as a genuinely Machian gravitational theory.

The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate. Along the direct pathway, CO$_2$ is preferentially vibrationally excited with H$_2$in its vibrational ground state, whereas for the indirect pathway going through formic acid, H$_2$ can populate levels with $v > 0$. For all product channels passing through energized formic acid, the lifetime distributions are described by stretched exponentials with $\u03b2$ ranging from 1.1 to 1.7.

To improve the efficiency of a packed-bed SHS system through second law analysis (SLA), we developed macroscopic entropy and exergy transport equations for fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media based on microscopic transport equations. These equations enable us to identify where and how much exergy is destroyed. Using a packed-bed SHS system developed at the PROMES-CNRS laboratory as a test case, we demonstrated how to apply SLA to optimize an SHS system. Our analysis revealed that, in addition to exit and heat leakage losses at tank surfaces, thermal and solid conduction losses inside the tank significantly contribute to total loss in the studied SHS system. These internal losses occur close to the thermocline. However, their slower transport causes a delay in their emergence. The SLA suggests an optimal tank aspect ratio of D/H = 0.75, at which the total exergy loss coefficient reaches its minimum value when exit loss is not considered. As particle size decreases, the exergy loss coefficient also decreases due to enhanced heat transfer between the fluid and solid phases. The pressure loss for the studied SHS system is negligible. The SLA favors a truncated cone-shaped tank with a slightly larger upper surface. Through the SLA, the exergy loss coefficient is reduced from 4.9% for the original design to 4.1% for the optimized design.

In this theoretical work, we explore how tunneling dynamics in a bosonic Josephson junction are modified when the system is placed in a rotating, non-inertial frame. We show that the tunneling dynamics of ultracold bosons in a two-dimensional double-well potential offer an alternative pathway for inferring the rotation frequency. Using the mean-field and many-body analyses, we demonstrate that rotation strongly modifies the tunneling time period as well as the momentum and angular momentum dynamics. When the rotation axis passes through the center of the double well, the observables show distinct dynamical responses with increasing rotation frequency, enabling the rotation frequency to be assessed from changes in the tunneling dynamics. When the potential is displaced from the rotation axis, the rotation induces asymmetric tunneling and partial self-trapping, allowing both the rotation frequency and the displacement to be inferred. We further show that for an off-centered double well, the tunneling dynamics exhibit a pronounced orientation dependence, enabling the orientation of the double well to be inferred from the observed dynamics. The many-body analysis further shows that the depletion dynamics are strongly influenced by rotation, providing an additional tool for assessing the rotation frequency. Finally, we study the effect of time-dependent rotation in which the double well is gradually set into motion in the laboratory frame and identify distinct dynamical signatures that depend sensitively on the switching time.

This paper aims to overcome that limitation by introducing a novel approach to enhance TERS performance with lower NA.", "method": "The researchers developed a PTTP design involving a plasmonic bi-cavity tip. They co-tuned the tip's geometry by adjusting the nanopyramid length (L) and plateau length (W). Finite-element simulations were employed to identify critical parameters, specifically W, which influences surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) resonance. Through co-tuning of L and W, they achieved a periodic series of maximal apex |E|^2. Experimental results on monolayer graphene demonstrated the near-field enhancement and the characteristic annular PSF with NA = 0.75.", "result": "The study successfully demonstrated that PTTP enhances TERS performance under radially polarized, on-axis excitation with a low-NA objective. The experimental results matched the theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of the PTTP design. This advancement shows promise for practical, deployment-ready Raman instruments that can operate in environments with limited working distances.", "conclusion": "This work opens new possibilities for Raman spectroscopy by reducing the required NA, thus expanding its application in various fields."}}

As established in recent work, the application of such approaches is not limited by the nonlocal structure of JW strings or by site ordering, because string operators can be absorbed into Thouless rotations of a Slater determinant, and the variational optimization of a unitary Lie-Algebraic similarity transformation removes any ordering dependence. Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters.

The proposed system is based on a proximity-focusing RICH configuration including an aerogel radiator separated from a SiPM array layer by an expansion gap. A thin high-refractive index window of transparent material, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is glued on the SiPM array to enable time-of-flight measurements of charged particles by exploiting the yield of Cherenkov photons in the thin window.

Radar suits this role by sensing motion through occlusions and in darkness. Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) significantly outperform traditional CNNs in radar-based occupancy classification, achieving superior accuracy while drastically reducing parameters.", "motivation": "To enhance privacy-preserving monitoring in challenging environments like elder care using radar sensing, which is effective under low SNR and without cameras or wearables.", "method": "Benchmarked a 2-qubit HQNN against CNNs using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar data, with both clean conditions and noisy evaluations.", "result": "In clean conditions, HQNN achieves 99.7% (synthetic) and 97.0% (real) accuracy with 170x fewer parameters.

Here, extending superradiant effects to photon pair generation from multi-level atoms, two-photon process offers a pathway to novel quantum light sources and a useful case for practical superradiance. We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics. Furthermore, our heralded single-photon superradiance is accompanied by a coincidence-to-accidental ratio of 200 and the detected photon-pair counting exceeding 10^6 pairs/s.

Here we present DeepHostGuest, a geometric deep-learning framework that learns generalizable recognition principles directly from experimentally resolved host-guest structures. Hosts are encoded as electrostatic surfaces and guests as molecular graphs, enabling transferable learning across diverse supramolecular systems. DeepHostGuest achieves high-accuracy predictions (RMSD $\\leq 2$ Angstrom for 80.8% of test cases), substantially outperforming classical docking without case-specific tuning. Notably, the method generalizes beyond its training domain to crystalline sponge systems, accurately capturing the binding of large amphiphilic molecules within metal-organic cages. Beyond predicting binding conformations, the structures generated by DeepHostGuest serve as a reliable basis for accurate binding free-energy calculations. Density Functional Theory (DFT)-calculated affinities correlate well with experiment, enabling structure-property relationships across 876 host-guest complexes spanning 34 host families. Interpretable feature analysis reveals that binding strength arises from a cooperative interplay of host polarity, guest hydrophobicity, and geometric complementarity, with distinct design regimes across supramolecular classes.

Despite its prevalence, such coupling is typically ignored in conventional metasurface design frameworks due to the high characterization complexity, leading to suboptimal device performance. Here, we reveal a distinctive long-range coupling that exceeds an order of magnitude compared with the interaction range of evanescent waves, substantially enriching the metasurface design landscapes. This coupling exhibits pronounced graph topological features, and we design a graph neural network (GNN) to accurately abstract its inherent physics. Through strategic enhancement of the coupling effects, the discrete metasurface responses are transformed into continuous states, thereby unlocking diverse multiplexing channels. By further integrating the GNN into an inverse design agent, we tailor the multi-channel global response of metasurface to support simultaneous multiplexing across angle, frequency, and polarization domains. Experimentally, we demonstrate a compact metasurface multiplexer with eight independent channels, showcasing its potential for next-generation vehicular networks.

Linear $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems made of two coupled resonators have exceptional point of degeneracy (EPD), around which square-root sensitivity is observed. However, realistic systems with gain are inherently saturable and nonlinear, thereby invalidating linear assumptions, and when $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is broken the coupled resonator system becomes unstable, hence it seems that the best working regime is to use such instability to make an SS-EPD-based oscillator. We study the saturated steady-state of a general system of two coupled oscillators with saturable nonlinear gain. Extending previous analyses, we find the steady-state oscillation frequency-gain pairs, and we analytically and numerically derive the sensitivity of the oscillation frequency to system's perturbations around a unique third-order degeneracy which corresponds to SS$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry because it is the saturated gain that is symmetric to losses.

A key subsystem for charged particle identification will be a Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector consisting of an aerogel radiator and a photosensitive surface based on Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays in a proximity-focusing configuration. A thin high-refractive index slab of transparent material (window), acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is glued on the entrance face of the SiPM arrays to achieve precise charged particle timing. Requiring time matching between aerogel Cherenkov photon and track hits leads to an improvement of pattern recognition by discarding the uncorrelated SiPM dark count hits. In this work we present the current status of the R\\&D performed for the ALICE 3 RICH detector prototype and the expected full scale system performance. A special focus will be given to the beam test results obtained with a small-scale prototype instrumented with various array of Hamamatsu SiPMs with pitches ranging from 1 to 3 mm. The Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm wavelength. For timing measurements SiPM arrays coupled with two different window materials (SiO$_2$ and MgF$_2$) were used. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line. The data were collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on the Petiroc 2A and Radioroc 2 together with a picoTDC to measure charges and times. We measured a charged particle detection efficiency above 99\\% and a single photon angular resolution better than 4.2 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation with a time resolution better than 70 ps for charged particles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Experimental results demonstrate that increasing circuit depth significantly improves performance, yielding the highest accuracy of 56.2% (Configuration B), compared to a baseline of 51.9%.

This Chapter aims to articulate a foundational thermodynamic approach to the description, interrogation, and design of modern cryopreservation technologies, and to review the state of the art in emerging cryopreservation technologies through the lens of this approach. We focus in particular on the management of phase change across equilibrium-driven techniques (e.g., liquidus tracking, partial freezing, isochoric freezing), kinetics-driven techniques (e.g. supercooling, ice seeding), and transport-driven techniques (e.g. directional freezing, droplet approaches), and we hope to equip the reader with a self-consistent theoretical toolkit that enables meaningful comparison of these techniques from a thermodynamic perspective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u51b7\u51bb\u4fdd\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684 thermodynamic \u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u4ece thermodynamic \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b7\u51bb\u4fdd\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u79d1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece thermodynamic \u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6df1\u5165\u89e3\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 thermodynamic \u539f\u7406\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u51b7\u51bb\u4fdd\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u4f20\u70ed\u9a71\u52a8\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684 thermodynamic \u5de5\u5177\u96c6\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u51b7\u51bb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5171\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u72ec\u7279\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bfb\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u51b7\u51bb\u4fdd\u5b58\u6280\u672f\u7684 thermodynamic \u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\u03bb$ in the atomic ($t\\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction.

With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects.

In this context, a key subsystem for high-energy charged particle identification will be a proximity-focusing ring-imaging Cherenkov detector using aerogel as radiator and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) as photon sensors. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with Hamamatsu S13352 and S13361-3075AE-08 SiPM arrays, readout by custom boards equipped with front-end Petiroc 2A ASICs. The Cherenkov radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick hydrophobic aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 separated from the SiPM plane by a 23 cm expansion gap. The prototype was successfully tested in a campaign at the CERN PS T10 beam line with the goal of validating the design bRICH specifications in terms to achieve the target separation power. We measured a single photon angular resolution of 3.8~mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value of 242~mrad, as well as the expected scaling of the angular resolution with the increasing number of detected photons. We also studied the contribution of uncorrelated and correlated background sources with respect to the signal and proved the effectiveness of time matching between charged tracks and photon hits to achieve efficient suppression of the SiPM dark count rate background. In this paper, the detector concept, the description of the tested prototype layout and the main beam test results are reported.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The source is implemented in a small, modular architecture featuring a single fiber-coupled input, an electro-optic phase modulator combined with a single Fabry-Perot etalon for probe generation, and two free-space output modes corresponding to the signal and conjugate fields. Optimized for low pump power, the system achieves up to -8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing at an analysis frequency of 0.8 MHz with a pump power of only 300 mW.

The linear perturbation analysis is performed in the background \u00c6ther-orthogonal frame, in which the axes of the gravitational wave sound cones remain perpendicular to these hypersurfaces, thereby simplifying the analysis. The leading-order results show that Einstein-\u00c6ther theory admits two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode, consistent with the findings in the flat spacetime background. We further derive the dispersion relations and linear stability conditions for these modes in curved backgrounds. At next-to-leading order, we obtain the amplitude evolution equations, finding that the graviton number is conserved for the tensor modes but not for the vector and scalar modes. Next-to-leading-order effects also induce mixing among polarization modes. Our study demonstrates that, after imposing the GW170817 constraint on the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the vector modes mixed with the leading-order tensor modes cannot be used to distinguish between general relativity and Einstein-\u00c6ther theory.

Enumerated chemical spaces aim to reduce this bottleneck by predefining synthesizable regions of chemical space from available building blocks and reliable reactions, yet existing commercial spaces are still limited by long turnaround times, narrow reaction scope, and substantial manual decision-making in route selection and execution.\n  Here we present the first version of onepot CORE, an enumerated chemical space containing 3.4B molecules and corresponding on-demand synthesis product enabled by an automated synthesis platform and an AI chemist, Phil, that designs, executes, and analyzes experiments. onepot CORE is constructed by (i) selecting a reaction set commonly used in medicinal chemistry, (ii) sourcing and curating building blocks from supplier catalogs, (iii) enumerating candidate products, and (iv) applying ML-based feasibility assessment to prioritize compounds for robust execution.

We find that the tunnelling probability is increasingly suppressed as the strength of the non-linearity is enhanced. We further find that smaller black holes exhibit a significantly higher tunnelling probability compared to larger ones, indicating a departure from classical behaviour.

However, the temporal stability remains challenged by issues like line-width broadening and high-power demand in efforts to improve it. In this work, we investigate the effect of the second-harmonic generation process on the laser characteristics under three longitudinal mode regimes: single-longitudinal-mode, dual-longitudinal-mode, and multi-longitudinal-mode. The results demonstrate that the second-harmonic generation process effectively stabilizes the temporal characteristics of the laser and enhances its correlation, leading to a temporally clean output beam. The physical mechanism of the observed temporal stabilization effect can be attributed to a high-peak-pulse attenuation effect, jointly induced by nonuniform longitudinal-mode depletion and phase preservation in the residual fundamental wave. Statistical analysis indicates that at the maximum fundamental-wave power in the multi-longitudinal-mode regime, the standard deviation and peak-to-valley values derived from the normalized temporal profile decrease from 0.6122 and 5.6846 for the fundamental wave to 0.189 and 0.8847 for the residual fundamental wave. Meanwhile, the background level of the intensity auto-correlation function rises from ~0.72 to ~0.96, revealing its evolution toward a more coherent state. To the best of our knowledge, this research presents the first demonstration of laser temporal stabilization and correlation enhancement via second-harmonic generation. It not only deepens the comprehension of second-harmonic generation mechanisms, but also opens up a new avenue for realizing temporal beam self-cleaning of light.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We demonstrate that the transition-metal substitution activates otherwise symmetry-forbidden magnon modes through mirror-symmetry breaking of the underlying spin-orbital configuration. This effect can be theoretically explained by the local structural distortions induced in the RuO$_6$ octahedra near the dopant, that enable the observation of mixed-parity one-magnon modes.

Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation.

Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5.

We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels.

In this work, we systematically explore whether a Peres-type criterion can be established for EPR steering in the two-qubit system. Focusing on rank-2 (including rank-1) states and the two-qubit Werner state, we analyze the eigenvalues of their partially transposed density matrices and construct a significant steering criterion based on symmetric combinations of these eigenvalues.

Because the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are highly sensitive to their size and shape, nanoscale visualization of nanoparticle growth is crucial for detailed understanding of growth mechanisms and precise control of particle geometry. However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level.

Central to their performance is the encoding strategy to unknown spectra, which determines the efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability of spectral reconstruction. However, the absence of a unified spectral encoding framework has hindered the realization of optimal, high-performance compact spectrometers. We propose a transformative approach: an information-theoretic framework grounded in bio-inspired Bayesian expected information gain that defines the first generic light encoder for computational spectrometers. By optimizing three fundamental attributes at the lowest level of physical hierarchy, (1) orthogonality, (2) completeness, and (3) sparsity, we establish a design paradigm that transcends conventional encoding hardware limitations. We validate this paradigm with the first generic encoder capable of dynamically reconfiguring its response matrices. Experiments show superior reconstruction fidelity across diverse spectral regimes, enabling tunable spectral encoding tailored to varied input features. An ultra-high resolution of 6 pm and a broad measurable bandwidth of 30 nm are experimentally validated.

In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit.

In this theory, the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated with metric perturbations of polar and axial parities (\"isospectrality\") of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity no longer holds. How does this loss of isospectrality translate into the time-domain ringdown of gravitational waves? Given such a ringdown, can we identify the two \"fundamental quasinormal modes\" associated to the two metric-perturbation parities? We study these questions through a large suite of time-domain numerical simulations, by a prescription on how to relate the gauge-invariant master functions that describe metric perturbations of each parity with the gravitational polarizations. Under the assumptions made in our calculations, we find that it is in general difficult to identify either of the two fundamental modes from the time series, although finding evidence for a non-general-relativistic mode is possible sometimes.

In this work, we investigate multiparameter quantum estimation in baryon-antibaryon (B bar-B) pairs produced via the e+ e- -> J/psi -> B bar-B process at the BESIII experiment, utilizing the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) formalism. Moreover, the QFIM defines the quantum Cramer-Rao bound and dictates the choice of optimal probe states. We compare individual and simultaneous estimation strategies for two key physical parameters: the scattering angle phi and the decay parameter alpha_psi. The estimation variances are found to depend strongly on the explored region of the (phi, alpha_psi) parameter space and to display markedly different temporal dynamics. In general, higher true values of a parameter increase the system's sensitivity, thereby significantly reducing the associated variance. While both variances increase with evolution time, they do so at distinct rates, revealing parameter-dependent information loss driven by environmental decoherence.

The regularized metric replaces $r^2$ by $r^2+\u03c3^2$ in the angular part, where $\u03c3$ is the resolution scale from the width of the Gaussian probe. The resulting Gaussian curvature integrates to $-2\u03c0$, independently of $\u03c3$, and including the boundary contribution, yields Euler characteristic $\u03c7=0$, corresponding to a punctured plane. This curvature defines an effective stress-energy source with total energy $E_{\\text{eff}}=-1/(4G)$, universal and $\u03c3$-independent. Spatial slices embed isometrically as helicoids, and geodesics exhibit a characteristic swirling motion. These results show that finite spatial resolution measurement does not merely smooth singularities but imprints topological defects with fixed physical consequences, suggesting that observational limitations fundamentally shape spacetime geometry.

As a step in this direction, we present a systematic and numerically exact quantum dynamical study of cooperative reaction dynamics inside an optical microcavity. Using a hierarchy of model systems with increasing complexity, we elucidate how cavity-modified reactivity emerges from-and is highly sensitive to-subtle structural and environmental variations. Our models consist of optically dark reactive molecules, each represented by a symmetric double well potential, coupled to infrared-active non-reactive intramolecular or solvent vibrational modes, as well as their respective dissipative environments. Our results demonstrate that cavity-induced rate modifications arise from a delicate interplay among mode hybridization in strong-coupling regimes, the dynamical balance of all participating energy exchange processes, and quantum interference between multiple fluctuation-dissipation-mediated reaction pathways enabled by collective cavity coupling. By continuously tuning a single system parameter or introducing molecular collectivity, we observe qualitatively distinct rate modification profiles as functions of the cavity frequency, including resonant rate enhancement, resonant rate suppression, hybridization-induced peak splitting, and, notably, asymmetric Fano-type line shapes in which enhancement peaks and suppression dips coexist within a narrow resonance window, highlighting the important role of quantum interference in cavity-modified chemical reactivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u5fae\u8154\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5206\u5b50\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6291\u5236\u3001\u5206\u5cf0\u548c\u4ea4\u9519\u5cf0\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5149\u573a\u5bf9\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5149\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5316\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u5b50\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5149\u5fae\u8154\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u5fae\u8154\u73af\u5883\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u53cd\u5e94\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6291\u5236\u3001\u5206\u5cf0\u548c\u4ea4\u9519\u5cf0\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u5728 Collective\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u573a\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u63a7\u5206\u5b50\u53cd\u5e94\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields.

The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This method eliminates deposition-etch cycles and reduces each layer to only two fabrication steps, enabling efficient realization of multilayer architectures. Using this platform, we demonstrate multilayer q-BIC-derived metasurfaces with independently tunable resonance wavelengths and linewidths, allowing the construction of compact multi-resonant filters with spectrally decoupled layers. We experimentally demonstrate three-layer devices supporting three resonances and show independent control of resonance wavelength and Q factor across layers. Leveraging this capability, we generate decorrelated filter arrays for compressive sensing and hyperspectral reconstruction, achieving sets of 9 and 36 filters with average absolute Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.11 and 0.21, surpassing prior metasurface and photonic-crystal implementations.

Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models.

We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function.

The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG.", "AI": {"tldr": "The key finding is that in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), a magnetic field can induce correlated Chern insulator (CCI) states through a mechanism involving spin and valley Zeeman effects, which are critical in shaping the material's Hofstadter spectrum.

In quantum measurement, amplifier operation is conventionally optimized in the linear regime by maximizing signal-to-noise ratio, an objective that is well-suited to parameter estimation but is typically insufficient for more general tasks such as arbitrary quantum state discrimination. Here we show that single-shot quantum state classification can benefit from operating a quantum amplifier outside the linear regime, when the measurement chain is optimized end-to-end for a task-specific cost function. We analyze a realistic superconducting readout architecture that includes state preparation, cryogenic nonlinear amplification, and room-temperature detection with finite noise. By introducing performance metrics tailored to state discrimination, we identify operating regimes in which nonlinear amplification provides a measurable advantage and clarify the trade-offs that ultimately limit classification fidelity.

Gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence of a previously unknown black hole mass range, which provides new information to update the entropy budget. Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an ``entropy floor\" in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Black holes contain more entropy than the universe, and gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo help update the entropy budget.

The study reveals that mergers play a dominant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe, especially if primordial black holes constitute a non-zero fraction of dark matter. Additionally, it is found that gravitational wave energy is less efficiently generated compared to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of black holes. These findings enhance our understanding of the thermodynamic processes occurring in the early universe and the role of black holes in entropy generation.", "conclusion": "This research highlights the critical role of black hole mergers in the early universe's entropy budget, providing new constraints on the abundance and role of primordial black holes in dark matter. The findings also emphasize the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where gravitational wave energy generation is less efficient compared to entropy production via the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.

Lacking a full non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity, we adopt a metric-based approach. We construct a stationary, axisymmetric ansatz via the Newman-Janis algorithm to model the kinematic features of a rotating black hole subject to Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP) corrections. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that in the infrared-dominated regime, the Hawking temperature scales as $T_H \\sim M^{-3}$, leading to a rapid cooling phase that significantly prolongs the lifetime of supermassive black holes. We derive the modified Teukolsky Master Equation for gravitational perturbations and demonstrate that the background geometry preserves the isospectrality between axial and polar modes.

Their development has had a transformative impact on optics and physics, and they remain the central platform for both fundamental discoveries and practical photonic technologies. However, the relatively large footprint and substrate-bound nature of photonic crystal structures have so far strongly limited their use as miniature optical devices or biointegrated sensors. Here, we overcome these limitations by identifying the minimal size of a 2D photonic crystal array needed to achieve lasing and describe the fabrication of substrate-less hexagonal laser particles with an active area as small as 30 \u03bcm2. Massively parallel fabrication, robust detachment, and integration of the nanolaser particles into live cells is demonstrated. Crucially, by engineering spatial and spectral mode characteristics, we designed NIR-II probes with mode volumes on the order of tens of attolitres, an order of magnitude smaller than whispering gallery probes of similar dimensions. Such high light localization is comparable in scale to different organelles of eucaryotic cells.

A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moir\u00e9 Hamiltonians, we find that the first moir\u00e9 valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moir\u00e9 band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $\u03bd_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $\u03b8= 2.45^\\circ$ and $2.13^\\circ$. At $\u03b8= 2.45^\\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $\u03bd_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL. In contrast, at $\u03b8= 2.13^\\circ$, a charge-density-wave state prevails in the competition with the MR state due to the larger bandwidth.

From quantum capacitance measurements, we extract power versus frequency spectra and fit Lorentzian line shapes to obtain the linewidth, amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and coherence time. The signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the ratio of the parity measurement signal to background noise and serves as an indicator of readout quality, while the coherence time characterizes the timescale for decoherence of the quantum state.

By leveraging machine-learning techniques and neural density estimators, it enables flexible likelihood or posterior modeling directly from simulations. We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets.

They also offer intrinsic anisotropic optical properties, which can be used to shape and manipulate light even inside spatially highly symmetric structures. Here, we report the synthesis and detailed optical characterization of a spherical bipolar liquid crystal polymer microlaser that tightly confines the optical path of whispering gallery modes to the equatorial plane. By controlled anchoring of the liquid crystal mesogens followed by polymerization, a fixed refractive index gradient is formed within the spherical microcavity. Consequently, only transverse electric (TE) modes oscillating in the equatorial plane experience the high extraordinary refractive index, allowing to confine lasing into a single plane. Furthermore, we observe that the refractive index gradient causes a characteristic splitting of the TE modes. By combining hyperspectral imaging and analytical modeling, we demonstrate that the observed splitting is caused by lifting of the energy degeneracy of higher order azimuthal laser modes, enabling direct insights into the complex interplay of refractive index gradients and resulting whispering gallery mode confinement. In addition, the unique ability to confine lasing of a spherical microbead into only a single plane makes these microlasers independent of the exact position of the pump beam, which allows consistent localized sensing especially in combination with fast point scanning microscopes or inside highly dynamic biological environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Full-wave numerical simulation is highly desired for their design and optimization, but it is notoriously difficult, even for two-dimensional metasurfaces, when they comprise a huge number of subwavelength elements. This paper focuses on two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces that contain only a relatively small number of distinct subwavelength elements. We develop an efficient numerical method based on Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators, the finite element method and local function expansions. Our method drastically reduces the total number of unknowns and is capable of simulating two-dimensional metasurfaces with $10^{5}$ subwavelength elements on a personal computer. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method maintains high accuracy while offering significant advantages in both computational time and memory usage compared to the classical full-domain finite element method, making it particularly suited for the analysis of large metasurfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e8c\u7ef4\u975e\u5468\u671f\u53cc\u5143\u7535\u6781\u5316\u8868\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53cc\u5143\u7535\u6781\u5316\u8868\u9762\u901a\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u68d8\u624b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5168\u57df\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u542b\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u5b50\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNeumann-to-Dirichlet\u7b97\u5b50\u3001\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2a\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u62e5\u670910^5\u4e2a\u5b50\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5143\u4ef6\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53cc\u5143\u7535\u6781\u5316\u8868\u9762\u3002\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5168\u57df\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53cc\u5143\u7535\u6781\u5316\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5168\u57df\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically proceed in the forward direction: a model Hamiltonian is specified, implemented on a programmable quantum platform, and its phase diagram and properties are explored. Here we present a quantum algorithmic framework for inverse quantum simulation, enabling quantum material design with desired properties. Target material characteristics are encoded as a cost function, which is minimized on quantum hardware to prepare a many-body state with the desired properties in quantum memory. Hamiltonian learning is then used to reconstruct a low-energy Hamiltonian for which this state is an approximate ground state, yielding a physically interpretable model that can guide experimental synthesis. As illustrative applications, we outline how the method can be used to search for high-temperature superconductors within the fermionic Hubbard model, enhancing $d$-wave correlations over a broad range of dopings and temperatures, design quantum phases by stabilizing a topological order through continuous Hamiltonian modifications, and optimize dynamical properties relevant for photochemistry and frequency- and momentum-resolved condensed-matter data.

This gap persists even though, for more conventional light-matter interactions, the complex underlying electron dynamics can often be confined to a single Brillouin zone and described well within the dipole approximation. Previous studies were restricted to nonlinear, perturbative regimes, largely because the generation of intense ultrashort vortex pulses, particularly in the mid-infrared spectral regime, has remained a long-standing challenge. Consequently, the role of structured light in driving nonlinear, non-perturbative processes in solids, and the associated transfer of angular momentum during these interactions, has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate solid-state high-harmonic generation (HHG) driven by intense ultrashort structured light using a versatile experimental approach applicable to different materials and geometries. We demonstrate that the OAM of the driving field is coherently transferred to the emitted harmonics. In particular, we show that the OAM is conserved independently of the crystal symmetry, the range of electronic interactions, and the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling. These results establish OAM-resolved HHG as a robust framework for characterizing and controlling angular momentum transfer in solid-state HHG and open new avenues for structured-light-driven quantum technologies and topological materials investigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8c03\u8c10\u5149\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7814\u7a76 solids \u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fa\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u643a\u5e26\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u77ed\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u4e0e\u56fa\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u5e38\u89c4\u5149-\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u5e03\u91cc\u5965\u5c14\u533a\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u591a\u6781\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9650\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u5fae\u6270\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u56f0\u96be\u5728\u4e8e\u5728\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u9891\u6bb5\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u89d2\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f3a\u77ed\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5149\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u672a\u5c55\u5f00\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u5149\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u88ab\u5149\u8c10\u6240\u7ee7\u627f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u8fd8\u662f\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0cOAM \u90fd\u662f\u5b88\u6052\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9a71\u52a8\u5149\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u5149\u8c10\u4e2d\u72ec\u7acb\u4fdd\u5b58\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d7\u6676\u4f53\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u6216\u5f3a\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5149\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5f3a\u77ed\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u5728\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u9ad8\u8c03\u8c10\u5149\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u5149\u8c10\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u56fa\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

As more particles are introduced, they inevitably populate higher energy bands. Whether the inclusion of multiple topological bands leads to new physics remains an open question. Here, we propose a universal picture applicable at higher filling factors $\u03bd\\geq 1$ in bosonic systems: the occupied bands tend to coalesce into an effective single topological band characterized by a total Chern number $\\vert C\\vert$, the sum of the Chern number of all occupied lower topological flat bands. Using a Kekul\u00e9 lattice model with two lower flat bands featuring a total Chern number $C=1$, regardless of their specific configurations, we identify the emergence of a $\\frac{1}{2}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state at integer filling factor $\u03bd=1$, followed by the Jain sequence states $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ at filling $\u03bd=\\frac{4}{3}$ and $\\frac{6}{4}$. That is a $\u03bd+\u03bd$ picture, rather than the generally expected $1+\u03bd^{\\prime}$ picture, where $\u03bd^{\\prime}$ is the permitted FCI filling factor in the single second topological flat band.

In this work, we study the causal structure and emergent \"arrow of time\" in monitored quantum dynamics, particularly their dependence on initial and final states. We propose a new measure, the cross-entropy quantum causal influence, to quantify the extent of causal influence, whose simulation demonstrates exotic causal structures, such as inverted light cones.

We show that non-trivial peculiar velocity fields can be generated through Lorentzian boosts in the non-relativistic limit, where the Eulerian frame is obtained from analytic solutions of Einstein's equations sourced by an irrotational shear-free fluid with nonzero energy flux. This approach provides a physically viable interpretation of these analytic solutions, which (in general) admit no isometries, thus allowing, in principle, for modeling time and space varying 3-dimensional fields of peculiar velocities that can be contrasted with observational data on our local cosmography. As a ``proof of concept'' we examine the peculiar velocities of varying dark matter and dark energy perfect fluids with respect to the CMB frame using a simple, spherically symmetric particular solution. The resulting peculiar velocities are qualitatively compatible with observational data on the CMB dipole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u725b\u987f\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u4f59\u5207\u5750\u6807\u5206\u6790\u4e86 peculiar \u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179 boost \u5728\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u751f\u6210 Eulerian \u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u975e\u96f6\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u7684\u65e0\u65cb\u3001\u65e0\u526a\u5207\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u7b49\u8ddd\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u76843\u7ef4 peculiar \u901f\u5ea6\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982 CMB \u9e22auction\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u4f53\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e CMB \u5e27\u7684 peculiar \u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e CMB \u9e22auction \u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u5b9a\u8d28\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 peculiar \u901f\u5ea6\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982 CMB\uff09\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u725b\u987f\u7684\u7eb5\u5750\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u65e0\u65cb\u3001\u65e0\u526a\u5207\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u751f\u6210Eulerian \u5750\u6807\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u7814\u7a76\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179 boost \u751f\u6210\u7684 peculiar velocity \u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9664\u975e\u53e6\u6709\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5747\u4e3a \u4f5c\u8005\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u4e0e Stack Overflow \u6216\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u673a\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86 peculiar velocity \u8ddf\u968f CMB \u5e27\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179 boost \u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u76843\u7ef4 peculiar \u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 CMB \u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Accepted by PRA", "summary": "Non-Hermitian photonics provides a fertile platform for exploring phenomena with no Hermitian counterparts, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, with direct relevance for integrated photonic technologies. In this work, we investigate the properties of non-Hermitian second-order topological phases by constructing a photonic kagome crystal with balanced gain and loss, and reveal the interplay between higher-order topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect. We demonstrate that non-Hermiticity not only lifts the degeneracy of the topological corner modes but also drives bulk states to accumulate at corners, giving rise to bipolar non-Hermitian skin effect. By defining the point-gap topology, we uncover the fundamental topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect. More interestingly, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces a fundamental breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence based on the Bloch band theory.

Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter.

In particular, these discord-like and information-theoretic measures provide the largest baseline and persist even in parameter regions where entanglement vanishes, highlighting their suitability as a quantumness witness in realistic conditions. Notably, our Bell nonlocality study is tailored to the asymmetric qubit-qutrit setting by exploiting a recently developed qubit-qudit CHSH maximization framework. However, Bell nonlocality is confirmed to be the most fragile, surviving only in narrow parameter windows at low temperature. A key finding of this work is that we observe the fragility hierarchy: Bell nonlocality < Negativity < UIN(MIN) in the qubit-qutrit setting. These results provide deeper insight into the relative robustness of distinct quantum resources in anisotropic qubit-qutrit models, suggesting that quantum discord-like measures, such as MIN and UIN, may serve as more practical resources than entanglement for quantum information tasks in thermally active spin systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel.

Such global anomalies can be canceled by anomalous symmetry-preserving topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which contain no local point operators but only extended excitations such as line and surface operators. In this work, we study mixed gauge-gravitational nonperturbative global anomalies of Weyl fermions (or Weyl semimetals in condensed matter) charged under discrete Abelian internal symmetries in four-dimensional spacetime, with spacetime-internal fermionic symmetry $G=$Spin$\\times_{\\mathbb{Z}_2^{\\rm F}}\\mathbb{Z}_{2m}^{\\rm F}$ or Spin$\\times\\mathbb{Z}_n$ that contains fermion parity $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\\rm F}$. We determine the minimal finite gauge group $K$ of anomalous $G$-symmetric TQFTs that can match the fermionic anomaly via the symmetry-extension construction $1 \\to K \\to G_{\\rm Tot} \\to G \\to 1$, where the anomaly in $G$ is trivialized upon pullback to $G_{\\rm Tot}$, computed by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer eta invariant. This allows one to replace a $G$-symmetric four-dimensional Weyl fermion by an anomalous $G$-symmetric discrete-$K$-gauge TQFT as an alternative low-energy theory in the same deformation class. As an application, we show that the four-dimensional Standard Model with 15 Weyl fermions per family, in the absence of a sterile right-handed neutrino $\u03bd_R$, exhibits mixed gauge-gravitational global anomalies between baryon and lepton number symmetries $({\\bf B \\pm L})$ and spacetime diffeomorphisms. We identify the corresponding minimal $K$-gauge fermionic TQFT that cancels these anomalies and can be interpreted as a gapped, topologically ordered dark sector replacing missing Weyl fermions via symmetry extension, without invoking conventional Anderson-Higgs symmetry breaking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u79bb\u6563\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u5168\u5c40\u2019t-Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b50\u6784\u9020\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6709\u9650\u89c4\u8303\u7fa4K\uff0c\u4ee5\u5339\u914dWeyl fermion\u7684\u573a\u8bba\u53cd\u8eab\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d88\u9664\u5927\u522b\u6570\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5f02\u5e38\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0fK-\u89c4\u8303\u8d85\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u7f3a\u5931Weyl fermion\u7684\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u6697\u7269\u8d28\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Anders-Higgs\u5bf9\u79f0\u7834\u7f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u2019t-Hooft\u5f02\u5e38\u53ca\u5176\u6392\u9664\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u548c condensed matter \u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7anol\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u6784\u9020\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u6709\u9650\u89c4\u8303\u7fa4K\uff0c\u5e76\u7528Atiyah-Patodi-Singereta\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86 anomaly\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6d88\u9664\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5927\u522b\u6570\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5f02\u5e38\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0fK-\u89c4\u8303\u8d85\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6d88\u9664\u56db\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5927\u522b\u6570\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u6df7\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

In particular, the piezoelectric response of materials such as lithium niobate enables coupling between superconducting qubits and gigahertz-frequency phonons. However, bulk lithium niobate phononic devices typically rely on surface acoustic waves and are therefore inherently subject to leakage from the surface into the bulk substrate. Here, we explore the acoustic behavior of resonator cavities supporting GHz-frequency Lamb waves in a 200 nm-thick suspended lithium niobate layer. We characterize the acoustic response at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We find that our resonator cavities with strong confinement reach intrinsic quality factors of approximately 6000 at the single phonon level.

Like the operator nonstabilizerness, both these quantities are defined from the expansion of time-evolved operators in the Pauli basis. They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u65e0\u5e8f\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u53bb\u5c40\u57df\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5728\u6ce1\u5229\u57fa\u4e0b\u7684\u5c55\u5f00\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8868\u793a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u70b9\u6570\u548c\u652f\u6491\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u79ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff08MPS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5728\u65e0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684XXZ\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u53ca\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u8fc5\u901f\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0 scrambling\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u57df\u5316\uff08MBL\uff09 regime\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u610f\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u91cf\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u5747\u5448\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684 MBL \u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u5149\u9525\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8be5\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548 $\textit{l}$-bit \u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u91cf\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u53bb\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u5728\u65e0\u5e8f\u4e00\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528 MPS \u6846\u67b6\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5229\u7528 MPS \u6846\u67b6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u70b9\u6570\u4e0e\u652f\u6491\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u8fc5\u901f\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u65e0 scrambling\uff1b\u5728 MBL \u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u589e\u957f\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u5b8c\u6574\u8868\u5f81\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u53bb\u5c40\u57df\u5316\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u5e8f\u4e00\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb\u94fe\u4e2d\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u5728 MPS \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u548cAnderson\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To eliminate the statistical errors due to variable and usually arbitrary sampling of the directions in a color point, we integrate the measures over a complete ellipsoid/ellipse. It turns out that in the limit for small deviations from circularity all proposed measures ($V_{AB}$, $\u03b3-1$, $CV$ and $\\mathrm{STRESS}$) are equivalent. For greater deviations the measures become distinct with $\u03b3-1$ the most sensitive and $\\mathrm{STRESS}$ the least. Ideally a difference measure should be coordinate independent and then it is advantageous to apply an affine transformation to both sets, e.g. turning the theoretical one into the unit ball. Although MacAdam already used this method but sampled the transformed ellipse, we integrate over the ellipsoid/ellipse. Comparing the results with the base measures we show that only $\\mathrm{STRESS}$ is coordinate independent. Judging whether a single ellipsoid/ellipse resembles a unit ball can easily be done by comparing the eigenvalues with one and we show that our previously proposed error measure $d_{ev}$ (Candry e.a. Optics Express, 30, 36307, 2022) is the eigenvalue version of $\u03b3-1$. We show why the short lived correlation coefficient $r$ was justly abandoned, being very coordinate dependent, but that Pant's recent geometric measure $1-R$ on the other hand is coordinate independent. All measures are routinely made scale invariant by the introduction of a scaling parameter, to be optimized. Lastly we show that from all measures the $\u03b3-1$ ones are the only ones permitting the simple derivation of the globally optimized difference measure from the locally defined ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper compares various measures for assessing color differences, concluding that only STRESS is coordinate-independent.

However, probing the strength and nature of SOI is a significant challenge, especially in heterostructures. Here, we consider the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas (NSdH) effect, a quantum oscillatory effect that occurs under conditions similar to those of the well-known SdH effect, but is second order in the applied electric field. We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI. In particular, we show that the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations in nonlinear conductivities can clearly distinguish between different types of SOI. As a demonstration, we show how NSdH can distinguish between the linear and cubic Rashba couplings that are expected in germanium heterostructures.

In this work, we bridge the gap between quantum information geometry and stochastic thermodynamics by introducing the Conditional Quantum Fisher Information (CQFI). Defined via the Symmetric Logarithmic Derivative, the CQFI generalizes the classical stochastic Fisher information to the quantum domain. We demonstrate that the CQFI admits a decomposition into incoherent (population) and coherent (basis rotation) contributions, augmented by a transient interference cross-term absent at the ensemble level.

Single-photon polymerization ensures rapid polymerization of centimeter-scale structures with features on the order of tens of micrometers, whereas 2PP provides sub-micrometer features at sub-millimeter scales. Here, we introduce a hybrid unified 3D printer that leverages the complementary strengths of both printing mechanisms to bridge this scale-resolution gap. We propose integrating 2PP for high-resolution, localized spatial control with single-photon TVAM for enabling rapid, high-throughput 3D fabrication. In this approach, TVAM first forms millimeter-scale volumetric structures attached on a glass rod, via overprinting, which is then accessible for subsequent high-resolution 2PP. Without needing to change the photoresin or introducing intermediate post-processing steps, we demonstrate finely printed structures via 2PP using a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam, fabricated both inside and on the surface of the millimeter-scale 3D objects printed with TVAM. Here, TVAM contributes by generating a pre-polymerized volume that facilitates subsequent 2PP and by directly driving volumetric polymerization in designated regions within seconds. We experimentally demonstrate that this dual-mode strategy provides a scalable approach for rapidly fabricating millimeter-scale 3D structures featuring sub-micrometer details. For applications like bioscaffolds and tissue engineering, tens of micrometer-scale features are sufficient across the majority of the volume with higher resolution confined to localized functional regions.

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance.

Under extreme anisotropy, we observe a pronounced directional channeling effect, driven by anomalous symmetry-breaking velocity diffusion, which concentrates light propagation along preferential directions while suppressing transverse spreading. These findings establish a tunable material platform for harnessing branched flow of light, opening pathways toward on-chip photonic circuits that exploit disorder-guided transport, scattering-resilient endoscopic imaging, and adaptive optical interfaces in complex media.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6db2\u6676\u5149\u6805\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u7684\u5206\u53c9\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u81f4\u6210\u5f62\u7f16\u7a0b\u5149\u52bf\u573a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u5149\u548c\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u5411Builder\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u5149\u5b50ics\u4e0e\u4e9a\u5fae\u6ce2\u6ce2\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u666e\u9002\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u5411 channels\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7531\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6269\u6563\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5149\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u5411While\u51cf\u5c11\u6a2a\u5411\u6269\u6563\u3002\u8be5\u6210\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8c03\u8c10\u6750\u6599\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bf4\u4e0d\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u5206\u5149\uff0c\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u5149\u8def\u7684\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u5c04\u6291\u5236\u7aef\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u754c\u9762\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5149\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ecb\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u65b9\u5f0f\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6db2\u6676\u5149\u6805\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5149\u7684\u5206\u53c9\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5185\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u81f4\u6210\u5f62\u6280\u672f\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7\u6db2\u6676\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6392\u5217\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u521b\u9020\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u5149\u52bf\u573a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u5bfc\u6ce2\u69fd\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u7a0b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u5149\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5149\u81f4\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5149\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6db2\u6676\u5149\u6805\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u5206\u88c2\u548c\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u5149\u81f4\u6210\u5f62\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5149\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5149\u7ebf\u6cbf\u7740\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45 suppress \u6a2a\u5411\u6269\u6563\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u9002\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6cd5\u5219\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8c03\u8c10\u6750\u6599\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5149\u548c\u5149\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5149\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6563\u5c04\u6291\u5236\u7684\u7aef\u955c\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u754c\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7531\u6b64\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u5171\u9700 messing\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u8fd0\u8f93\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer R\u00e9nyi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u6db2\u53cc\u6001\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668 R\u00e9nyi \u71b5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u8c31\u5f62\u5f0f\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u5668 R\u00e9nyi \u71b5\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u8c31\u5f62\u5f0f\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528 Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev \u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u65cb\u8868\u793a\u548c Z2 \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u7a33\u5b9a\u5668 R\u00e9nyi \u71b5\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2. \u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u662f\u6709\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u76f8\u53d8\u4f34\u968f Z2 \u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff1b3. \u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u9b54\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Threefold-symmetric signals under in-plane fields are often attributed to such quantum mechanisms. Here, we establish a purely classical origin for a three-fold-symmetric PHE. The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals.

Employing the relative entropy of coherence as a circuit-level resource measure, we show that multipartite resource states relevant to generalized superdense coding can enable scalable communication while exhibiting only logarithmic or even constant coherence growth, depending on their entanglement structure. In sharp contrast, quantum teleportation displays an unavoidable, protocol-induced coherence cost that grows linearly with the number of teleported qubits and is independent of the input state. Through a stage-resolved analysis of the teleportation circuit, we separate protocol-generated coherence from message-dependent contributions and identify a universal two-bit coherence offset per teleported qubit at the maximal-coherence stage. We further demonstrate explicitly that this extensive intermediate coherence generation is fully consistent with information-theoretic bounds, including the Holevo limit, and does not correspond to an increase in accessible classical information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u91cd\u5206\u53d1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u8303\u4f8b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d85\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u751a\u81f3\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u6001\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u3001\u7531\u534f\u8bae\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8be5\u6210\u672c\u968f\u7740\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u6570\u91cf\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4f20\u6001\u7535\u8def\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5206\u79bb\u5f00\u6765\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u65f6\u6bcf\u4f20\u8f93\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5e72\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u660e\u786e\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u5927\u91cf\u4e2d\u95f4\u76f8\u5e72\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u754c\u8bf4\u7684\u970d\u592b\u5947\u9650\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e00\u70b9\u90fd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u548c\u8d85\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u7b49\u5178\u578b\u8303\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u7684\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u591a\u7c92\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d85\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6570\u751a\u81f3\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u9690\u5f62\u4f20\u6001\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u6001\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u76f8\u5e72\u6001\u65f6\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5e72\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u8d85\u5bc6\u96c6\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Here, we report an on-chip silicon-based integrated photodetector that directly converts optical OAM into distinguishable electrical signals without bulky interferometric or imaging optics. By leveraging a momentum-matched plasmonic coupling mechanism, the device maps vortex beams onto surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) with OAM-dependent splitting angles, thereby generating photocurrents that uniquely encode the topological charge. The incorporation of a surface dielectric lens and a split-electrode architecture further enhances mode resolution and enables chirality discrimination. The device demonstrates a wide topological charge detection range from m = -9 to 9 and achieves a record-high average OAM responsivity of 226 nA/W.

Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation.

Complementarily, we obtain certified upper bounds on fidelity by variational lower bounds on the trace distance through the same framework. We demonstrate the power of this approach with two examples: fidelity correlators in critical mixed states, and codeword distinguishability in an approximate quantum error-correcting code. Remarkably, the variational lower bound accurately track the universal scaling behavior of the fidelity with a size-consistent relative error, allowing for the extraction of previously unknown critical exponents.

Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This situation represents one of the most important problems in the field of quantum information technologies. While existing data-driven methods struggle to generalize beyond the training data (extrapolation), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) require predefined governing equations, which limit their discovery capability when the underlying physics is incomplete or unknown. In this work, we present the ParaQNN (ParaQuantum neural network) architecture, an equation-free framework for physical discovery. ParaQNN disentangles multi-scale dynamics without relying on a priori laws by employing a dialetheist logic layer that models coherent signal and decoherent noise as independent yet interacting channels. Through extensive benchmark tests performed on Rabi oscillations, Lindblad dynamics, and particularly complex ``mixed regimes'' where relaxation and dephasing processes compete, we show that ParaQNN exhibits a consistent performance advantage compared to Random Forest, XGBoost, and PINN models with incomplete physical information. Unlike its competitors, ParaQNN succeeds in maintaining oscillatory and damping dynamics with high accuracy even in extrapolation regions where training data are unavailable, by ``discovering'' the underlying structural invariants from noisy measurements.

We study this question in an arena where computation, learning, and causality collide. A twist on Grover's search that reflects about an a priori unknown state can collapse the query complexity from $O(\\sqrt{N})$ to $O(\\log N)$ over a search space $N$, i.e., an exponential speedup. Yet, standard quantum theory forbids such a unknown-state reflection (no-reflection theorem). We therefore build a state-learning-assisted architecture, called ``amplify-learn,'' which alternates the coherent amplitude amplification with state learning. Embedding this amplify-learn into the Bao-Bouland-Jordan no-signaling framework, we show that the logarithmic-round dream would open a super-luminal communication channel unless each round expends the learning-sample and reflection-circuit budgets scaling at least as $\u03a9(\\sqrt{N}/\\log N)$. In parallel, we derive tight computational learning-theoretic sample bounds for learning circuit-generated pure states, revealing a state-universal ansatz ``lock'' at order $N$ in the worst case. The dramatic closure is that no-signaling does not merely veto the unphysical primitive, but it fixes the only consistent reflection-circuit complexity, and feeding this causality-enforced complexity into the computational learning bound makes it collapse onto the very same $\\sqrt{N}/\\log N$ scaling demanded by no-signaling alone. No-signaling thus acts as a regulator of learnability: a constraint that mediates between physics and computation, welding query, gate, and sample complexities into a single causality-compatible triangle.", "AI": {"tldr": "No-signaling prevents a quantum search algorithm from exponentially speeding up by enforcing a lower bound on reflection circuit complexity and limiting state learning to O(sqrt(N)/log N) samples.", "motivation": "Understanding the limits of quantum learning algorithms and their interplay with physical laws.", "method": "Bao-Bouland-Jordan framework with amplify-learn architecture and sample complexity calculations.", "result": "No-signaling fixes reflection complexity and tightens state learning bounds, collapsing query, gate, and sample complexities into a causality-compatible framework.", "conclusion": "No-signaling acts as a regulator, balancing quantum speedups with learnability constraints."}}

By free, we mean that there is no potential within the interval and that its walls are penetrable; hence, the pertinent energy current density does not vanish at the walls. Certainly, quantization in an interval is not trivial because certain restrictions imposed by the domains of the operators involved arise. Here, our objective is to obtain the Hamiltonian for these particles. In practice, the Feshbach-Villars (FV)--free Hamiltonian is the proper operator for characterizing them and is a function of the momentum operator. Additionally, a Majorana condition must also be imposed on the wavefunctions on which these two operators can act. Thus, we start by calculating the pseudo self-adjoint momentum operator. A three-parameter set of boundary conditions (BCs) constitutes its domain. Up to this point, the domain of the Hamiltonian is induced by the domain of the momentum operator; however, we ensure that only the BCs for which the energy current density has the same value at each end of the interval are in its domain. All these BCs essentially belong to a one-parameter set of BCs. Moreover, because the FV equation is invariant under the operation of parity, the parity-transformed wavefunction is also a solution of this equation, which further restricts the domain of the free FV Hamiltonian. Finally, knowing the most general three-parameter set of BCs for the pseudo self-adjoint FV Hamiltonian for a 1D KFGM particle in an interval, we find that only two BCs can remain within the domain of the FV--free Hamiltonian: the periodic BC and the antiperiodic BC.

Recent advances in atomic-scale tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have enabled vibrational mapping of single molecules with sub-nanometer spatial resolution, providing unprecedented insights into molecule-surface interactions by confining light in plasmonic picocavities. Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes. Our findings not only demonstrate the first use of sub-nanometer TERS mapping across different symmetry configurations but also provide a deeper understanding of how site-specific vibrational properties are intimately linked to local atomic environments.

The platform is modular, where each three-mode optomechanical system serves as a fundamental building block. Operating independently, a single block achieves nonreciprocity for classical fields. Specifically, asymmetric radiation pressure from intrinsic optomechanical nonlinearity induces nonreciprocal mechanical displacement, modulating the cavity intensity through optomechanical feedback. This enables full isolation of backward transmission without requiring parameter initialization. Alternatively, for quantum signals, the platform is reconfigured by activating photonic and phononic exchange channels between the two blocks. In this configuration, nonreciprocity arises from quantum interference between direct photon hopping and indirect conversion pathways. Constructive interference enables unidirectional low-loss transmission, while destructive interference completely suppresses the reverse direction. After adiabatically eliminating the auxiliary modes, the optimal nonreciprocal frequency and the trade-off between insertion loss and nonreciprocal bandwidth can be controlled by engineering optomechanically induced mechanical dissipation.

The potential arises from the image charges that form in the grounded planes, along with the added condition that at x = 0, L, where L is the distance between the planes, the wavefunction must be zero. This effectively couples a hydrogen like system to a particle-in-a-box (PIB) based on L, the distance between the planes. The problem of finding the electrostatic potential of this infinite series of image charges is an old one, going back to at least 1929. Here, we give a short derivation for one of the limiting cases that yields a compact expression and show how the Kellogg infinite summation formula converges to that value. We note here that this potential is a symmetric double well potential, so there will be many familiar properties of its solutions. Then using that potential, we solve Schr\u00f6dinger's equation using a spectral technique.

In this interferometric framework, we present entropic wave-particle duality relations between quantum coherence, characterized by the relative entropy of coherence of the quanton state, and which-path knowledge, quantified by the mutual information obtained through detector-state discrimination. By applying a general optimal discrimination measurement, which has a closed-form solution and encompasses other fundamental strategies as special cases, we provide an exact quantification of which-path knowledge in a variety of scenarios. This measurement is carried out in two steps. First, an optimal separation map with a prescribed separation level $\u03be\\in [0,1]$ probabilistically reduces the overlaps between the input detector states with maximum success rate, or increases them in case of failure. Then, a minimum-error (ME) measurement discriminates either only the successful outputs (standard approach) or both the successful and failure outputs (concatenated approach). We show that the duality relation is tighter at $\u03be=0$, where both approaches reduce to the ME measurement. For $\u03be>0$, each approach yields a distinct relation that becomes less tight as $\u03be$ increases, with the concatenated one providing the tighter bound. Finally, by using the discrete uncertainty principle, we determine the sets of detector states that lead to saturation of the duality relation, showing that they span $n$-dimensional subspaces of the detector space, where $n$ divides $N$. As a result, nontrivial saturation occurs only for interferometers with a nonprime number of paths. From the identified saturating sets, we highlight how the quanton-detector correlations underlie this phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606fifiers\u7684\u6ce2\u7c92\u4e8c\u4e49\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u8868\u5f81\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6ce2\u7c92\u4e8c\u4e49\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f97\u5230\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u71b5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u68c0\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u8fa8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u5206\u79bb\u6c34\u5e73\u03be\u4e3a0\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u6761\u5206\u8fa8\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4e92\u91cd\u5408\u3002\u968f\u7740\u03be\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u540e\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u754c\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4f7f\u5f97\u6ce2\u7c92\u5173\u7cfb\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u6570\u5fc5\u987b\u6574\u9664\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u76eeN\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u4e2d\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4fe1\u606fifiers\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce2\u7c92\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u76ee\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6307\u51fa\u975e\u7d20\u6570\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u76ee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002"}}

Our platform employs a bulk lithium niobate crystal whose large dielectric constant creates wavelength-scale confinement of microwave photons. By incorporating this crystal within a high-finesse Fabry - Perot optical cavity, microwave photons couple to optical photons through the electro-optic effect. We demonstrate the ability to tune our system into triply resonant operation, where microwave photons, optical pump photons, and upconverted optical photons are simultaneously resonant with high quality factor electromagnetic modes of the system. The device achieves photon number conversion efficiency at the percent level, comparable to state-of-the-art devices at room temperature -- sufficient to resolve the thermal occupation of the microwave mode -- while avoiding the noise and loss associated with metal electrodes. These results establish our all-dielectric devices as a promising platform for high-precision sensing of optically detected microwave fields and as a viable route toward single-photon-level microwave - optical quantum transduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

(2) A new POVM bound where e prove that any measurement achieving $(1 - \u03b5)$ success on one basis has conjugate-basis guessing probability at most $\\frac{1}{2m} + O(\u03b5^\\frac{1}{4})$. (3) Simultation-secure OTMs in the quantum random oracle model where an adversary can only query the random oracle classically. (4) Adaptive depth security where, via an informal application of a lifting theorem from Arora et al., we conjecture security against adversaries with polynomial quantum circuit depth between random oracle queries.\n  Security against adaptive, depth-bounded, quantum adversaries captures many realistic attacks on OTMs built from single-qubit states; our work thus paves the way for practical and truly secure one-time programs.

Our approach investigates the interplay between the dispersive response and the relative center-of-mass motion of two ground-state atoms. This coupling yields a quantum force, which can be expressed as a power series in the velocity. The significance of each contribution depends on its order parity: while even-order terms are reversible, odd-order terms are irreversible and only survive in the presence of an internal dissipation mechanism. In addition, we obtain general, model-independent properties for the work performed by these contributions for arbitrary scattering trajectories. These results enable an unambiguous identification of odd-parity terms with microscopic quantum friction. At room temperature, the dominant microscopic quantum friction is of first order in the velocity and presents a strong quantum character. Our microscopic theory reveals that several properties of quantum friction obtained in specific settings -- such as the cubic dependence on velocity at zero temperature -- are indeed universal features already present at the atomic scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We present numerical evidence that challenges this consensus. Through experiments on quantum graph neural networks for molecular property prediction, we discover that quantum noise induces heterogeneous, initialization-dependent responses. Among randomly initialized models with identical architecture, approximately one-third show performance improvement under moderate noise, while a smaller fraction deteriorate and the remainder are marginally affected. We identify a strong negative correlation ($r = -0.62$) between baseline model performance and noise benefit, suggesting that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for under-optimized models while disrupting well-converged ones. The observed optimal noise level falls below theoretical predictions, indicating error cancellation in structured quantum circuits. These findings demonstrate that quantum noise effects depend critically on initialization quality and need not be uniformly detrimental, suggesting a shift from universal noise mitigation toward structure- and noise-aware optimization strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u975e\u5bf9\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u5fc5\u987b\u514b\u670d\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u6311\u6218\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fd1\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u969c\u788d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5171\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ea61/3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08r=-0.62\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u6b20\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6b63\u5411\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u5df2\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6700\u4f18\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u5747\u4e0d\u5229\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

One method of fault-tolerant state preparation is to initialize multiple ancilla states and check them against each other to detect problematic errors. In the worst case, the number of states required for successful initialization grows polynomially with the code distance, but it has been shown that this can be reduced to constant ancilla overhead-in the best case, only four states are required. However, existing techniques for finding low-overhead initialization schemes are limited to codes with large symmetry groups, such as the Golay code. In this work, we propose a general, automated synthesis methodology for Steane-type fault-tolerant state preparation circuits that applies to arbitrary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and does not rely on code symmetries. We apply the proposed methods to various CSS codes up to a distance of seven and simulate the successful fault-tolerant initialization of logical basis states under circuit-level depolarizing noise. The circuits synthesized using the proposed methodology provide an important step towards experimental realizations of high-fidelity ancilla states for near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "A paper proposing an automated method for synthesizing fault-tolerant initialization circuits for Steane-type codes, applicable to arbitrary CSS codes, not relying on code symmetry.

We propose a method to remove parametric controlled rotations whose small rotation angles do not justify the routing overhead required for their implementation.

Our approach evaluates whether executing a gate leads to greater fidelity loss than omitting it. Simulations on benchmark circuits with realistic noise models show that the method reduces two-qubit gate counts (up to 48.6%) while improving final state fidelity (up to 47.7%), especially for larger circuits where routing costs dominate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8def\u7531\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4eNISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed5\u9053\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u95e8\u8def\u7684\u6267\u884c fidelity\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e24\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u526a\u679d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684 fidelity\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8bbe\u5907\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97 fidelity\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e fidelity\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u6761\u95e8\u8def\u5728\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u6240\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\u548c fidelity\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u9884\u5b9a\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u90e8\u5206\u5f15\u5165\u8f83\u9ad8\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e14 fidelity\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u5927\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u95e8\u8def\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684 fidelity\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u572818\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8648.6%\u7684\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u800c fidelity\u635f\u5931\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea61.3%\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5360\u6bd4\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ed5\u9053\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684 fidelity\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e fidelity\u635f\u5931\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5728NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u95e8\u8def\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u4f30\u7b97\u7ed5\u9053\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e0e fidelity\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u54ea\u4e9b\u95e8\u8def\u503c\u5f97\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u54ea\u4e9b\u95e8\u8def\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u526a\u679d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e24\u6bd4\u7279\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684 fidelity\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These protocols are attracting significant interest: they can stabilize nonequilibrium stationary states, generate correlations in noninteracting systems, and enable optimal search strategies. While a constant reset probability results in a Markovian dynamics, much less is known about non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting. Here, we analyze memory effects in these processes -- examining the evolution of quantum states and of observables -- through witnesses of non-Markovianity for open quantum systems. We focus on discrete-time reset processes, which are of particular interest as they can be implemented on existing gate-operated quantum devices. We show that these processes are generically described by non-divisible maps and, in non-classical scenarios where the effective reset probability can become negative, can feature revivals in the state distinguishability.

We analyze how the two main fusion operations, Type-I and Type-II, act on weighted graph states. Type-I fusion operates identically to the unweighted case, merging two one-dimensional weighted graphs, while preserving edge weights and success probabilities. In addition, the pool of 2-qubit weighted graph states can be generated easily by GHZ states or Bell pairs. In contrast, Type-II fusion requires a logical qubit, which can be formed only for specific weight configurations, and with success probability below one-half, which is an obstacle one can avoid. When successful, it fuses the states correctly, but its failure outcomes destroy the structure of the graphs, removing the good-failure feature, known from ordinary graph states. We compute the entanglement reduction of the resulting link due to the fused states being weighted graph states (for generalized fusion), and classify the resulting states of a general non-Bell projection. These results define the practical limits of the fusion-based construction of weighted graph states for MBQC.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By analytically solving a non-uniform, non-reciprocal SSH model, we demonstrate that the intrinsic inhomogeneous coupling, in combination with nonreciprocity, fundamentally modifies the conventional skin effect. Instead of accumulating at the physical boundary, all eigenmodes become compressed and skewed within a finite spatial range determined by the inhomogeneous profile-a phenomenon we term the confined non-Hermitian skin effect. Consequently, the evolution of the probability distribution on the lattice starting from a single site is doubly confined: it is spatially bounded to a finite range by the inhomogeneous coupling, and further restricted to a one-sided trajectory at the edge of this range by the non-reciprocity. Moreover, a feasible experimental scheme based on a single trapped ion is also proposed.

Despite recent progress, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental precision limits of continuous metrology with bosonic systems is currently lacking. We develop a general theoretical framework for quantum metrology with multimode free bosons under continuous Gaussian measurements. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic growth rates of the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the environmental QFI, which quantify the total information encoded in the joint system-environment state and the information accessible from the emitted radiation, respectively. We derive fundamental bounds on these quantities, showing that while Heisenberg-type scaling with the number of modes is attainable, the precision scales at most linearly with time and a meaningful energy resource. To illustrate our findings, we analyze several concrete setups, including coupled cavity arrays and trapped particle arrays. While a local setup yields a standard linear scaling with resources, a globally coupled setup can achieve the optimal quadratic scaling in terms of the mode number.

While satellite platforms have demonstrated thousand-kilometer entanglement distribution, quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation with ground, future constellations and deep-space missions demand photon sources that are robust, compact, and power-efficient. Integrated photonics offers a scalable solution, yet a critical spectral gap persists. Although telecom-band integrated photon-pair sources are well established, near-visible photons offer distinct advantages for satellite-to-ground links by mitigating diffraction loss and maximizing the collection efficiency of optical telescopes. Scalable integrated sources in this regime have remained elusive due to the fundamental challenge of achieving anomalous dispersion in materials transparent at visible wavelengths. Here we bridge this gap by demonstrating an integrated near-visible photon-pair source based on a wide-bandgap, ultralow-loss, silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator. By engineering the dispersion of higher-order waveguide modes, we overcome the intrinsic normal dispersion limit to achieve efficient phase matching.

We report high-purity heralded single-photon generation with a heralding rate up to 2.3 MHz and a second-order correlation function as low as 0.0041. Furthermore, we observe energy-time entanglement with 98.4% interference visibility, violating the CHSH limit even at flux exceeding 40.6 million pairs/s.

Measurement-free quantum error correction (mfec) replaces repeated measurements and classical feed-forward by coherent quantum feedback, but existing mfec protocols suffer from severe connectivity overhead when mapped to planar surface-code architectures: transversal interactions between logical patches require SWAP chains of length $O(d)$ in the code distance, which increase depth and generate hook errors. This work introduces a 3D stacked surface-code architecture for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction that removes this connectivity bottleneck. Vertical transversal couplers between aligned surface-code patches enable coherent parity mapping and feedback with zero SWAP overhead, realizing constant-depth $O(1)$ inter-layer operations in d while preserving local 2D stabilizer checks. A fault-tolerant mfec protocol for the surface code is constructed that suppresses hook errors under realistic noise. An analytical performance model shows that the 3D architecture overcomes the readout error floor and achieves logical error rates orders of magnitude below both standard measurement-based surface codes and 2D mfec variants in regimes with slow, noisy measurements, identifying 3D integration as a key enabler for scalable measurement-free fault tolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new 3D stacked surface-code architecture enables measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction with no connectivity overhead, surpassing limitations of traditional approaches.", "motivation": "Developing scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, especially in reducing error rates and integrating quantum components effectively.", "method": "The authors propose a 3D stacked surface-code architecture utilizing vertical transversal couplers to facilitate intra-layer operations without requiring SWAP chains, thereby eliminating connectivity overhead.

However, the optical emission frequencies in this approach are subject to temporal fluctuations on both long and short timescales, which hinders the development of quantum applications. Here, we investigate this limitation and demonstrate that it can be alleviated by integrating the emitters into Fabry-Perot instead of nanophotonic resonators. Their larger optical mode volume enables both increasing the distance to crystal surfaces and operating at a lower dopant concentration, which reduces implantation-induced crystal damage and interactions between emitters. As a result, we observe a fivefold reduction of the spectral diffusion linewidth down to 4.0(2) MHz. Calculations and experimental investigations of isotopically purified 28-Si crystals suggest that the remaining spectral instability is caused by laser-induced electric-field fluctuations. In direct comparison with a nanophotonic device, the instability is significantly reduced at the same intracavity power, enabling a tenfold increase of the optical coherence time up to 20(1) microseconds.

Its applicability, however, is challenged by the existence of anomalous bunching, namely paradoxical situations in which partially distinguishable particles exhibit a higher bunching probability in two or more modes than perfectly indistinguishable ones. Using multimode bunching as a reliable criterion of genuine indistinguishability, therefore, requires a clear identification of the interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching can or cannot occur. In particular, since uncontrolled small time delays between single-photon pulses constitute a common source of mode mismatch in current photonic platforms, it is essential to determine whether the resulting photon distinguishability might lead to anomalous bunching. Here, we first identify a broad class of interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching is rigorously excluded, thereby establishing regimes where multimode bunching-based validation remains valid. Then, we find that, quite unexpectedly, temporal mode mismatch does not belong to this class.

Furthermore, we address the quantum state estimation problem by propagating two trajectories under the same measurement record--one from the true initial state and the other from an arbitrary initial guess--and show that the estimated trajectory converges exponentially fast to the true one, thus quantifying the rate at which information is progressively revealed through the measurement process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u2018\u6697\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u2019\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cK\u00fcmmerer\u548cMaassen\u66fe\u8bc1\u660e\u8fc7\u8fd9\u7c7b\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5185\u51e0\u4e4e\u4f1a\u7eaf\u5316\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u7528Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7eaf\u5316\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0b\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u2014one\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u2014\u8fdb\u884c\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7eaf\u5316\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u5230\u4e86Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7eaf\u5316\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "1. \u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u957f\u671f\u5185\u51e0\u4e4e\u4f1a\u7eaf\u5316\u30022. \u7eaf\u5316\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0b\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u53d1\u751f\u30023. \u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Lyapunov\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u7eaf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, as they get larger, they present computational challenges for classical solvers within practical time limits. Quantum annealers can, in principle, accelerate the solution of problems formulated as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization instances, but their limited scale currently prevents achieving practical speedups. Quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of both paradigms and to allow current quantum computers to be used in larger problems. In this work, a hardware-agnostic Benders' decomposition algorithm and a series of enhancements with the goal of taking the most advantage of quantum computing are presented. The decomposition consists of a master problem with integer variables, which is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem and solved with a quantum annealer, and a linear subproblem solved by a classical computer. The enhancements consist, among others, of different embedding processes that substantially reduce the pre-processing time of the embedding computation without compromising solution quality, a conservative handling of cut constraints, and a stopping criterion that accounts for the limited size of current quantum computers and their heuristic nature. The proposed algorithm is benchmarked against classical approaches using a D-Wave quantum annealer for a scalable family of transmission network expansion planning problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In finite-dimensional systems, this is justified by the fact that noncontextual theories can be embedded into some simplex, i.e. into a classical theory. We show that a direct application of the standard definition of generalized contextuality to continuous variable systems does not envelope the statistics of some basic measurements, such as the position observable. In other words, we construct families of fully classical, i.e. commuting, measurements that nevertheless can be used to show contextuality of quantum theory. To overcome the apparent disagreement between the two notions of classicality, that is commutativity and noncontextuality, we propose a modified definition of generalised contextuality for continuous-variable systems. The modified definition is based on a physically-motivated approximation procedure, that uses only finite sets of measurement effects. We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions. In the process, we discuss the extension of a known connection between contextuality and no-broadcasting to the continuous-variable scenario, and prove structural results regarding fixed points of infinite-dimensional entanglement breaking channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8868\u660e\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u88ab\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u67d0\u4e2a\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\uff0c\u5373\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u5f97\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u4f46\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u65f6\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u57fa\u672c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6070\u597d\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u975e\u6784\u9020\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u5e7f\u64ad\u5b9a\u7406\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u7ea0\u7f20\u7834\u574f\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u70b9\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5b8c\u5168\u7ecf\u5178\uff08\u5373\u4ea4\u6362\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u91cf\u6548\u5e94\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "1. \u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u30022. \u8be5\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u975e\u6784\u9020\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u30023. \u5ef6\u5c55\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u5e7f\u64ad\u5b9a\u7406\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u30024. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u7ea0\u7f20\u7834\u574f\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u70b9\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\uff08\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Phys. A", "summary": "We unveil a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect enabled by the Liouvillian skin effect in a dissipative tight-binding chain with asymmetric incoherent hopping and coherent boundary coupling. The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\\rm R} \\neq J_{\\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $\u03b5$. For $\u03b5=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $\u03b5=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\\rm R}=J_{\\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes.

Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed \"information lattice\" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u8f93\u8fd0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u8f93\u8fd0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u548c\u4fdderved\u91cf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u8fd1\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u683c\u67b6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u683c\u67b6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Lindblad master equations\u5206\u6790\u975e\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8d39\u7c73\u94fe\u4e0e\u8017\u6563\u70ed\u5e93\u7684\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u566a\u58f0\u683c\u67b6\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u6d41\u3001 onsite \u5360\u636e\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u53ca\u7c92\u5b50\u6d41\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8d39\u7c73\u6027\u8d1f\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u53cc\u90e8\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u8fd0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u7c92\u5b50- hole\u5bf9\u79f0\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u88ab\u4fe1\u606f\u683c\u67b6\u5c4f\u853d\uff0c\u52a8\u91cf\u6216\u7c92\u5b50- hole\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u7aef\u6bb5\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u7c92\u5b50- hole\u5bf9\u79f0\u94fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u88ab\u4fe1\u606f\u683c\u67b6\u5c4f\u853d\uff1b\u52a8\u5dee\u70b9\u6216\u7c92\u5b50- hole\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u7aef\u6bb5\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u79d1\u6280\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this work, we study optimal bounds for partial trace quantities in terms of the spectrum; equivalently, we determine the best bounds attainable over unitary orbits of matrices. We solve this question for Schur-convex functionals acting on a single partial trace in terms of eigenvalues for self-adjoint matrices and then we extend these results to singular values of general matrices. We subsequently extend the study to Schur-convex functionals that act on several partial traces simultaneously and present sufficient conditions for sharpness. In cases where closed-form maximizers cannot be identified, we present quadratic programs that yield new computable upper bounds for any Schur-convex functional. We additionally present examples demonstrating improvements over previously known bounds. Finally, we conclude with the study of optimal bounds for an $n$-qubit system and its subsystems of dimension $2$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local \"parent\" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that if the full set of Dicke states are exact eigenstates of an extensive local Hamiltonian, then their energies must necessarily be equally spaced. Our proof builds on recent results concerning parent Hamiltonians of the $W$ state, together with general algebraic structures underlying such quasiparticle towers. We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53 AFC\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u6d3d\u7684\u201c\u6210\u5bf9\u201d\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u96c5\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u8054\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53 AFC \u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7ea0\u7f20\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790 AFC \u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4ed6\u4eec\u5fc5\u987b\u7b49\u8ddd\u6392\u5217\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u786e\u5b9e\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u8d28\u7684 AFC\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u7b49\u8ddd\u6392\u5217\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u5bf9 AFC \u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6781\u5927\u5730\u5f71\u54cd future \u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
