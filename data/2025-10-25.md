Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating
individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on
a blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$
transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a
temperature of 8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using
the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times
10^5$ atoms down to 5 uK and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$.
Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed
acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a
high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes
we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with
a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence
imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival
probability of $97(1)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a
temperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the
ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes.
These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that
combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the
essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum
information processing with Sr atoms.
