Recent localisation results in the dual 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ circular quiver gauge theories provide us with strong coupling expansions of certain correlators involving twisted half-BPS operators. To leading order, these results have been matched to an effective theory for massless twisted string states, which can be constructed by resolving the orbifold singularity and considering localised supergravity modes on the resolution cycles. Applying this reasoning to subleading order in strong coupling, we observe that for $L\\neq 2,3,4,6$, a naive reduction of the 10d $(α')^3$-correction does not result in the correct coefficients to match the localisation result. We explain this mismatch by the appearance of twisted sector resonances in string amplitudes involving external twisted sector states. We perform the low-energy expansion of a ``twisted'' Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude and recover the expected coefficients, suggesting that the orbifold resolution and the low-energy expansion can not be interchanged directly. Finally, we comment on the long-quiver limit, $L\\to\\infty$, in the context of the low-energy effective action."}

This precisely matches the formula from the surfaceology formulation of gluons, where the leading singularities are given by maximal residues, with the combinatorial problem arising from the linearized form of the $u$ variables. At loop-level we describe how the novelties associated with spin sums (related with the need for ghosts when working off-shell using Lagrangians) can be easily encoded in this combinatorial picture.

Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and Stückelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase.

Changes in leaf architecture disrupt internal light scattering dynamics and consequently affect photosynthetic performance. Previous studies on internal leaf light scattering have primarily relied on ray-tracing approaches (e.g., Raytran) or radiative-transfer models (e.g., PROSPECT). However, these high-frequency approximations cannot capture diffraction and coherent multiple scattering in wavelength-scale leaf tissues, unlike full-wave electromagnetic simulations. Here, we employ GPU-accelerated Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations to model internal light scattering dynamics using segmented cross-section image geometries of representative dicot and monocot leaves with wavelength-dependent complex refractive indices. The simulations accurately reproduce the reflectance and transmittance characteristics of healthy leaves, showing strong agreement with the PROSPECT model, with average Lin's concordance values of 0.8962 for dicot leaves and 0.7849 for monocot leaves. We further simulate early-stage necrotrophic fungal infection by modeling melanized hyphae penetrating the cuticle and upper epidermis. Diseased leaves exhibit a pronounced reduction in visible green reflectance and a marked suppression of the near-infrared reflectance plateau, consistent with experimental observations. Remaining discrepancies in the visible band are expected to be reduced through more advanced geometric and material modeling. This proof-of-concept study presents a full-wave FDTD optical modeling framework for plant-leaf light scattering, enabling physics-based analysis of internal scattering before and after early-stage fungal penetration and supporting the use of light scattering as an indicator for pre-symptomatic plant fungal disease detection."}

While BTZ black holes are stable under standard Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we demonstrate that they can develop instabilities when subjected to double-trace boundary conditions. Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper."}

Two of the spin-charge ground states, respectively consists of three-site and six-site ferromagnetic (FM) clusters arranged in anti-FM and $120^{\\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel (YK) phase which we label as S-AF (super-antiferromagnet) and S-YK (super-YK) respectively.

Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) provide a potential solution by enabling the reversible chemical binding and release of hydrogen. However, recent experimental studies have revealed a puzzling inhibition of catalytic activity during LOHC dehydrogenation, associated with the absence of hydrogen bubble formation, reduced hydrogen production rates and significant variability across experiments. In this work, we derive a model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this inhibition, taking into account both the reversible nature of the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction and the role of transport phenomena. Our results demonstrate that efficient transport of hydrogen away from the catalytic pellet is essential to suppress back-reactions and thereby maximize the performance of porous catalysts. In particular, we demonstrate that two distinct kinetic regimes - with high or strongly inhibited hydrogen production - can arise depending on whether bubble nucleation is enabled or suppressed. Beyond LOHC systems, our findings are applicable to a broader class of reversible reactions, particularly those involving volatile products that can leave the liquid reaction medium in form of bubbles."}

A surface analysis technique known as Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), in the form of a custom electrospray laboratory diagnostic and an analytical-grade system, yields a comprehensive analysis of secondary ions formed from energetic ion beam impacts with ionic liquid thin-film substrates. Results revealed nearly identical positive secondary ion species for both EMI-BF4 and EMI-Im thin films, whereas EMI-Im produced a more diverse set of negative ions consistent with the greater chemical complexity of its anion. The analytical-grade SIMS spectra revealed many relatively high mass-to-charge ratio secondary ions likely below the detection limit for the laboratory diagnostic, thus shifting the average m/z value to above the monomer mass for most spectra.

This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects.

However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such \"joint\" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity."}

In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moiré superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \\textit{i.e.}, spin moiré superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \\textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials."}

The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities."}

Physical computing avoids information loss during preprocessing by directly extracting information from physical waveforms, achieving the theoretical maximum of accessible information as determined by the DPI.

The scattering matrix zeros of the system correspond to a set of complex frequencies with exponentially rising waveforms, each of which can be virtually and perfectly absorbed. Thus, an arbitrary waveform, decomposed into these complex frequencies automatically, can be captured without any absorption.

However, beyond the classical approximation, it is well-known that quantum corrections open decay channels through which oscillons radiate rapidly. Therefore it is believed that in the real world, oscillons are too short-lived to be phenomenologically relevant. We observe that previous calculations of the radiated power assume that the oscillon is in a coherent state. We show that a squeezed coherent state, on the other hand, would emit no radiation at leading order in the coupling. This leads us to the conclusion that the instantaneous radiation calculated in the literature corresponds not to the oscillon's decay, but rather to its relaxation from a coherent state to a lower-energy, squeezed coherent state, which then radiates much more slowly. As a result, the lifetime of the quantum oscillon is enhanced by an inverse power of the coupling."}

However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively.

Using a gauge transformation, we show that scattering observables depend solely on the total twist $Θ$, independent of chirality. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework, we develop a transfer-matrix method to compute reflection and transmission coefficients for incident phonons and free particles. Our results reveal a scattering threshold at the Zeeman energy $E = \\hbarΩ_0$, separating a pure phonon regime from multi-channel scattering involving both collective and single-particle excitations above threshold. For large twist angles, competition between kinetic and Zeeman energies reduces the effective spin rotation, leading to comb-like density modulations and Fano-like resonances below threshold. The transition probability between phonon and particle channels is strongly tunable with $Θ$, enhanced for odd multiples of $π$ but suppressed for even multiples. These findings establish twist-engineered domain walls as a versatile platform for controlling quantum transport, with implications for atomtronic devices and quantum simulation."}

In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise."}

In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \\textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$.

While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order."}

It establishes a complete spatial imaging chain information transfer model with the objective of obtaining the required effective information. The paper innovatively proposes a quantifiable Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) product criterion. It demonstrates that the system information transmission ability is determined by the product of MTF and SNR, and that these parameters can compensate for each other to achieve equivalent information transfer. Validation through a high-resolution Earth observation system case shows that under consistent reconstruction mean square error conditions, increasing time delay integration stages reduces optical aperture size and significantly lowers primary mirror mass. Simulations and physical experiments further indicate that by increasing integration time, low-resolution optical systems achieve reconstructed fidelity comparable to high-resolution systems.

Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis to access its spectral structure and entanglement features. Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes. We find signatures that are directly accessible in state-of-the-art experiments and offer a robust diagnostic of spontaneous emission. Our results form the basis for a new theoretical framework to assess a variety of effects, such as quasi-normal mode emission or modifications of the horizon structure on the Hawking spectrum."}

The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy."}

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction."}

They have attracted widespread attention in the field of topological quantum computing, as they serve as non-superconducting analogs of Majorana zero modes and support non-Abelian statistics in topological insulator systems. %In the braiding process of the Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, their braiding properties are closely related to the strength of disorder. However, compared to their Majorana cousins, the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes are vulnerable to the on-site energy deviation between the modes involved in the experiment. In this work, we propose to estimate the braiding properties of Jackiw-Rebbi zero-modes through measurements of transport signatures, which are readily measurable in current experiments. We find that the fidelity of braiding operation reaches unity when the current noise is fully suppressed, while this braiding fidelity monotonously decreases with the increasing of the current noise. Based on these transport signatures, we further discuss the correspondence between Majorana and Jackiw-Rebbi zero modes, highlighting their similarity in supporting non-Abelian statistics."}

This model, which can also be thought of as a zigzag ladder, provides a quantitative description of the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetization process, and accounts for the observed dispersion of the single-triplet band and its merging into a continuum near the Brillouin zone center.

One of these ($A_u$) corresponds to a non-dichroic enantiosensitive (NoDES) contribution. This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects. NoDES spectroscopy thus provides a symmetry-protected and phase-robust route to probe molecular chirality on the ultrafast time scale. The experimental confirmation of our theory is presented in the companion paper [L. Fede et al., arXiv (2025)]."}

This study examines discrete spherical Halbach configurations assembled from permanent magnets placed at the vertices of Platonic and Archimedean solids. Analytical calculations, numerical field simulations, and experimental measurements indicate that polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry achieve the most favorable balance among field strength, homogeneity, and interior accessibility. They produce exceptionally flat fourth-order central saddle points, resulting in a usable homogeneous field volume up to a factor of 260 larger than that of traditional Halbach disk or cylindrical arrays. Several magnet assemblies composed of cubical NdFeB magnets are fabricated and their three dimensional field distributions characterized, demonstrating homogeneous regions of up to several cubic centimeters with deviations below 1%. The findings establish discrete icosahedrally symmetric magnet arrays as practical, scalable building blocks for compact, highly homogeneous magnetic field sources suited to mobile magnetic resonance, and magnetophoretic applications."}

This methodological framework, referred to as guided progressive reconstructive imaging, relies on a quantization-based description of the acquired intensity, through an elementary derivation. Established direct phase retrieval solutions, such as the Wigner distribution deconvolution approach, can then be adapted to a continuous treatment of received counts, with no need for a dense data representation. Consequently, the result is obtained in the form of a progressively improving estimate, while providing immediate user feedback thanks to a remarkable processing speed, able to surpass the acquisition bandwidth. This fast measurement is enabled by the cumulative usage of a pre-calculated library of kernel-limited guide functions, compiling count-wise contributions as a function of the triggered detector pixel. Hence, the reconstruction offers the same advantages of direct phase retrieval methods, in particular a high dose-efficiency and the absence of complex convergence dynamics, with much less stringent restrictions on the field of view than is typical in current alternatives. Its implementation is also significantly more straightforward and flexible. Overall, this work constitutes a major evolution in the state-of-the-art, facilitating repeatable and low-dose experiments with high accessibility, and being applicable to electron-based imaging, X-ray diffraction and optical microscopy."}

As an example, for a disk-shaped phase plate, with the beam acting on the edge at a radius of 10 cm, a rotation frequency of 1 kHz, and a phase-element size of 10 nm, the continuous spectral broadening reaches 0.07%. Further increasing the rotation speed or reducing the phase-element can lead to greater spectral broadening. When multiple URPPs are arranged in series, the superimposed spatiotemporal modulation further enhances the continuous spectral broadening and achieves more effective speckle smoothing. The scheme is applicable to broadening the independent spectrum of optical frequency combs as well as to the mitigation of laser-plasma instabilities in inertial fusion energy."}

Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations."}

The CASSIA sensor project (CMOS Active SenSor with Internal Amplification) focuses on the development of pixel matrices with internal charge multiplication based on monolithic CMOS sensor technologies suitable for application as charged particle tracking and timing detectors. CMOS sensors with in-pixel internal amplification would result in higher signal amplitudes having an improved signal-to-noise ratio, better time resolution and increased sensitivity, making them attractive for high-radiation environments. Their monolithic integration in small pixels reduces the input capacitance of a front-end amplifier and power dissipation making it suitable for fine-pitch low-power detectors.

Using the low-energy continuum model and incorporating spin-triplet $p_{x}+i p_{y}$ pairing in each graphene layer, we construct the effective models for both tBLG and tDBLG with superconductivity. By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems. The framework developed here may also be extended to other multilayer moiré materials, offering a route towards engineering exotic topological superconductivity with tunable parameters."}

In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\\mathrm{CDW}} \\approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \\sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($α$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase. These findings demonstrate a previously unidentified correlated phase transition in the topological CDW-Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I, enriching the phase diagram of this material and establishing it as an ideal platform for studying intertwined electronic and structural orders."}

The problem is, thus, effectively reduced to that of regression on a very large scale, made tractable by deep learning architectures and automatic differentiation frameworks.

Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology."}

So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films."}

Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively. This adjustable pulse-splitting scheme allows full advantage to be taken of light-sheet illumination for fast in vivo 2P imaging."}

Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology."}

However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup. There are three types of tensor perturbations, two of which are dynamical. We show that chiral gravitational waves can be generated in the presence of parity-violating terms in the potential."}

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."}

Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB.

The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories."}

The adaptive nature of the proposed receiver yields significant quantum advantages over classical receivers without relying on complex or fragile quantum resources such as entanglement.

In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices."}

In this context, we perform systematic calculations of the BSE for the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling at intermediate coupling. Our study illustrates how the divergence of a fundamental building block of the BSE in the charge channel, the two-particle irreducible vertex, systematically occurs at lower interactions than in the (purely local) DMFT case, due to short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Further, the change of sign of the eigenvalues of the generalized charge susceptibility associated to the vertex divergences is identified as the essential prerequisite to drive, at larger interaction values, the physics of the Mott transition in two dimensions, as well as of the adjacent phase-separation instabilities."}

Our key findings are threefold. First, we show that BTZ black holes exhibit instabilities not only for non-axisymmetric modes $\\unicode{x2013}$ previously the only known unstable sector $\\unicode{x2013}$ but crucially also for axisymmetric modes. Second, we prove that the axisymmetric instability is the dominant and most fundamental: configurations unstable to any non-axisymmetric mode are already unstable to the axisymmetric one. Third, we identify regions in the BTZ parameter space where these black holes are unstable while global AdS$_3$ remains stable, and we map the complete onset curves that determine the corresponding stability boundaries. Unlike conventional superradiant instabilities, the BTZ double-trace instability occurs for angular velocities always satisfying the Hawking-Reall bound. We trace the physical origin of these instabilities to the influx of energy and angular momentum through the asymptotic boundary permitted by double-trace deformations for a particular sign of the coupling, rather than to near-horizon effects. Our results provide a prototype for understanding double-trace instabilities in higher-dimensional rotating AdS black holes and suggest the existence of rotating hairy black hole solutions with scalar condensates, which we construct in a companion paper."}

We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes.

In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems."}

Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters."}

With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions."}

However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such \"joint\" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity."}

This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole."}

We systematically investigated the effects of phase evolution, structural modulation, and morphology on the oxidase activity of MnO$_x$ with Fe substitution. The oxidase-like activity was evaluated using the chromogenic substrate 3,3$'$,5,5$'$-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which produced a blue-colored oxidized TMB (ox-TMB) with an absorption peak at 652~nm upon oxidation. While all Fe-doped MnO$_x$ nanostructures exhibited oxidase-like activity, the 10\\% Fe-doped sample (10Fe-MnO$_x$) demonstrated the highest performance, likely due to a synergistic effect of structure, morphology, and the presence of oxygen vacancies. The underlying oxidase mechanism was investigated using steady-state kinetics and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis.

In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise."}

Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123."}

These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems."}

However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos.

Using integrated soliton microcomb (SMC) and photonic encoding chips, we realize precise massive parallel frequency generation and locking, high-visibility HOM interferences and measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution. The proposed architecture enables a 200-user fully connected quantum network over 200 kilometers with strict information-theoretic security via untrusted network provider. The implemented networking architecture paves the way for realizing large-scale fully connected MDI quantum networks across metropolitan and intercity regions."}

The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging."}

We study the degradation of quantum entanglement for field modes shared by inertial and accelerated observers in spacelike and lightlike Lorentz-violating vacua that generate identical spacetime metrics. Using the near-horizon Rindler correspondence, we derive analytic expressions for the logarithmic negativity and mutual information and examine their dependence on detector position, frequency, and Lorentz-violation parameters. Despite sharing the same metric, the two Lorentz-violating vacua become distinguishable near the horizon, particularly at low frequencies. We analyze the excitation of a freely falling two-level atom coupled to quantum fields near the horizon. The associated acceleration-radiation transition probabilities are computed explicitly. The resulting atomic response is locally indistinguishable from that in flat spacetime, confirming the validity of the equivalence principle even in the presence of Lorentz-violating corrections. Finally, we extend the notion of horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy to the bumblebee black hole and derive the corresponding entropy production rate induced by infalling atoms."}

However, in this paper, we will show that this monotonicity is not universally valid. By deriving a universal, ensemble-independent criterion for $\\mathrm{d}r_{\\rm c}/\\mathrm{d}r_h$ and applying it to the $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter black hole, we reveal a sharp dichotomy: while $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ exhibits strictly monotonicity along isobars, it typically becomes non-monotonic along isotherms (except for the photon sphere of Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter black hole)--a behavior that has been overlooked in previous studies. Nevertheless, we rigorously prove that within the phase-transition region itself, the monotonicity of $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ is preserved. However, the generalizability of this result to other spacetimes requires case-by-case verification, and its validity could have notable implications for the observability of the jump in $r_{\\rm c}$. Interestingly, non-monotonicity itself acts as a new observational probe: the monotonicity contrast in $r_{\\rm c}(r_h)$ distinguishes isobaric from isothermal evolution, providing a complementary thermodynamic probe. Furthermore, we show that the critical exponents extracted from $r_{\\rm c}$ match those obtained from $r_h$, independent of ensemble. Remarkably, all these phenomena are closely tied to the thermodynamic first law."}

In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1) /\\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group. This motivates a picture in which spacetime emerges from the area law-contribution to the entanglement entropy, while gauge and matter degrees of freedom are due to area law-violating terms. We remark on a possible natural origin of the chirality of the weak force in the given construction. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of using this construction in quantum simulations of Standard Model fields."}

Due to the presence of nonlinear effects, such as mode competition and gain saturation in digital laser systems, it is often necessary to rely on specifically manually tailored approach or iteration processes to find suitable loaded phases in Digital lasers. This study proposes a model based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) and a modified U-Net architecture, with designed loss functions to inverse design the loaded phases. In this work, we employ deep neural networks to learn the nonlinear effects in simulated L-shape digital lasers, enabling the prediction of SLM-loaded phases for both analytical and non-analytical arbitrary structured light fields. The results demonstrate superior performance on non-analytical light fields compared to the current methods in L-shape Digital lasers. Furthermore, a transfer learning strategy is introduced, allowing knowledge obtained from one class of structured beams to be effectively reused for another, thereby enhancing generalization and improving performance under limited training data. Importantly, this method, the first proposed learning framework for digital lasers, is not limited to the L-shaped digital lasers discussed in this study, providing an efficient alternative for generating structured light in other digital laser systems."}

We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. In addition, the system exhibits a new type of condensation transition that does not occur in the corresponding equilibrium scenario. As an outlook, we discuss potential applications of this cooling approach for quantum simulation schemes with interacting microwave photons."}

Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB.

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction."}

This revisited horizon entropy is constructed directly from the modified Friedmann equations in a non-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift. The analysis demonstrates that including the integral term in the revisited entropy can relatively improve the late-time validity of the GSL for some of these models while living others unchanged, thereby reinforcing the profound connection between thermodynamics and gravity."}

Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations."}

We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. In addition, the system exhibits a new type of condensation transition that does not occur in the corresponding equilibrium scenario.

Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems.

Analytical solutions of the optical Bloch equations under steady-state conditions show that the induced torque and resulting rotational motion exhibit high sensitivity to phase variations.

To this end, equations of motion for Bloch components are derived from the von Neumann equation, which are mathematically equivalent to equations of motion for a distribution of point masses from classical mechanics. Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed.

This regularity constraint yields a hierarchy: sectoral solutions ($ν= μ$, satisfying the first-order highest-weight condition) exist for any real $μ> 0$, while tesseral and zonal solutions require integer steps, appearing only when $μ$ itself is integer. Third, application to a Coulomb potential shows that the familiar integer angular momentum spectrum of hydrogen arises from the periodic identification $φ\\sim φ+ 2π$ that defines the full-sphere Hilbert space domain; modified boundary conditions yield a reorganised spectrum with non-integer effective angular momentum.

This paper proposes the concept of frequency-multiplexed millimeter-wave superconducting qubits and demonstrates a novel architecture that integrates an on-chip cryogenic nonreciprocal space-time-periodic superconducting frequency multiplier as a universal control bus for a frequency-multiplexed qubit array. The bus replaces multiple high-frequency XY drive lines with a single low-frequency input tone, which the multiplier converts into a comb of high-order harmonics, each resonantly addressing a distinct qubit. Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence. This integrated, frequency-multiplexed, and nonreciprocal control bus therefore offers a path toward unprecedented I/O simplification, noise resilience, and scalable high-coherence quantum processin"}

Here we introduce an inseparability criterion that exposes non-Gaussian entanglement that escapes covariance-based criteria by incorporating higher-order quadrature cumulants. The criterion extends Gaussian theory without requiring full state tomography and can be evaluated directly from homodyne and heterodyne data and is possible to extend to arbitrary superpositions of Fock states in two modes.

Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms."}

We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions.

We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations."}

This technique yields lower atomic temperatures of 4.0(2) $μ$K compared to red-detuned polarization gradient cooling, and consequently extends the $T_2^*$ coherence time of the hyperfine clock qubit by a factor of 1.5. The method is alignment-free and can be readily implemented on laser beams used for magneto-optical trapping, as it only requires frequency and phase modulation control. Our experimental observations are corroborated by a numerical model based on a semi-classical force approach extended to a four-level system, including two hyperfine states of the upper manifold that are 120 MHz apart."}

By considering a pair of detuned two-level emitters electronically coupled and incoherently driven to a non-equilibrium steady-state, we gain insight into how electronic quantum properties such as exciton eigenstate delocalization, coherent energy transfer and steady-state electronic coherence, are manifested in the joint probability of emission or optical second-order cross correlation. Specifically, we show that the frequency associated with oscillations present in time-resolved second-order cross correlation functions quantifies not only the time scale of coherent energy transfer but also the degree of delocalization of the exciton eigenstates. Furthermore, we show that time-resolved cross correlations directly witness steady-state electronic coherence. Our work strengthens the idea that measurements of the intensity quantum cross correlations can provide distinctive signatures of the quantum behavior of biophysical emitters."}

Khoury", "Alberto Bramati", "Maxime J. Jacquet"], "title": "Momentum correlations of the Hawking effect in a quantum fluid", "comment": "13 pages, 6 figures. Comments welcome", "summary": "The Hawking effect -- the spontaneous emission of correlated quanta from horizons -- can be observed in laboratory systems where an acoustic horizon forms when a fluid transitions from subcritical to supercritical flow. Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis to access its spectral structure and entanglement features. Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes. We find signatures that are directly accessible in state-of-the-art experiments and offer a robust diagnostic of spontaneous emission. Our results form the basis for a new theoretical framework to assess a variety of effects, such as quasi-normal mode emission or modifications of the horizon structure on the Hawking spectrum."}

Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states."}

The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging."}
