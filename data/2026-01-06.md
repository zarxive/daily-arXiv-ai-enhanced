### [1] [Tunable chiral spiral phases in a non-Hermitian Ising-Gamma spin chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01020)
*Run-Dong Huang,Wei-Lin Li,Zhi Li*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: 研究了耗散对Ising-Gamma模型的影响，观察到螺旋相区域随耗散增加逐渐扩大，挤压原有无序和反铁磁相区域。引入耗散后，系统中同时出现具有相反旋向的螺旋相，为冷原子实验中调控螺旋旋向提供了途径。揭示了不同Γ项比值对相变机制的影响，相关参数和耗散均可在可检测范围内调节。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 想了解量子相变和耗散效应在复杂量子系统中的表现，特别是在Ising-Gamma模型中，螺旋相和磁性相的相互作用及调控。

Method: 通过理论分析和数值模拟，考察了不同耗散强度下的相图变化，检查了相关临界指数和有限尺寸标度行为。

Result: 发现了随耗散增加螺旋相区域的扩张Anti-ferromagnetic phase逐渐被挤压的现象。系统中同时出现了具有相反旋向的螺旋相。耗散介导了不同螺旋相之间的相变，这种相变取决于Γ项的比例。定性地，在不同Γ项Ratio下，可以调控螺旋相的相对性。

Conclusion: 该研究系统地探索了耗散对Ising-Gamma模型的影响，展望了这些特性的潜在应用，尤其是利用冷原子实验精确调节和观察这些量子相变现象。

Abstract: We study the influence of dissipation on the Ising-Gamma model. Through observables such as ground-state energy, order parameters, entanglement entropy, etc., we identify each phase region and provide the global phase diagram of the system. The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.

### [2] [Ground State and Collective Modes of Bose-Einstein Condensates in Newtonian and MOND-inspired gravitational potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01039)
*Ning Liu*

Result: 对数势下 condensate 基态尺寸随β增加呈β^{1/3}的尺度关系，MOND势下集体模频率较低，具体数值非线性缩放

Conclusion: 为 MOND 模型的实验探究提供了理论支持和数值模拟的方法

Abstract: We analytically and numerically study the ground state and collective dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in two traps: a Newtonian potential and a logarithmic potential inspired by Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). In the ground state, the MOND potential supports bound states only in the deep-MOND regime, where the condensate becomes significantly larger than its Newtonian counterpart. The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $β$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $β^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode. The larger MOND-bound condensate oscillates at a lower frequency, which scales as $β^{-1/3}$ in the strong-interaction limit. These scaling laws provide insights for quantum-simulation experiments aiming to probe modified-gravity scenarios with cold atoms.

### [3] [Accelerating evaporative cooling of a strongly interacting Fermi gas by tilting the optical trap with a magnetic field gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01732)
*Bolong Jiao,Shuai Peng,Qinxuan Peng,Shaokun Liu,Mengde Gan,Jiaming Li,Le Luo*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: A new rapid cooling method is developed for a strongly interacting $^6$Li Fermi gas in an optical dipole trap. The method uses a magnetic-field gradient to tilt the trapping potential. In the unitarity-limited regime, the cooling process self-amplifies, but this effect diminishes when the temperature approaches $T/T_F 	imes 0.5$. By introducing the magnetic gradient when the gas cools to half of its Fermi temperature, the method enhances the cooling speed and allows for efficient cooling down to $T/T_F = 0.16$ in about 25 ms, facilitating studies of superfluid behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the cooling process of ultra-cold quantum gases, particularly strongly interacting Fermi gases like $^6$Li, is crucial for advancing research in ultracold matter physics and quantum phase transitions.

Method: The cooling scheme involves using an optical dipole trap with a magnetic-field gradient-induced tilt. The method targets the unitarity-limited scattering cross section, where runaway cooling is theoretically possible but becomes less effective as the temperature approaches a certain threshold.

Result: The modified cooling method, which introduces the magnetic gradient when the gas reaches approximately $T/T_F 	imes 0.5$, significantly improves the cooling efficiency. This allows the gas to cool rapidly below the superfluid transition temperature, achieving $T/T_F = 0.16$ in about 25 ms.

Conclusion: This method offers a robust and straightforward approach to rapidly cool strongly interacting Fermi gases, enabling in-depth studies of their behavior in the superfluid regime.)

Abstract: We present a rapid evaporative cooling scheme for a strongly interacting $^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ Fermi gas in an optical dipole trap. The method uses a magnetic-field-gradient--induced tilt of the trapping potential to accelerate cooling in the unitarity-limited regime. In evaporation based only on lowering the optical trap depth, the unitarity-limited scattering cross section can support runaway cooling; however, the cooling rate slows around $T/T_F \simeq 0.5$, and the runaway behavior is no longer maintained. We improve on this approach by applying a magnetic-field gradient when the gas temperature reaches about half the Fermi temperature. The induced tilt opens an escape channel for energetic atoms while keeping the trap frequencies nearly unchanged. This modification increases the cooling speed and cools the gas below the superfluid transition temperature, reaching $T/T_F = 0.16$ on a timescale of $\sim 25\,\mathrm{ms}$. Our results provide a simple and robust route for rapidly cooling a strongly interacting Fermi gas into the superfluid regime, facilitating studies of the physics of unitary Fermi superfluids.

Abstract: The experimental advances in realizing artificial spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and non-Hermitian potentials in ultracold atomic system open a new avenue for exploring their significant roles in quantum many-body physics. Here, we investigate a non-Hermitian, two-component Fermi system in a cubic lattice with Rashba SOC and complex-valued interaction arising from two-body loss. We adopt the non-Hermitian mean field theory and map out the phase diagram at zero temperature. The interplay of dissipation and on-site interaction drives a dissipation-induced phase transition from superfluid (SF) to normal phase (N). Notably, for weak interaction strengths, this leads to a reentrance of the superfluid state. The presence of SOC significantly expands the parameter regime for both the normal phase and the metastable superfluid phase(MSF). Whereas, the Zeeman field can drive the system from a conventional superfluid into a topological superfluid phase(TSF), characterized by a nontrivial topological invariant. These results enrich our knowledge of pairing superfluidity in Fermi systems.

### [5] [Pair distribution functions of a superfluid spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact interactions in the linearized time-dependent BCS theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01985)
*Yvan Castin*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The minimal mean-field theory for pair distribution functions in a spin-1/2 superfluid Fermi gas should be the linearized time-dependent BCS theory, not the ordinary static BCS theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper compares the ordinary static BCS theory and the linearized time-dependent BCS theory for pair distribution functions in a spin-1/2 superfluid Fermi gas. While the ordinary static BCS theory is simpler, it ignores important aspects like acoustic excitations and quantum fluctuations. The paper also mentions its relevance to recent theoretical work and cold atomic experiments.

Method: The paper presents a systematic comparison between static and dynamic BCS theories regarding pair distribution functions in a spin-1/2 superfluid. It specifically highlights the differences in predictions, such as the effect of collective excitations on the system's equation of state.

Result: The paper demonstrates that the linearized time-dependent BCS theory is more accurate in capturing the behavior of pair distribution functions, especially at zero temperature, and in predicting the specific functional forms in 3D and 2D.

Conclusion: Using more precise theories can clarify unanswered questions about the properties of superfluid fermionic gases and their experimental verification in cold atomic systems.

Abstract: We show that the minimal mean-field theory to use for calculating the pair distribution functions $g_{σσ'}(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')$ of a spatially homogeneous, unpolarized spin-1/2 superfluid Fermi gas is not the ordinary static BCS theory, but the linearized time-dependent BCS theory implemented via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Indeed, the former completely ignores the acoustic excitation branch - the phonons - of the superfluid, while the latter explicitly takes it into account, as well as the quantum fluctuations induced by the broken-pair continuum. Unlike the first, the second theory (i) reflects the effect of these collective excitations on the system's equation of state, including at zero temperature, (ii) allows the function $g_{\uparrow\downarrow}(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')$ to go at sufficiently large distances strictly below its asymptotic value $(ρ/2)^2$ where $ρ$ is the gas density, as expected according to the quantum hydrodynamics of Landau and Khalatnikov at low temperatures, and (iii) predicts in the function $g_{\uparrow\uparrow}(\vec{r},\vec{r}\,')$ at short distances subdominant contributions $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|^2\ln|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|$ in 3D and $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|^2\ln(-\ln|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|)$ in 2D, alongside the dominant contributions $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|$ in 3D and $|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|^2\ln|\vec{r}-\vec{r}\,'|$ in 2D already present in static BCS theory but with a lower coefficient. This discussion is relevant to the recent theoretical work of Obeso-Jureidini and Romero-Rochin, and to the ongoing experiments on cold atomic gases at ENS and MIT.

Abstract: We offer a quantum chemical analysis of mono-halogenated borane molecules using DFT and TD-DFT theories, applying the PBE0/def2-SVPD and B3LYP/6-311+G(d) methods as implemented in ORCA, and explore how solvent effects influence electronic transition properties. The comparable benchmarks are the archetype anti-\ce{B18H22} denoted as (1) against hypothetical halogenated derivatives: 7-F-anti-\ce{B18H21} (2), 4-F-anti-\ce{B18H21} (3), and the recently synthesized 4-Br-anti-\ce{B18H21} (4). The analysis includes an optimization of the ground and first singlet excited states, vibrational frequency analysis, and a comprehensive spectroscopic profile covering IR, Raman, UV-Vis absorption, and emission spectra.
  The IR spectra of the fluorinated compounds feature a characteristic B-F stretching peak, while the Raman spectra closely resemble the parent molecule. UV-Vis spectral analysis shows a redshift and oscillator strength enhancement for F at position B7, indicating altered electronic properties due to substitution with lighter halogen. Furthermore, solvent effects enhance the probability of electronic transitions. Halogene presence led to a decrease of the energy gap EG(LUMO-HOMO) due to the stabilization of LUMO, which implied a redshift in the emission/absorption wavelength spectra, with the largest EG change at around 14\% occurring for the (4)$^{th}$ benchmark compound.. Notably, all compounds emit light within the visible spectrum, underscoring their potential for optoelectronic applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A quantitative phase analysis of substrate-free single-component and binary clusters of the Ar-Kr system obtained by adiabatic expansion of gas into vacuum through a supersonic nozzle was performed. The studies were carried out in-situ using transmission electron diffraction technique (THEED) on clusters with an average size ranging from 2000 to 100000 atoms/cluster and across the entire range of component concentrations. The independence of the threshold size of clusters, corresponding to the beginning of the formation of the hcp phase, from the component composition was revealed. It was established that clusters larger than this threshold size have a two-phase fcc-hcp structure with an identical concentration of components in each phase. The fraction of the hexagonal phase increases with the size of the aggregations and depends on the component content, reaching maximum in clusters with an equimolar composition. Arguments are presented in favor of the formation of two-phase clusters in the supersonic jet, rather than separate single-phase fcc and hcp ones. These findings are in good agreement with the previously proposed thermally activated diffusion mechanism for the nucleation and growth of the hcp phase in rare gas clusters.

Abstract: The article discusses an original spectroscopic method for the study of supersonic argon jets in atomic and cluster flow regimes. The method is based on absolute measurements of the VUV radiation flux from a supersonic argon jet induced by a 1 keV electron beam. The integral radiation flux and spectral distribution of the radiation flux density of a supersonic argon jet in the range of 50-150 nanometers were measured, which made it possible to determine the density of the non-condensed atomic component, the fraction of condensate, and the density of clusters in a supersonic argon jet at given parameters of its flow into vacuum. The obtained parameters also allowed us to estimate the emission cross sections for the argon resonance lines ArI (λ=104.8 nm, λ=106.7 nm) and the cluster continuum λ=127 nm.

Abstract: This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the electronic and excited-state properties of syn- and anti-isomers of the borane cluster B18H22 and their sulfur-doped derivatives.
  Using the PB86/def2-SVP level of theory with dispersion corrections, the research examines how sulfur substitution and non-covalent interactions influence cluster stability, electronic structure, spectra, and optoelectronic potential. Comparative analysis of the syn- and anti-isomers reveals the impact of molecular conformation on frontier molecular orbitals and related energetic and photophysical properties. Sulfur doping is shown to enhance charge delocalization, stabilize excited states, and improve thermal stability, which form key factors for tunable laser applications.
  The inclusion of advanced dispersion correction methods proves essential for accurately capturing many-body interactions that govern electronic behavior. By elucidating the interplay between structural features, substitution patterns, and computational modeling, the work provides valuable insights into structure-property relationships critical for designing borane-based materials with tailored optoelectronic and thermal characteristics. In addition to doping and dispersion effects, functionals' effects were examined through comparison amidst various ones with different asymptotic exchange on excitation and gap energies. In summary, the computational methodology combined good DFT/Basis/dispersion set to accurately predict geometries, IR/UV spectra, NMR chemical shifts, dipole moments, polarizability and excited-state properties, thereby offering a comprehensive theoretical understanding of syn-, anti- isomers of B18H22 and its sulfur doped variants.

*X. Huet,A. Aerts,N. Vaeck,M. Génévriez,X. Urbain*

TL;DR: This paper presents detailed rovibronic spectra of the CO$^{2+}$ doubly-charged molecular ion, resolving its spin-orbit splittings and expanding our knowledge of this benchmark molecule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of rovibronic spectra for CO$^{2+}$ molecules is essential for understanding their vibrational-rotational energy levels and transitions, which is fundamental in precision metrology and tests of fundamental constants.

Method: High-resolution Coulomb explosion measurements were performed on rapidly moving CO$^{2+}$ molecules, and ab initio calculations were utilized to interpret the spectral features.

Result: The research successfully resolved the spin-orbit splittings of the X $^3Π_Ω(v=0)$ ground state but failed to discern rotational structures due to spectral congestion. It offers unprecedented spectroscopic data on CO$^{2+}$ with high resolution.

Conclusion: These findings expand our understanding of the CO$^{2+}$ doubly-charged ion and contribute to the short list of molecules studied at such high resolution.

Abstract: We report rovibronic spectra of the A $^3Σ^+$($v'=0-2$) - X $^3Π_Ω(v=0)$ rovibronic transitions ($|Ω|=0, 1$ and 2) of the CO$^{2+}$ doubly-charged molecular ion. Spectra were recorded at high resolution ($\sim 5$~cm$^{-1}$) in a fast beam of CO$^{2+}$ molecules by detecting the Coulomb explosion of the molecules upon excitation to the A state. Measurements were guided by \textit{ab initio} calculations which then assisted the assignment of the observed spectral features. Our results resolve the spin-orbit splittings of the ground vibronic state X $^3Π_Ω(v=0)$, but not the rotational structure of the bands due to spectral congestion, and provide spectroscopic information on CO$^{2+}$ with unprecedented resolution. In doing so they expand our knowledge of this benchmark doubly charged molecular ion and expand the short list of doubly charged molecules studied at high resolution.

Motivation: Investigating optical properties of a three-level atomic system under a magnetic field has applications in magnetic sensing, metrology, and photonic devices.

Method: Used Bloch equations under different regimes (stationary, quasi-stationary, short-pulse) to derive atomic populations and coherences, identified a bifurcation in oscillatory dynamics.

Result: Found frequency-dependent sign reversals in Fourier analysis, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillations suitable for weak magnetic sensing; fast oscillations for optical applications.

Conclusion: Framework provides a basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.

Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.

### [12] [Resolution of the hyperfine puzzle and its significance for two fermion Dirac atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02300)
*Gordon Baym,Glennys Farrar*

Main category: physics.atom-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines the hyperfine interaction in hydrogen and positronium using a relativistic variational approach based on the Dirac equation, concluding that the system remains stable despite quantum corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability of hydrogen-like atoms and their isoelectronic ions in the relativistic regime is a fundamental question in quantum mechanics.

Method: Exact solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom is used, along with variational methods to account for relativistic effects and optimize the system's energy state.

Result: The hyperfine interaction is shown to be softened at small radii, and stability is ensured by balancing the hyperfine interaction with the kinetic energy.

Conclusion: The system's structure and stability are consistent with relativistic quantum mechanics, particularly when accounting for the suppression of the electron and proton magnetic moments at small radii.

Abstract: The hyperfine interaction in the ground state of a hydrogen atom of assumed radius $R$ is proportional to $-1/R^3$, raising the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen, or positronium. We approach the problem in terms of a minimax variational calculation based on the exact Gordon solution of the Dirac equation for the hydrogen atom ground state. The full Dirac treatment leads to the result that in an assumed variational state of size $R$, when $R$ minimizes the total energy the magnetic moment of the electron assumes its usual value, $e\hbar/2mc$, but when $R<\hbar/mc$, the effective electron magnetic moment becomes essentially $eR/2$, softening the hyperfine interaction and eliminating an energy minumum at small $R$. The magnetic moment of the proton is similarly suppressed, and the hyperfine interaction of a small size atom becomes bounded by the kinetic energy, thus assuring stability. We extend the Dirac variational calculation to positronium where we find simple results for the ground state energy and hyperfiine interaction, and then extend this variational calculation to Coulombic atoms of two fermions of arbitrary masses. This paper also lays out a framework for treating diquarks as relativistic Coulombic systems, in the presence of color electric and magnetic interactions.

*Taichi Miyagawa,Junki Tanaka*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: A precise reconstruction of momentum and scattering angles is essential for studying preformed α clusters via the (p,pα) reaction. This paper presents an ion-optical analysis using the Grand Raiden spectrometer, employing an under-focus setup to maintain sensitivity to vertical scattering angles while achieving high momentum resolution. Momentum calibration was performed using elastic scattering of 206Pb(p,p), and scattering angles were reconstructed using ion-optical relations, with higher-order effects corrected by multidimensional fitting. The dominant contributions were up to third order within experimental acceptance. The framework enables consistent event-by-event reconstruction, facilitating reliable quasi-free (p,pα) analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The (p,pα) reaction is a key tool for studying preformed α clusters in nuclei, making accurate reconstruction of reaction kinematics essential for understanding these cluster formations and their role in nuclear structure and reactions.

Method: The paper presents an ion-optical analysis using the Grand Raiden spectrometer. An under-focus optical setup preserves sensitivity to vertical scattering angles while maintaining high momentum resolution. The focal-plane geometry was independently determined using a purely geometrical reference. Momentum calibration was performed using elastic scattering of 206Pb(p,p) at a fixed spectrometer angle. Scattering angles were reconstructed using ion-optical relations, and residual higher-order effects were corrected by multidimensional fitting. The dominant contributions to the reconstruction were found to arise from terms up to third order within the experimental acceptance.

Result: The ion-optical framework developed in the paper enables precise, event-by-event reconstruction of reaction kinematics for the (p,pα) reaction. This method provides a reliable basis for analyzing preformed α clusters in nuclei, with the dominant reconstruction contributions arising from third-order effects within the experimental acceptance. The setup, including under-focus calibration and multidimensional analysis, ensures high sensitivity and accuracy in measuring both momentum and scattering angles.

Conclusion: The ion-optical analysis with the Grand Raiden spectrometer presented in this paper significantly enhances the precision and reliability of studying preformed α clusters via the (p,pα) reaction. By focusing on both momentum and scattering angle reconstruction and employing advanced calibration and correction methods, this framework offers a robust tool for future research in nuclear structure and reaction mechanisms involving α clusters.

Abstract: The quasi-free $(p,pα)$ reaction is a powerful tool to probe preformed $α$ clusters in nuclei, but it requires accurate reconstruction of both momentum and scattering angles at the reaction point. In this work, ion-optical analysis for $(p,pα)$ measurements with the Grand Raiden spectrometer is presented. An under-focus optical setting was adopted to preserve sensitivity to the vertical scattering angle while maintaining high momentum resolution. The focal-plane geometry was determined independently as a purely geometrical reference. Momentum calibration was performed using elastic scattering of $^{206}$Pb$(p,p)$ at a fixed spectrometer angle. Scattering angles were reconstructed using ion-optical relations, and residual higher-order effects were corrected by a multidimensional fit. The dominant contributions to the reconstruction were found to arise from terms up to third order within the experimental acceptance. This ion-optical framework enables consistent event-by-event reconstruction of the reaction kinematics and provides a reliable basis for quasi-free $(p,pα)$ analyses.

Abstract: Unravelling the complex processes governing battery degradation is critical to the energy transition, yet the efficacy of operando characterisation is severely constrained by a lack of Reliability, Representativeness, and Reproducibility (the 3Rs). Current methods rely on bespoke hardware and passive, pre-programmed methodologies that are ill-equipped to capture stochastic failure events. Here, using the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's multi-modal toolkit as a case study, we expose the systemic inability of conventional experiments to capture transient phenomena like dendrite initiation. To address this, we propose Heuristic Operando experiments: a framework where an AI pilot leverages physics-based digital twins to actively steer the beamline to predict and deterministically capture these rare events. Distinct from uncertainty-driven active learning, this proactive search anticipates failure precursors, redefining experimental efficiency via an entropy-based metric that prioritises scientific insight per photon, neutron, or muon. By focusing measurements only on mechanistically decisive moments, this framework simultaneously mitigates beam damage and drastically reduces data redundancy. When integrated with FAIR data principles, this approach serves as a blueprint for the trusted autonomous battery laboratories of the future.

Abstract: We present a statistical method for detecting and analysing state changes in experimental measurements using the Cuscore statistic and its special case, the Centred Cuscore statistic. These statistics are designed to identify deviations in detector responses using sequential hypothesis testing relative to a defined reference state. Applications to charge-changing reaction experiments at the FRagment Separator facility at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, Germany, and the Second Radioactive Ion Beam Line in Lanzhou at the Institute of Modern Physics, China, demonstrate the ability of these tools to quantify state changes, identify the change point, and classify data segments based on measured states. For long-term online monitoring, we use the exponentially weighted moving average to continuously update computations, enabling the detection of successive changes. This method supports both real-time and post-experiment diagnostics and provides a robust approach for enhancing data integrity and experimental control in nuclear physics and related fields.

Abstract: High-purity germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detectors are core instruments in nuclear physics and astrophysics experiments, where long-term stability and reliable extraction of decay parameters are essential. However, the standard exponential decay analyses of the detector time-series data are often affected by the strong correlations between the fitted parameters and the sensitivity to detector-related fluctuations and outliers. In this study, we present a robust analysis framework for HPGe detector decay data based on pairwise ratios and the Steiner's most frequent value (MFV) statistic. By forming point-to-point ratios of background-subtracted net counts, the dependence on the absolute detector response is eliminated, removing the amplitude-lifetime correlation inherent to conventional regression. The resulting pairwise lifetime estimates exhibit heavy-tailed behavior, which is efficiently summarized using the MFV, a robust estimator designed for such distributions. For the case study, a long and stable dataset from an HPGe detector was used. This data was gathered during a low-temperature nuclear physics experiment focused on observing the 216 keV gamma-ray line in 97-Ru. Using measurements spanning approximately 10 half-lives, we obtain a mean lifetime of tau = 4.0959 +/- 0.0007 (stat) +/- 0.0110 (syst) d, corresponding to a half-life of T1/2 = 2.8391 +/- 0.0005 (stat) +/- 0.0076 (syst) d. These results demonstrate that the pairwise-MFV approach provides a robust and reproducible tool for analyzing long-duration HPGe detector data in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics experiments, particularly for precision decay measurements, detector-stability studies, and low-background monitoring.

Conclusion: This advancement in argon-based neutron capture experiments paves the way for more efficient characterization of neutron interactions, beneficial for neutrino physics and dark matter research.

Abstract: The n_TOF collaboration has expressed interest in developing transmission experiments with liquid argon (LAr) and gaseous argon (GAr) to improve the understanding of neutron propagation and capture in Ar. This topic is relevant to both nuclear and particle physics, as LAr is widely used in neutrino experiments, dark matter searches and other applications. Despite its widespread use, neutron interactions on Ar are still poorly characterized. In this context, the Multiple Argon Experiments (MArEX) initiative aims to address these gaps by providing detailed measurements of neutron and Ar interactions, including resolved resonance parameters and radiative capture widths, across an unprecedented energy range from 1 eV to 200 MeV. As part of MArEX research activities, this paper presents the development of an innovative High-Pressure Reinforced Vessel (HPRV) for GAr targets, produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) and reinforced with carbon fibre (CF). The experimental results confirmed the capability of the vessel to withstand high operating pressure without any issues and the capability of the Multi-layers Finite Element Model (MLs-FEM) to simulate and predict the stress behaviour and the operation limit of the vessel.

Result: The developed model is tuned specifically for the CYGNO Optical TPC case, and its performance is validated using experimental data from the LIME prototype. The results indicate that the simulation accurately predicts the detector's response.

Conclusion: The comprehensive modeling approach successfully addresses the challenges in simulating the complex detector response. The method is validated, and the detector's potential for dark matter studies is confirmed.

Abstract: Gaseous Time Projection Chambers with Optical Readout are sensitive detectors suitable for 3D measurement of low-energy O(1 keV) particles and are proposed for detecting rare events such as Dark Matter particle interactions. The CYGNO collaboration is developing such a detector with a high spatial and energy resolution, leveraging an innovative optical readout system. A reliable simulation of the detector response is needed to properly assess the physics reach of this technique and to better understand the performance of the detector in the development phase. Such a simulation cannot entirely rely on existing software packages; indeed, none of the available tools is capable of properly and reliably treating the different phenomena occurring in the detector, from the primary interaction in the gas volume throughout the whole detector response model, including charge transport, light production and propagation, and the response of the optical sensors. In this paper, we present a modeling of the detector response tuned on the CYGNO Optical TPC case; a description of the method is reported together with comparisons with experimental data from the LIME prototype to demonstrate the simulation performances.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A method is presented for inferring the deuterium fuel ion temperature from neutron counts measured with fast liquid scintillators in conditions where the ion velocity distribution is Maxwellian. Local neutron count rates at each scintillator position are combined to estimate total neutron yield from the plasma, where absolute detection efficiency is determined via MCNP neutron scattering simulation based on a 3D model of the experiment structure. This method is particularly advantageous for Magnetized Target Fusion applications as it yields a time-resolved diagnostic and does not require direct line-of-sight to the plasma or collimation of the neutrons. The instrumentation configuration, pulse-shape discrimination and pile-up correction algorithms, detector calibration, and ion temperature calculation method with uncertainty characterization are discussed. An application of the method to General Fusion's Plasma Injector~3 (PI3) spherical tokamak device is demonstrated and the results are compared to an Ion Doppler spectroscopy ion temperature diagnostic.

Abstract: In accelerator-based experiments, detector arrays constructed from organic plastic scintillators are widely used for measurements of particle timing, hit position, and energy loss. These detectors are often operated in proximity to magnetic spectrometers, where the associated photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are exposed to fringe magnetic fields. The standard approach to mitigate magnetic interference involves individually shielding each PMT. In this work, we present a combined passive shielding solution consisting of a common iron enclosure for a row of PMTs, supplemented with individual mu-metal cylinders. This configuration was deployed during a 2022 experiment at JINR. Performance evaluations show that the proposed shielding effectively preserves PMT gain and timing resolution, demonstrating its viability for future applications in similar experimental environments.

Abstract: Interferometry techniques are essential for extracting phase information from optical systems, enabling precise measurements of dispersion and highly sensitive detection of perturbations. While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level. The proposed interferometry technique offers a reliable, compact, and stable solution for broadband phase measurements and single-cell dispersion imaging for applications in metrology, molecular diagnostics, drug discovery, and quantum sensing.

Abstract: We demonstrated crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (c-SOS) metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian beam into arrays of complex optical traps, including arrays of optical bottle beams that trap atoms in dark regions interleaved with bright tweezer arrays. The high refractive index and indirect band gap of crystalline silicon makes it possible to design high-resolution near-infrared ($λ>700$ nm) metasurfaces that can be manufactured at scale using CMOS-compatible processes. Compared with active components like spatial light modulators (SLMs) that have become widely used to generate trap arrays, metasurfaces provide an indefinitely scalable number of pixels, enabling large arrays of complex traps in a very small form factor, as well as reduced dynamic noise. To design metasurfaces that can generate three-dimensional bottle beams to serve as dark traps, we modified the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to enforce complex-amplitude profiles at the focal plane of the metasurface and to optimize the uniformity of the traps across the array. We fabricated and measured c-SOS metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian laser beam into arrays of bright traps, dark traps, and interleaved bright/dark traps.

Abstract: Optical chaos holds great promise for secure communication, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning. However, its scalability has long been constrained by an intrinsic trade-off between bandwidth and the number of parallel chaotic channels. Here, we introduce a programmable "chaos-on-comb" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness. Furthermore, we employ the uncorrelated parallel chaos for ultrafast photonic decision-making in a 256-armed bandit problem, achieving a favourable power-law scaling exponent of 0.86. Our work paves the way toward programmable, reconfigurable, and application-ready photonic chaos systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence, an emerging, powerful and efficient computational tool, has played a crucial role in the design of optical devices. For the design of holographic metasurfaces, traditional algorithms require multiple iterations between the metasurface and target planes, resulting in excessive computation time. Here, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for the fast design of terahertz three-dimensional (3D) holographic metasurfaces. Trained in a self-supervised manner, the PINN eliminates the need for paired input-label datasets. After training, the PINN enables end-to-end mapping between the target holographic patterns and metasurface structures. Both simulation and experimental results of single-plane and 3D multi-plane holography demonstrate that metasurfaces designed by PINN offer higher imaging quality than traditional iterative algorithms. Moreover, the PINN can find approximate solutions of metasurface structures even in physically counterintuitive scenarios, where the holographic patterns of two parallel imaging planes are completely distinct. Furthermore, the inference process of PINN typically takes less than 1 second, much faster than the traditional algorithms requiring iterative computation. Notably, the PINN simultaneously accounts for both phase and amplitude modulation, thereby outperforming traditional phase-only modulation algorithms in handling complex physical scenarios and offering superior imaging quality. This end-to-end design approach has the potential to pave the way for the realization of high-quality, real-time, and large-scale terahertz 3D holographic display technology.

The QOCC harnesses high parallelism of light by wavelength-division multiplexing, processing high-dimensional data simultaneously through multiple optical wavelength channels. Compared to the electronic computing counterpart, our QOCC achieves higher computational fidelity (root mean square error < 0.035) and substantially reduced computational load (2/3 lower).

Result: Experiments confirm the feasibility of calculus operations on EM waves, with potential applications in various fields.

Conclusion: STCM offers a promising approach for advanced EM wave manipulations with programmability and real-time adaptability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of metasurfaces and the increasing demand for programmable metasurfaces to simplify information systems, wave-based computation using metasurfaces has emerged as an attractive research topic. To facilitate the mathematical operations in electromagnetic (EM) space, here we propose a space-time coding metasurface (STCM) system capable of directly performing calculus operations on the spatial energy distributions of EM waves. By exploiting harmonic characteristics induced by time-varying coding, the responses of meta-atoms at specific harmonics can be flexibly controlled, which enables the metasurface system to address more complex tasks. Owing to its programmability, the STCM can dynamically switch functions in real time to accommodate different calculus tasks. To fully leverage the capability of STCM, we not only present the space-time coding sequences for differentiation and integration of EM waves, but also develop and numerically simulate the space-time coding sequences that can independently and simultaneously implement different calculus operations on the same incident EM waves. To experimentally validate the feasibility of the EM calculus operations, proof-of-concept experiments are conducted using a programmable 2-bit STCM. Good agreements among the theory, numerical simulations, and experiments confirm the feasibility of performing calculus operations in the EM space and demonstrate the broad application prospects of STCM in EM wave manipulations, wireless communications, and signal processing.

Abstract: We report on the modal analysis of open gyrotropic waveguides (GWs). The GWs consist of a non-circular gyrotropic (i.e., gyroelectric and gyromagnetic) core and an infinitely extending isotropic cladding. To solve this problem, we develop two independent full-wave methods. The first technique is an extended integral equation (EIE) method, an extension of a previously developed EIE used to calculate the propagation constants in composite dielectric-isotropic waveguides. The second technique is a Chebyshev expansion method (CEM). In both implementations, the electric and magnetic fields in the gyrotropic core are expanded in superpotential-based cylindrical vector wave functions (SUPER-CVWFs), recently developed for the problem of oblique multiple scattering by gyrotropic cylinders. Both techniques allow us to calculate the propagation constants in the general case, without approximations. Various non-circular gyrotropic waveguides are considered. The EIE and CEM results are validated against a commercial finite element solver, and the accuracy and computational performance of both methods are benchmarked. A microwave application is presented where the complex propagation constants of ferrite rods are computed in the presence of an external magnetic flux density bias. Our work advances the theory of propagation in open waveguides, from dielectric/isotropic to gyrotropic ones, and enables the design of contemporary waveguiding structures.

Abstract: Optical cavities with moving mirrors provide a versatile platform for exploring radiation-matter interactions and optically mediated mechanical effects, whose control has wide technological implications. However, capturing the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic field and of the mirror within a consistent theoretical framework remains challenging. We analyze the problem of the coupling between classical electromagnetic fields in a cavity and a movable mirror, considering both nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes of motion. Starting from the equations of motion for a mirror subject to a generic external potential, we provide a variational formulation of the mirror-radiation interaction. Within this framework, a single-mode variational approximation is introduced, which captures the essential dynamical features of the coupled system. In the special case of a mirror undergoing free motion, the variational method yields an exact solution. This unified treatment highlights the connection between different dynamical regimes and provides a basis for analyzing applications ranging from precision interferometry to relativistic radiation-pressure effects.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统 photoacoustic 器件的局限，推动了深部组织成像技术的发展。

Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography leverages ultrasound's deep tissue penetration to retrieve optical absorption contrast well beyond the optical diffusion limit. Conventional photoacoustic systems rely on externally delivered light and are therefore constrained by optical attenuation, limiting imaging depths to several centimeters. Here, we overcome this constraint using a compact, acoustically powered device that provides optical excitation directly from within the target medium. By exploiting the weak attenuation of low-MHz ultrasound, acoustic energy is transmitted through tissue to wirelessly power a pulsed laser diode. The emitted light pulses generate photoacoustic signals that encode local optical absorption at clinically relevant depths, which could enable imaging in regions such as the gastrointestinal tract that are inaccessible to surface-based illumination. We demonstrate this approach by imaging through a 12 cm thick phantom, establishing a pathway toward deep-tissue photoacoustic imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing size of deep neural networks (DNNs) leads to high power consumption, a barrier to sustainability. Quantum emitters, known for their strong nonlinearity, introduce a new approach to overcome this limitation in optical neural networks.

Method: We developed an all-optical deep learning architecture using quantum emitters embedded in inverse-designed nanophotonic structures. The system leverages quantum emitters' saturable nonlinearity to enhance neural network capabilities.

Result: Our system successfully performs complex tasks like nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning. Quantum activation operates at extremely low power (below nW/μm²) and enables large-scale neural networks to run efficiently at watt levels, significantly reducing the power budget required.

Conclusion: By integrating quantum mechanics with optical neural networks, this approach paves the way for sustainable AI inference with minimal power consumption, addressing scalability challenges in DNNs.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of deep neural networks comes at the cost of unsustainable power consumption. While optical neural networks offer an alternative, their capabilities remain constrained by the lack of efficient optical nonlinearities. To address this, we propose an all-optical deep learning architecture by embedding quantum emitters in inverse-designed nanophotonic structures. Due to their saturability, quantum emitters exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinearity compared with conventional materials. Using physics-aware training, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture can solve complex tasks, including nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning, which have not been realized in all-optical neural networks. To enable fair comparison across different platforms, we introduce a framework that quantitatively links nonlinearity to a network's expressive power. Analysis shows that our quantum activation, operating below nW/μm^2 intensity, reduces the power budget by seven orders of magnitude. System-level estimates show that the optical power required for large language models scales sublinearly with model size, enabling watt-level operation. Our results indicate that quantum nanophotonics provides a route toward sustainable AI inference.

Motivation: Understanding and controlling optical forces in fluid environments is crucial for advancing fields like biophotonics and microfluidics 

Method: Used Janus particles (dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold) and induced scattering asymmetry from linear polarization beam adjustment to control lateral optical forces in water.

Result: Observed reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles merely by rotating the beam polarization, aligning with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: Presents a novel method for optical manipulation using polarization, opening new possibilities in programmable systems.

Abstract: Optical forces - studied since the earliest days of laser physics - continue to reveal rich dynamics and enable powerful tools for manipulation of objects on micro- and nanoscales, and even individual atoms. Lateral optical forces, which act perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation, are particularly intriguing but have largely been restricted to interface geometries such as air - water boundaries. Here, we realize tunable lateral optical force entirely within a fluid environment by using Janus particles: dielectric microspheres half-coated with gold. We show that the lateral optical force arises from scattering asymmetry induced by the asymmetric structure of the particles; it can be tuned by adjusting the polarization angle of a linearly polarized beam, but also particle parameters including their size and orientation. Experimentally, we directly observe fully reversible lateral propulsion of Janus particles in water merely by rotating the polarization direction, in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results establish a new mechanism for programmable, polarization-controlled optical manipulation, with promising implications for biophotonics, microfluidics, and active soft-matter systems.

Motivation: the abstract discusses a novel method for generating multiple tunable optical spectral lines in the near- and mid-IR region, which has applications in trace gas detection and imaging.

Method: The proposed method utilizes a gas-filled ARHCF to synthesize multiple independently tunable spectral lines with high pulse energy and short pulse width.

Result: The abstract demonstrates the successful generation of a two-nanometer-wide laser beam containing two narrow spectral lines, and its use in real-time SO2 and CO2 detection via photoacoustic modalities. Additionally, the method is suggested to be applicable for IR multispectral microscopic imaging.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens up new possibilities for trace gas detection, real-time imaging, and advanced spectroscopy applications, particularly in the challenging mid-IR region where existing methods fall short.

Abstract: The synthesis of multiple narrow optical spectral lines, precisely and independently tuned across the near- to mid-infrared (IR) region, is a pivotal research area that enables selective and real-time detection of trace gas species within complex gas mixtures. However, existing methods for developing such light sources suffer from limited flexibility and very low pulse energy, particularly in the mid-IR domain. Here, we introduce a new concept based on the gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (ARHCF) technology that enables the synthesis of multiple independently tunable spectral lines with high pulse energy of >1 μJ and a few nanoseconds pulse width in the near- and mid-IR region. The number and wavelengths of the generated spectral lines can be dynamically reconfigured. A proof-of-concept laser beam synthesized of two narrow spectral lines at 3.99 μm and 4.25 μm wavelengths is demonstrated and combined with photoacoustic (PA) modality for real-time SO2 and CO2 detection. The proposed concept also constitutes a promising way for IR multispectral microscopic imaging.

Abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-PT symmetry have attracted extensive interest for their non-Hermitian spectral properties, particularly the emergence of purely real and imaginary eigenvalues in their symmetry-unbroken regime, respectively. Recently, these two scenarios have been unified under a more general framework known as anyonic-PT symmetry, yet its physical implications in waveguide platforms and corresponding topological features in extended lattice systems remain largely unexplored. Here, the phase transitions and topological protection in anyonic-PT-symmetric systems are systematically investigated in waveguide lattices. In the symmetry-unbroken regime, the arguments of all bulk eigenvalues are constrained to two discrete values separated by π, leading to distinctive oscillatory propagation dynamics accompanied by controlled amplification or dissipation. In the case of one-dimensional lattice, the energy bands exhibit a gap closing and reopening during phase transition. Moreover, in the symmetry-unbroken regime, the topological edge states emerge within the bulk gap and are protected by a generalized pseudo-anyonic-Hermiticity (PAH) symmetry. Our results establish anyonic-PT symmetry as a new tunable degree of freedom for non-Hermitian waveguide systems, where the eigenvalue argument provides a natural quantity for information encoding. This work broadens the conceptual foundation of topological protection under generalized non-Hermitian symmetries.

Abstract: Sub-symmetry (SubSy) protected topological states represent a concept that goes beyond the conventional framework of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, demonstrating that topological boundary states can remain robust even when the pertinent symmetry holds only in a subset of Hilbert space. Typical SPT and SubSy boundary states decay exponentially into the bulk, which means they are not confined in just few lattice sites close to the boundary. Here, we introduce topologically compact edge states protected by SubSy, featuring extreme two-site localization at boundaries of a lattice, without any decay into the bulk. The compactness arises from local destructive interference at the boundary, while topological protection is ensured by SubSy, characterized by quantized winding numbers. Experimentally, we observe compact edge states in laser-written photonic lattices with engineered rhombic-like unit cells, confirming their robustness against perturbations under both chiral symmetry and SubSy conditions. Our results highlight the potential of SubSy protection for achieving topological confinement of light, paving the way for applications in compact waveguides, lasers, and high-sensitivity photonic sensors.

Abstract: Room-temperature, miniaturized, polarization-resolved terahertz (THz) detection of high speed is vital for high-resolution imaging in radar, remote sensing, and semiconductor inspection, and is essential for large-scale THz focal plane arrays. However, miniaturization below deep-subwavelength scales (< 1/50 wavelength) remain challenging due to weak light-matter interaction, which degrades responsivity and polarization sensitivity. Here, we present a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) monolithic detector that overcomes this limitation by maintaining and even enhancing performance at a deep-subwavelength channel length of just 2 micrometers (1/60 wavelength). The device integrates graphene rectangle PPAC arrays with dissimilar metal contacts, where graphene functions as both absorber and conductor, simplifying the architecture. Exploiting plasmon polariton resonances and the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, the detector achieves polarization-sensitive, frequency-selective, and fast THz detection spanning 0.53 to 4.24 THz with a polarization ratio of 93, featuring a responsivity (RV) of 1007 V/W, a noise-equivalent power (NEP) of 16 pW/Hz^0.5, a specific detectivity (D*) of 2.9 x 10^7 Jones, and a response time of 230 ps. We further demonstrate monolithic integration for polarization imaging and non-destructive semiconductor chip inspection, advancing room-temperature, compact, and polarization-sensitive THz technologies.

Abstract: Dynamic control of laser emission direction is crucial for developing compact and reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. In this work, we numerically present a plasmonic nanolaser (PNL) integrated with a voltage-controlled liquid crystal (LC) layer to achieve active beam steering. We modeled the orientation of LC molecules under an applied bias and incorporated this into electromagnetic simulations to assess the optical response. We observed lasing at an emission wavelength of 870 nm for the single-mode PNL, with discrete voltage-dependent deflections of the far-field emission of up to $\pm67$\textdegree, while maintaining a beam divergence of less than 1\textdegree. The steering characteristics were significantly influenced by the electro-optic properties of the LC layer, with an optimized thickness of 3 $μ$m. The structural periodicity governed the achievable angular separation and emission stability. Furthermore, we extended the concept to a dual-mode nanolaser based on a merged nanohole array (NHA), which supports two lasing wavelengths at 873 nm and 880 nm. Both lasing modes exhibited simultaneous voltage-dependent angular tuning without altering the cavity geometry. These results highlight the potential of LC-integrated PNLs as voltage-controlled, reconfigurable light sources for applications in optical interconnects, beam routing, adaptive imaging, and multiplexed communication.

Result: The results show clear anti-Stokes SERS signatures of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes, suggesting single-molecule accessibility with current platforms.

Conclusion: This work provides a basis for optimizing IVR characterization through SEVS, contributing to the understanding of molecular dynamics at the single-molecule level.

Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.

Abstract: The mean free path of photocarriers is a crucial parameter for material design, device optimization, and new optoelectronics applications. Currently, this parameter remains unknown for many materials, and experimental means available for its measurement are considerably lacking. Meanwhile, it remains an unclear issue whether the mean free path of the photogenerated high-energy hot carriers is significantly different from that of the localequilibrium-state carriers near the Fermi surface or around the band edge. Based on the concept of transient grating Fourier transform and utilizing a virtual lock-in amplification technique, we proposed and demonstrated an efficient experimental technique for measuring the mean free path of photocarriers. This method has facilitated direct observation of the photocarrier transport behavior across the transition between diffusive and ballistic motion, from which we surprisingly find that the mean free path of photogenerated hot carriers in Silicon membrane and GaAs quantum well can reach micron scale, more than an order of magnitude larger compared to the electrically-measured one. This work provides new ideas for characterization of photoelectronic devices under operating status and is expected to greatly enhance the understanding of the photocarrier transport process in opto-electronic or photonic materials.

Abstract: Molecules are emerging as new benchmark for metrology and fundamental physics research, driving the demand for spectroscopic techniques combining high sensitivity and resolution. Photoacoustic spectroscopy has proven to combine high sensitivity with appealing features like compactness, wavelength-independent and background-free detection. To date, photoacoustic sensing has mostly been focused on high-pressure applied trace-gas analysis, while accessing the low-pressure regime has been considered not compatible with efficient acoustic wave propagation. However, sensing gas samples at low pressure is the key to get access to high-resolution spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate that sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopy can be performed on low-pressure trace gases in a cavity-enhanced photoacoustic sensor with mW-level mid-infrared radiation. Moreover, we show that the same setup can be operated at higher pressure, enabling trace-gas detection with 5 parts-per-billion sensitivity with a laser power as low as 35 microwatts. This allows to extend the unique advantages of the photoacoustic technique to metrology and fundamental physics and provides the mid-infrared with a cost-effective, flexible tool combining high sensitivity and resolution.

Conclusion: Nonlocal nonlinearity can induce topological phases. The model provides a framework for exploring nonlinear topological phenomena and applying them to quantum platforms.

Abstract: The interplay between topology and nonlinearity represents a central challenge in modern physics. Here, we investigate this interplay by considering a synthetic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with all-to-all nonlocal interactions. We find that the distinctive nonlinearity maintains an effective chiral symmetry and leads to a quantized nonlinear winding and Berry phase, as corroborated by the developed Bogoliubov nonlinear adiabatic theory. Increasing nonlinearity drives a sequence of topological transitions signaled by the appearance of characteristic swallowtail band structures at intermediate interaction strengths and band swapping in the strong nonlinear regime. The band swapping results in quantized fractional windings and double-period Bloch oscillations that are closely related to discrete time crystals. Remarkably, even starting from a topologically trivial linear system, nonlocal nonlinearity can induce an emergent topological phase with fractional windings. Experimentally, our model can be realized using photons in a degenerate optical cavity with Rydberg-mediated interactions. Our results establish a rigorous framework and pave the way for exploring nonlinear topological phenomena and their applications in synthetic quantum platforms.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) are central to quantum communication, computing, and metrology, yet their development remains constrained by trade-offs in purity, indistinguishability, and tunability. This review presents a mechanism-based classification of SPEs, offering a physics-oriented framework to clarify the performance limitations of conventional sources, including quantum emitters and nonlinear optical processes. Particular attention is given to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite quantum dots (HOIP QDs), which provide size- and composition-tunable emission with narrow linewidths and room-temperature operation. Through comparative analysis of physical mechanisms and performance metrics, we show how HOIP QDs may address key limitations of established SPE platforms. Recognizing the constraints of current deterministic sources, we introduce a performance framework to guide the development of scalable SPEs, and examine the theoretical potential of bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) states, discussing how BSV mechanisms could serve as a promising avenue for multiplexable, high-purity photon generation beyond conventional heralded schemes. The review concludes by outlining future directions for integrating HOIP- and BSV-based concepts into scalable quantum photonic architectures.

THz radiation is produced by optical rectification in stoichiometric MgO:LiNbO$_3$ using a line-focus geometry, yielding single-cycle pulses of 55 - 92 nJ energy with peak electric fields of 37 - 90 kV/cm. Electro-optic sampling and beam-quality measurements reveal tunable control between central frequency, bandwidth and field amplitude by translating the generation region transversely within the crystal. Using shorter pump pulses preserves THz conversion efficiency, while longer pulses at 100 kHz reduce THz output by up to a factor of four due to cumulative thermal effects. Femtosecond 257.5 nm UV pulses are generated by cascaded fourth-harmonic generation in $β$-barium borate with conversion efficiencies exceeding 10% at 40 kHz and stable operation up to 600 kHz. These results demonstrate a compact, thermally robust platform for high-average-power nonlinear conversion and are directly relevant to next-generation high-repetition-rate ultrafast electron diffraction and spectroscopy systems.

Abstract: The reaction between NH2 and O represents a critical oxidation pathway in the combustion of ammonia and hydrazine. However, significant discrepancies persist among previous experimental and theoretical studies regarding its kinetics. In this work, we present a high-level theoretical characterization of the NH2O potential energy surface (PES) using the internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction (ic-MRCI) method with the cc-pVTZ-F12 basis set. The full-dimensional PES was constructed via the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) approach, encompassing all energetically accessible channels, including HNO + H, NH + OH, NO + H2, and HON + H. Stationary points were characterized with particular attention to the intricate multi-reference nature of the system. Based on the refined PES, we computed thermal rate coefficients and branching ratios over a wide temperature range. Our results provide accurate, first-principles kinetic data that are essential for refining combustion models of nitrogen-containing fuels.

Abstract: Mechanosensitive ion nanochannels regulate transport by undergoing conformational changes within nanopores. However, achieving precise control over these conformational states remains a major challenge for both artificial soft or solid pores. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism that modulates the charge carrier density inside nanopores, inspired by transistors in solid-state electronics. This strategy leverages a novel phenomenon of confinement-regulated ion clustering in two-dimensional extremely confined nanochannels, revealed by extensive $μ$s-scale enhanced-sampling molecular simulations based on an \emph{ab initio}-refined force field and nucleation theory. The resulting \emph{force-ion transistor} enables mechanically gated control of ion transport and provides a conceptual foundation for designing ionic mechanical logic gates. Our findings offer new insights into piezochannel mechanosensing and electromechanical coupling in biosystems beyond conformational signaling, opening pathways to integrate artificial ion channels with neuromorphic devices for processing mechanical stimuli.

TL;DR: We developed a new method for quantum scattering calculations that scales quadratically with the number of channels instead of cubically. This allows for efficient calculation of complex molecular collisions. Interestingly, this approach has potential applications in understanding complex atomic and molecular processes. More details can be found in the full paper.

Motivation: Understanding complex molecular collisions is a key challenge in fields like atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. Current methods are too computationally intensive, so we needed a more efficient approach.

Method: We applied the Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm to solve the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. This method resolves divergence issues and explicitly includes closed-channel effects, such as those involved in multichannel Feshbach resonances.

Result: We successfully achieved exact quantum results for He + CO and CO + N2 collisions, demonstrating the quadratic scaling of our method. This marks a significant step forward in computational capabilities for complex molecular systems.

Conclusion: This work opens up new possibilities for studying intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics and could lead to advancements in related fields.

Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.

Abstract: Surface energetics of zinc sulfide nanoparticles determines their structure, properties, and occurrence. Using a combination of experimental techniques, we investigated the thermodynamics of the two polymorphs, sphalerite and wurtzite at bulk and nanoscale to understand their occurrence. Calorimetric measurements confirmed that wurtzite has a lower surface energy than sphalerite, which causes a reversal in phase stability at the nanoscale, with wurtzite energetically stable for particle size below 10 nm. Taking these surface energies into account, a simple model of the thermodynamics of the sphalerite - wurtzite transformation as a function of particle size and temperature can explain the occurrence of the zinc sulfide polymorphs in environments as diverse as ore bodies and planetary atmospheres.

Abstract: The amorphous structure of nanoporous carbon electrodes in supercapacitors complicates the establishment of clear links between electrode geometry and capacitance. In this work, we examine how specific structural features govern charge storage and explain capacitance variations among carbide-derived carbon (CDC) electrodes. Two key methodological and mechanistic advances are introduced. First, we propose a physically motivated, electric-field-based definition of the ion sphere of influence, which avoids the ambiguity of radial distribution function-based cutoffs and enables a more reliable characterization of local ion--electrode interactions. Second, we introduce an ion-resolved channel-width descriptor that quantifies pore accessibility by identifying the narrowest passage a counter-ion must traverse to enter a pore, directly linking accessibility to ion decoordination. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of supercapacitors comprising realistic CDC electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte under applied potentials, we show that carbon atoms located at the edges of graphitic sheets consistently accumulate higher charge than basal-plane atoms across all electrode types. The fraction of edge atoms increases with structural disorder and correlates with enhanced capacitance, in agreement with recent experimental findings linking disorder to charge storage. Furthermore, analysis of pore size and channel width reveals that ion decoordination is governed primarily by channel width rather than pore size alone. Together, these results establish edge atom concentration and pore channel width as decisive structural descriptors controlling charge accumulation in nanoporous carbon supercapacitors, providing clear design guidelines for optimizing electrode architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.

Abstract: The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of radiolytic species created by high-energy electrons in water underpins key applications from radiotherapy and nuclear safety to environmental processing and electron microscopy. Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories'' simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \dot{\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term. These results establish MIRaCLE as a flexible and efficient platform for modelling long-timescale radiolysis, providing a bridge between Monte Carlo approaches and macroscopic reaction--diffusion schemes, with broad implications for radiation chemistry in medicine, energy, and materials science.

Abstract: The accurate modeling of non-covalent interactions between helium and graphitic materials is important for understanding quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions, with the helium-benzene complex serving as the fundamental prototype. However, creating a quantitatively reliable potential energy surface (PES) for this weakly bound system remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials. This work provides a benchmark PES essential for accurate many-body simulations of helium on larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons towards graphene.

Abstract: Recurrent fluorescence (RF) is an important relaxation mechanism in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which could stabilize them and contribute to the production of aromatic infrared bands that are observed in the infrared spectra of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this theoretical work, a statistical model of relaxation by recurrent fluorescence is formally developed, including Herzberg-Teller and Duschinsky rotation effects as well as a full account of vibrational progressions. Using canonical and harmonic approximations, the RF rate constants can be determined from the transition dipole moment time autocorrelation functions. Application to the naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene cations is presented based on quantum chemical inputs obtained from time-dependent density-functional theory. For these highly symmetric molecules, the low-lying, symmetry-forbidden electronic excited states are predicted to contribute possibly even more than higher energy, non-forbidden states. Such an unexpected contribution could increase the cooling efficiency of PAHs and, in turn, stabilize them further under the highly ionized environments of the ISM.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the thermochemical impact of post-CCSD(T) contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE, the sum of all bond energies) of first- and second-row molecules, and specifically their coupling with the subvalence correlation contribution. In particular, we find large contributions from (Q) when there are several neighboring second-row atoms. Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions. Our predicted TAE$_0$ values (TAE at 0 K) agree well with the ATcT (active thermochemical tables) values, including for the very recent expansion of the ATcT network to boron, silicon, and sulfur compounds.

Abstract: We have extended the origin-invariant length gauge (LG(OI)) approach -- originally developed by Caricato and co-workers for optical rotation (OR) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) -- to vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-α-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets.

*J. Ricardo de Sousa*

Main category: physics.class-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents an exact electrostatic formulation for finite-length conducting cylindrical shells with finite thickness, separating dielectric media with arbitrary permittivity contrast. It derives coupled singular integral equations with elliptic kernels to model induced surface-charges, and combines numerical solutions with asymptotic analysis to understand the interplay between geometry, thickness, and dielectric contrast. The study reveals that zero-thickness models exhibit logarithmic behavior, which is regularized by finite thickness, resulting in finite capacitance plateaus. The asymptotic analysis explains electrostatic decoupling of the inner cavity and charge redistribution in different limiting regimes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to provide exact benchmarks for finite cylindrical conductors in electrostatics, bridging classical analytical methods with modern numerical approaches. The study aims to address limitations of zero-thickness models and offer a comprehensive understanding of finite shell behavior across various regimes.

Method: The method employed in this paper involves developing an exact electrostatic formulation for the given problem, reducing the boundary-value problem to a coupled system of singular integral equations with elliptic kernels. High-accuracy numerical solutions are combined with systematic asymptotic analysis to elucidate the interplay between geometry, thickness, and dielectric contrast. The approach also recovers all classical limiting regimes, including the slender-body limit, short-cylinder (ring-like) asymptote, and thick-shell regime.

Result: The results of the paper demonstrate that the logarithmic behavior of zero-thickness models is a singular feature, which is regularized by finite thickness. The study shows that finite thickness leads to a finite capacitance plateau and explains the electrostatic decoupling of the inner cavity in the thick-shell limit. Additionally, the redistribution of charge between the two surfaces is elucidated by the asymptotic structure of the coupled equations.

Conclusion: The paper provides an exact analytical solution for finite cylindrical conductors, offering a precise reference solution for validating axisymmetric electrostatic solvers. It bridges classical analytical treatments with modern numerical approaches and provides a comprehensive understanding of finite shell behavior across different regimes, highlighting the regularization of zero-thickness models by finite shell thickness.

Abstract: We develop an exact electrostatic formulation for a finite-length conducting cylindrical shell of finite thickness separating two dielectric media with arbitrary permittivity contrast. The boundary-value problem is reduced to a coupled system of singular integral equations with elliptic kernels governing the induced surface-charge densities on the inner and outer faces. High-accuracy numerical solutions are combined with a systematic asymptotic analysis that elucidates the interplay between geometry, thickness, and dielectric contrast. All classical limiting regimes are recovered, including the slender-body limit, the short-cylinder (ring-like) asymptote, and the thick-shell regime dominated by the outer surface. We demonstrate that the logarithmic short-cylinder behavior of zero-thickness models is a singular feature, which is regularized for any finite thickness, giving rise instead to a finite capacitance plateau. The asymptotic structure of the coupled equations explains both the electrostatic decoupling of the inner cavity in the thick-shell limit and the redistribution of charge between the two surfaces. The results provide exact benchmarks for finite cylindrical conductors, bridging classical analytical treatments and modern numerical approaches, and furnish a high-accuracy reference solution for the validation of axisymmetric electrostatic solvers.

Abstract: The register tube marks the invention of the clarinet in the early eighteenth century, tripling the range of its ancestor, the chalumeau, and giving it the widest range among wind instruments. Opening this narrow tube causes the fundamental frequency of the played note to increase by a factor of three, from the first to the second register of the resonator. The geometry and location of the register hole condition not only this mode selection mechanism, but also the global tuning of the second register. However, existing self-sustained nonlinear models of reed instruments fail to predict whether a register transition can occur, limiting optimization of the register hole geometry. Here, we introduce a sparse self-oscillating clarinet model that includes localized nonlinear acoustic losses in the register hole. This nonlinear mechanism is shown to be necessary to reproduce register transitions observed experimentally. Using systematic exploration of the control and design parameter spaces, we identify combinations of register hole diameter, position, and chimney length that ensure reliable register transitions. We show that the competing demands of playability and tuning are only satisfied by a long and narrow tube. Our findings provide a predictive tool for instrument making, assisting manufacturers in refining clarinets as well as other reed instruments, including oboes, bassoons, and saxophones.

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric swirling spin textures that exhibit remarkable stability at finite temperatures, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications. Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\%$ to $10\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\sim4-6\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the emergence of macroscopic coherence in excitonic insulators by studying impurity-induced pair breaking in the material Ta2Pd3Te5. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, the researchers observe spectral peaks within the excitonic gap that are tunable by external electric fields, suggesting a controllable mechanism for impurity scattering. The spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled subgap states provide evidence for the origin of these pair-breaking effects. Additionally, the paper proposes that a secondary pair-breaking effect may arise in regions with significant imbalance between electron and hole concentrations, potentially influencing the critical behavior across excitonic condensation transitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which macroscopic quantum coherence emerges in strongly correlated electron systems, such as excitonic insulators, is crucial for advancing our knowledge of quantum many-body physics. This paper aims to address the longstanding question of how locally collapsed pairing can give rise to such macroscopic effects.

Method: The researchers employed scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) to probe the electronic structure of the Ta2Pd3Te5 material. They introduced Ta-impurities into the material to target individual Te vacancies, which are potential impurities inducing pair-breaking effects. By measuring the spectral properties as a function of an externally applied electric field, they were able to track the tunability of the impurity-induced states.

Result: The key findings of the study include the observation of impurity-induced pair-breaking effects, characterized by the appearance of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. These peaks exhibit a strong dependence on the configuration of the Te vacancies and can be modulated by the application of an electric field. Additionally, the spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled subgap states observed in the STS spectra suggest a complex interplay of electronic and magnetic order parameters in the material. A secondary pair-breaking effect was also identified in the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, where additional subgap states with distinct energies emerge.

Conclusion: The results of this study provide compelling evidence for a mechanism involving local excitonic depairing as a precursor to macroscopic coherence in excitonic insulators. The observation of controllable impurity-induced pair-breaking effects, along with the proposed secondary effects, offers new insights into the critical phenomena that occur at the transition between excitonic order and conventional superconductivity. These findings pave the way for further investigations into the role of impurities and competing orders in correlated electron systems.

Abstract: Excitonic insulators host the condensates of bound electron-hole pairs, offering a platform for studying correlated bosonic quantum states. Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation.

Abstract: ..In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory...

Abstract: The competition between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy in correlated systems can allow electrons to crystallize into Wigner solids. Despite researches across diverse two-dimensional Wigner platforms, the microscopic melting processes through possible intermediate phases remains largely unknown. Here, we present the visualization of electron-lattice melting in monolayer VCl3 on graphite, where two Wigner crystals coexist with markedly different critical temperatures Tc and lattice periods as stabilized by high magnetic field. One Wigner crystal possesses both record-high Tc and electron density, and undergoes melting through an intermediate nematic phase upon decreasing magnetic field. In contrast, the other Wigner crystal with a lower Tc yields a different intermediate phase during melting, exhibiting an anomalous electron liquid with an energy-independent modulation period. First-principles calculations corroborate the band-selective occupations of interface-transferred electrons in the formation of dual Wigner crystals. Our atomically resolved intermediate phases provide crucial insights into the microscopic melting pathways of Wigner crystals, enabling a phase diagram parameterized by both quantum and thermal fluctuations.

Abstract: The $m$=2 member of the monophosphate tungsten bronze family has been considered the only one in the family without an electronic instability at low temperature.

The presence of this new phase is confirmed by diffraction and resistivity measurements. Pre-transitional dynamics are investigated using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, revealing a clear Kohn anomaly. We analyze both structural and electronic contributions to the phase transition, providing a comprehensive picture of the mechanism driving this newly identified instability.

Abstract: We present a pseudospin formulation for the post-quench dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the half-filled spinless Holstein model on a square lattice, assuming spatially homogeneous evolution. This Anderson pseudospin description captures the coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled electron-lattice system. Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency. Our results highlight the essential role of lattice dynamics in nonequilibrium ordered phases and establish a clear distinction between electron-lattice-driven CDW dynamics and their purely electronic counterparts.

Abstract: We report a polarized ultrafast pump-probe study of the normal-state electronic dynamics in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals at ambient pressure. While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a centrosymmetric cubic compound, EuTi₂Al₂₀, with a diamond-shaped network of magnetic Eu ions. The compound undergoes various magnetic transitions under different magnetic fields and exhibits intriguing electronic transport properties in a specific intermediate field regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding materials with exotic magnetic properties, such as skyrmions and spin textures, is a key focus in contemporary condensed matter physics. This research aims to explore whether the observed unique transport phenomena in EuTi₂Al₂₀ could be associated with a topologically distinct spin texture.

Method: The study involves synchrotron-based neutron scattering techniques, including magnetic structure analysis, electron magnetic resonance (EMR), and magnetocaloric effect measurements, to characterize the magnetic properties and electronic behavior of the compound.

Result: In the intermediate field regime, the material displays enhanced resistivity and Hall resistivity, which remain approximately constant with field changes. Phase II is found to exist for all magnetic field directions, but its electronic response shows a moderate dependence on the field direction, differing from the highly orientation-selective behavior typically seen in other 4f-electron based materials.

Conclusion: The research suggests that the observed magnetic and electronic properties in EuTi₂Al₂₀ may hint at the presence of a novel field-induced spin texture with topological characteristics that differentiate it from conventional skyrmion lattices, offering a new avenue for exploring topological magnetic materials.

Abstract: The centrosymmetric cubic compound EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu ions form a diamond network, undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_N$ = 3.3 K and exhibits metamagnetic transitions at H$_{m1}$ = 1.7 T and H$_{m2}$ = 2.8 T for H || [100] at 1.9 K. Between these fields, the magnetization shows a step-like behavior, defining an intermediate field-induced phase (Phase~II). We investigated the electronic transport in Phase~II and found that both the resistivity and Hall resistivity are markedly enhanced, while remaining nearly field independent within the phase. Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence. These features differ from the strongly orientation-selective behavior often observed in skyrmion-lattice phases of several 4f-electron compounds, suggesting that Phase II may host a field-induced spin texture with a topological character distinct from that of a conventional skyrmion lattice.

Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the emergence of spin supersolids in frustrated quantum magnets, establishing a material-based platform for supersolidity beyond its original context in solid helium. A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials.

Abstract: Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.

We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity that is consistent with the complex phase diagram reported previously for this compound. In particular, in our study we focus on the recently identified magnetic phase in the high-temperature region. We show that while this phase is easily destroyed for magnetic fields applied along [001], it is rather stable for fields along [110]. Furthermore, we introduce a Landau theory and a microscopic toy model describing the elastic response at zero field. We reproduce qualitatively the observed anomalies for different acoustic modes, which allows us to propose a magnetic structure for this new high-temperature phase.

Abstract: We study a honeycomb Kondo lattice model in which Dirac conduction electrons are coupled to a spin-1/2 Kitaev quantum spin liquid. For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore the electronic and topological properties ofPuB6, a material with potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

Method: The researchers used low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and tight-binding first-principles calculations to study PuB6’s properties. They employed dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) and density functional theory (DFT) to confirm their findings.

Result: PuB6 exhibits a transition in electrical resistivity from a high-temperature regime with a narrow energy gap to a low-temperature plateau. Additionally, the material shows a surface-to-volume dependence of resistivity at low temperatures. Theoretical calculations using the GGA+$U$ method validate the observed electronic and topological properties of PuB6 with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: PuB6 is identified as a promising candidate for a topological Kondo insulator, offering potential for novel electronic applications due to its zero-gap surface states and unique resistivity characteristics.

Abstract: Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X. Deng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 176404 (2013)}). Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($Δρ \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.

Conclusion: 为理解 strange metals 和 heavy fermion 系统提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Strange metals represent a foundational problem in quantum condensed matter physics, and heavy fermion systems provide a canonical setting to advance a general understanding. The concept of a Kondo destruction quantum critical point is widely invoked to describe the competition of the Kondo effect and the local-moment magnetism. Here, we develop a unified field-theoretic approach, analyzing this competition from a rare approach that is anchored by the magnetically ordered side. Our analysis reveals, for the first time within a renormalization group framework, a quantum critical point across which the Kondo effect goes from being destroyed to dominating. Our findings elucidate not only the Kondo destruction quantum criticality but also an accompanying global phase diagram of heavy fermion metals.

Abstract: We study equal-time in-in correlators of massless scalar fields in flat space at one loop. Using the time-ordered decomposition of correlators together with a cosmological analogue of the Baikov representation, we systematically construct relatively simple loop integrals and make manifest why, in this setting, loop corrections to correlators are simpler than those of wavefunction coefficients. As benchmark examples, we analyse the bubble and triangle diagrams. The bubble exhibits a UV divergence that can be removed by a local counterterm, while the triangle yields a finite result, which we evaluate explicitly in terms of dilogarithms using an integral transform for the Laplacian Green's function. We classify the kinematic singularities of these diagrams using Landau analysis, identifying novel types of singular behaviour, and validate this analysis against the explicit results. Finally, we derive a factorisation property of one-loop cosmological correlators at singular kinematics, relating them to flat-space loop amplitudes and lower-point tree-level correlators.

Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((ω/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $κ$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source.

Abstract: Both the Wavefunction of the Universe and the Schwinger-Keldysh in-in formalism are central tools for analyzing primordial cosmological observables, such as equal-time correlation functions. While their conceptual equivalence is well established, a systematic and explicit map between their diagrammatic expansions has remained elusive. In this article, I construct such a map by analyzing the relation between the two frameworks at the diagrammatic level. I show that diagrams contributing to correlation functions in the Wavefunction of the Universe approach can be uniquely reorganized into Schwinger-Keldysh diagrams. This correspondence holds to all orders in perturbation theory, including arbitrary numbers of interaction vertices and loops.

Abstract: We study the symmetries of lattice staggered fermions in 2+1d. Using the symmetries, we can place the system on any sheared torus or Klein bottle. These different backgrounds provide diagnostics of various 't Hooft anomalies associated with the crystalline symmetries. We then compare the lattice model to its continuum limit. The symmetries of the lattice system are mapped in a nontrivial way to the symmetries of the continuum theories. Using this map, we match the 't Hooft anomalies on the lattice and the continuum. Along the way, we develop a general formalism to study Hamiltonian lattice models on nontrivial, compact, flat spaces.

Abstract: This work surveys a recently developed approach to the study of free point particles on Riemannian manifolds, based on the Kirillov orbit method, geometric quantization, and the geometry of Lagrangian submanifolds. We discuss that given a Lagrangian submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ embedded in a product of coadjoint orbits and a Hamiltonian $H$ attaining its minimum on this submanifold, such a configuration naturally induces free point particle dynamics on $\mathcal{M}$. The metric governing this dynamics is precisely defined by the quadratic expansion of $H$ around its minimum. Upon quantization, this correspondence establishes a relation between the $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a corresponding spin chain Hilbert space as well as a spectral equivalence between Laplace-Beltrami operator on $L^2(\mathcal{M})$ and a spin Hamiltonian. Explicit examples of this construction are presented for particles moving on the complex plane, two-dimensional sphere, flag manifolds, and the hyperbolic plane.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Abstract focuses on the stability of near-extremal black membranes with baryonic U(1)_B charge in M-theory compactified on M^{1,1,0} coset space. It discusses instability under Z2-odd gravitational fluctuations, with the instability linked to a specific dual conformal dimension operator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study contributes to understanding black hole thermodynamics and stability, with implications for AdS/CFT correspondence, potentially aiding in the development of gravitational theories and condensed matter analog models.

Method: Uses coset space dimensional reduction techniques and analyzes linearized fluctuation equations to identify instability conditions.

Result: Near-extremal black membranes are unstable under Z2-odd gravitational fluctuations exclusively when the dual operator has conformal dimension Δ=1. This result offers a theoretical framework for studying critical charge transport in higher-dimensional theories.

Conclusion: Findings suggest a connection between black hole instability, U(1) symmetries, and dual conformal operators, providing new insights into the AdS/CFT correspondence and black hole thermodynamics.

Abstract: Near-extremal black membranes with topological (baryonic) $U(1)_B$ charge of M-theory compactified on the coset space $M^{1,1,0}$ are stable. $M^{1,1,0}$ coset is a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-invariant truncation of a larger $Q^{1,1,1}$ coset, with diagonal $U(1)_B\equiv U(1)_{B,+}\subset U(1)_B^2$ symmetry of the latter. We show that the baryonic black membranes of M-theory $M^{1,1,0}$ compactifications are unstable to ${\mathbb Z}_2$-odd gravitational bulk gauge and scalar fluctuations, but only if this bulk scalar is identified with the holographically dual $2+1$ dimensional superconformal gauge theory operator of conformal dimension $Δ=1$. The instability is associated with the unstable charge transport of the off-diagonal $U(1)_{B,-}\subset U(1)_B^2$ symmetry.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The prototype of a Euclidean wormhole solution of Einstein gravity coupled to matter is the axion wormhole in four spacetime dimensions. In this primarily expository article, we spell out some details about this construction. The axion wormhole has a semiclassical description, found in the original paper [1], in which the matter system is a two-form gauge field B with three-form field strength H=dB. The two-form is dual to a massless scalar, but the wormhole does not have a semiclassical description in terms of the scalar. There is no contradiction here as the duality between the two-form and the scalar is not a simple transformation of classical fields but involves, in Euclidean signature, a Poisson resummation of the sum over fluxes. Because of the need for this Poisson resummation, the scalar field cannot be treated semiclassically in the wormhole throat. Nonetheless, it is straightforward to compute the effective action derived from the wormhole in the scalar (or two-form) language, recovering standard claims.

Motivation: Developing automated tools for simplifying special functions in quantum field theory and string theory.

Method: Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture with dynamic batching algorithm, learning algebraic identities like SL(2,Z) and SL(3,Z) modular transformations.

Result: Over 99% accuracy on training data and over 90% on extrapolation tests, indicating internalized algebraic rules.

Conclusion: Pioneers in applying machine learning for symbolic simplification with modular identities, providing new automated computational tools for theoretical physics.

Abstract: Based on a transformer based sequence-to-sequence architecture combined with a dynamic batching algorithm, this work introduces a machine learning framework for automatically simplifying complex expressions involving multiple elliptic Gamma functions, including the $q$-$θ$ function and the elliptic Gamma function. The model learns to apply algebraic identities, particularly the SL$(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and SL$(3,\mathbb{Z})$ modular transformations, to reduce heavily scrambled expressions to their canonical forms. Experimental results show that the model achieves over 99\% accuracy on in-distribution tests and maintains robust performance (exceeding 90\% accuracy) under significant extrapolation, such as with deeper scrambling depths. This demonstrates that the model has internalized the underlying algebraic rules of modular transformations rather than merely memorizing training patterns. Our work presents the first successful application of machine learning to perform symbolic simplification using modular identities, offering a new automated tool for computations with special functions in quantum field theory and the string theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We develop a geometric framework to analyze quark confinement in four-dimensional Euclidean $SU(2)$ Yang--Mills theory in terms of finite-action topological defects. Starting from self-dual Yang--Mills configurations, we restrict to \emph{symmetric instantons} with spatial rotation symmetry so that dimensional reduction preserves conformal equivalence. This requirement maps $\mathbb{R}^4$ to curved backgrounds with compact directions and, in particular, identifies the reduced configurations with (i) hyperbolic magnetic monopoles of Atiyah type on $H^3\simeq \mathrm{AdS}_3$ (from an $SO(2)\simeq S^1$ symmetry) and (ii) hyperbolic vortices of Witten--Manton type on $H^2\simeq \mathrm{AdS}_2$ (from an $SO(3)\simeq SU(2)$ symmetry). We provide an explicit field map relating the monopole and vortex variables, enabling a unified treatment of these defects within the original four-dimensional setting. Moreover, the hyperbolic monopole on $H^3$ is completely determined by its holographic data on the conformal boundary $S^2_\infty$, which reduces a non-Abelian Wilson loop placed on $\partial H^3$ to an Abelian loop determined by the vortex $U(1)$ field (Abelian dominance and monopole dominance), without further dynamical assumptions beyond the symmetry reduction. In the semiclassical dilute-gas regime of these finite-action defects, the framework yields the Wilson area law, thereby providing analytic support for the dual-superconductor picture of confinement.

Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of a family of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric scalar field theories on the Bethe lattice (the tree limit of regular hyperbolic tessellations) using both the non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group and lattice perturbation theory. The family is indexed by the parameter $ζ\in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $ζ$. Specifically, $ζ=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0<ζ<1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $ζ$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $ζ=1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that a scalar $φ^4$ theory and the discrete Ising model on the same underlying lattice may lie in distinct universality classes.

Conclusion: 该方法通过改变截断函数，提供了研究AdS/CFT对偶和量子引力的新途径。

Abstract: There is a method for constructing from first principles, a holographic bulk dual action in Euclidean $AdS_{d+1}$ space for a $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the boundary, starting from the Polchinski's Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) equation that describes the RG evolution of the interaction part of the boundary Wilson action. The bulk action in $AdS_{d+1}$ has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry and is obtained from the evolution operator of the Polchinski's ERG equation by a map that involves a field redefinition and requires a $\textit{special}$ form of the UV cutoff function in the ERG equation. In this paper, we show that for $\textit{any form}$ of the cutoff function, the ERG evolution operator has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry. The generators of the special conformal transformation depend on the cutoff function. For the special cutoff function that maps to $AdS$ space, the transformations have the standard form of $AdS$ isometry. We also show that the ERG evolution operator for the $\textit{full}$ Wilson action can be put in the same form as the Polchinski's ERG equation by a field redefinition and consequently also has an $SO(1,d+1)$ symmetry for any cutoff function.

Abstract: We investigate the long-distance behavior of dyonic loop operators in 4d $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ using the 3d monopole semiclassics. If we employ the naive definition of the 't Hooft loop in the Abelianized regime, the dyonic loop operators do not admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory. Moreover, if one forcibly proceeds with the computations of their expectation values, all the dyonic loops turn out to show the area law, which contradicts the prediction of the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. In this paper, we resolve this puzzle by employing the notion of screening for line operators, and we argue that the dyonic loops are screened by a defect known as the twist vortex, which is non-dynamical in the infrared effective theory but is dynamical in the original ultraviolet theory. The dyonic loops properly dressed by twist vortices admit the well-defined computations within the effective field theory, and we reproduce the kinematic prediction of the Wilson-'t~Hooft classification using the $3$d monopole semiclassics. Furthermore, we apply our framework to the thermal deconfined phase to evaluate the dual string tension, elucidating the topological nature of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ domain walls. We confirm that the domain-wall state has the phase transition at $θ=π$ in the thermal deconfined phase despite the fact that the bulk state is smooth there.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the unitarity of quantum field theory, through the positivity of spectral functions, underlies thermodynamic irreversibility for a subsystem separated by a horizon, in direct analogy with the irreversibility of renormalization-group flows. To this end, we explicitly find the shear and bulk viscosities -- the entanglement viscosities -- for thermal radiation in Rindler space using the universal spectral representation. A direct consequence of the obtained general formulas is the relationship between the acceleration-induced shear viscosity in flat space and the conformal quantum anomaly in curved space, pointing to a possible novel probe of the conformal anomaly in systems with extreme acceleration. Moreover, for conformal field theories, we explicitly show that globally entanglement viscosity saturates the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound.

Abstract: I generalize the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in the climbing scenario inspired by ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric strings to a broader class of exponential potentials, under some assumptions on the smoothing effects of String Theory that favor a bounce Cosmology. The extension can encompass the SO(16)xSO(16) model, together with other scenarios related to supersymmetry breaking in String Theory. The e-fold ranges compatible with Planck data move toward lower values of N for milder potentials and toward larger values for steeper ones. I also compute the three-point amplitudes involving graviton modes in the same bounce scenario, showing in detail their lack of peculiar contributions from the turning point.

Assuming Hypothesis H that the 4-flux in M-Theory is flux quantized in a non-abelian cohomology theory called 4-cohomotopy, and the three-flux on the M5 brane worldvolume in (twisted) 3-cohomotopy, we compute the minimal model for the cyclification of the quaternionic Hopf fibration which encodes the Bianchi identities for the fluxes on the D4 brane worldvolume after double dimensional reduction. The two pictures can be mapped to each other, and thus at the rational level, we conjecture a non-abelian relative cohomology theory for the D4 brane, fibered over the 10d Type IIA spacetime fluxes.

Abstract: Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $λφ^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $λφ^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.

Abstract: A nontrivial peculiarity of general relativity is that when the horizon region of black holes is rendered harmless, the exterior doubles, resulting in a causally disconnected parallel universe. This intricacy plays a central role in 't Hooft's unitarity arguments, emphasising an exact identification between the physical universe and its duplicate on the other side of the horizon. However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We demonstrate that the mismatch in the Boltzmann factor gets fixed if the state that forms the corresponding density matrix adopts a generalised thermofield double structure. That leaves room for some interesting discussion.

TL;DR: Black hole interiors can be studied using boundary correlation functions, and analytic continuations probe these interiors through timelike geodesics in rotating and charged black holes. These continuations are implemented in both momentum and position space, with position space including non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. Applications include probing inner horizon instabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole interiors is a key goal in theoretical physics. Analytic continuations of boundary correlation functions provide a new way to probe these interiors, potentially shedding light on their properties and instabilities.

Method: The authors use the geodesic approximation and consider analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. They work with the momentum space two-point function and implement these continuations in both momentum and position space. In position space, they include non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. Their method is applied explicitly to the rotating BTZ black hole and AdS Schwarzschild.

Result: The study shows that analytic continuations of boundary correlation functions can capture contributions from interior geodesics. In position space, these continuations include non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. For the rotating BTZ black hole, the authors demonstrate that interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator. They also suggest using these continuations to probe the instability of inner horizons from the boundary.

Conclusion: This paper introduces a novel method to study black hole interiors using boundary correlation functions and analytic continuations. The method is validated in several black hole backgrounds, showing promising applications in understanding black hole instabilities and quantum gravity effects.

Abstract: Features of the black hole interior can be extracted from the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions. Working in the geodesic approximation, we find analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. These generate contributions from timelike geodesics that thread the interior and emerge in a future universe. We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators. These correspond to non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. We demonstrate this explicitly in the rotating BTZ black hole by showing that the interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator and motivate a picture for how these contributions arise in higher dimensions. For AdS Schwarzschild, we identify the analytically continued solution that captures the bouncing geodesic. We discuss the possibility of using these continuations to probe the instability of inner horizons from the boundary.

Abstract: We introduce a streamlined method for evaluating in-in loop integrals using dimensional regularization for diagrams with an arbitrary number of external legs and vertices, which complements earlier work and facilitates the extraction of the ultraviolet contributions. The method leads us to identify an apparent difficulty to renormalize with Hamiltonian counterterms within the in-in formalism. We also discuss the importance of the finite parts of loop corrections that can be distinguished from their associated counterterm contributions. As an application, we examine the one-loop primordial bispectrum in the context of the effective field theory of inflation, considering a specific set of interactions, and identifying a contribution distinguishable from its tree-level counterpart.

### [97] [Sample Complexity for Embedded Multipartite Entanglement Witness via Pauli and Clifford Classical Shadows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00859)
*Ziran Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study shows that estimating subsystem entanglement using classical shadows has varying efficiency based on how 'local' or 'global' the witness is. Local witnesses are more efficient with Pauli measurements, while global ones require more resources, transitioning to Clifford measurements for higher global witnesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting entanglement in many-qubit systems is resource-heavy, so finding efficient methods is crucial.

Method: Used classical shadow protocol to assess sample complexity for estimating entanglement witnesses in larger systems.

Result: Different scaling efficiencies depending on witness locality, with a clear crossover between Pauli and Clifford measurements.

Conclusion: Efficient measurement strategies depend on the structure of the entanglement witness used.

Abstract: Detecting multipartite entanglement in many qubit systems is measurement-intensive, motivating protocols that estimate only selected observables with provable efficiency. In this work we use the classical shadow protocol to study the sample complexity required to estimate a family of subsystem $n$-partite entanglement witness embedded in an larger $N$-qubit system. We derive ensemble dependent variance bounds that lead to qualitatively distinct scaling for the snapshots cost at fixed additive error $ε$ with numerical simulations confirm these trends, exhibiting a clear crossover from Pauli favorable performance for local witness to Clifford favorable performance as the witness becomes more global.

Result: 该研究展示了时间强制性措施如何能够以指数下降的概率防止分叉攻击，并突出显示了执行连续性作为系统安全的一个未被充分探索的方面。

Conclusion: 论文的结论是：时间强制性监督是系统安全中的一个重要视角，并且通过该论文提出的QSCW，可以在量子系统中有效地实现这一目标。

Abstract: We introduce the Quantum State Continuity Problem (QSCP), a security objective orthogonal to identity authentication that captures whether a systems current execution is a legitimate continuation of a unique past execution. We show that classical and stateless quantum authentication mechanisms fail to enforce continuity and remain vulnerable to fork attacks. To address this gap, we propose the Quantum State Continuity Witness (QSCW), a minimal quantum-assisted primitive that enforces temporal linkage of execution through stateful quantum evolution and cumulative auditing. Using a GHZ-based toy instantiation and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that temporal enforcement suppresses fork attacks with exponential decay in success probability, while remaining robust to noise and system parameters. Our results highlight execution continuity as a distinct and underexplored dimension of system security.

TL;DR: Tackle the challenge of non-Markovian quantum noise in superconducting qubits, proposing a tailored dynamic decoupling protocol that mitigates low-frequency noise, thereby enhancing entanglement fidelity in NISQ devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the push towards NISQ era quantum computing, overcoming decoherence, especially non-Markovian noise, is crucial for robust quantum operations.

Method: Utilized the post-Markov Master Equation framework, developed a novel dynamic decoupling sequence informed by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and optimized pulse timings to minimize noise overlap with Lorentzian spectrum.

Result: Achieved stronger low-frequency noise suppression, extended Bell-based fidelity, and prolonged entanglement lifetimes, effectively enhancing gate reliability in noisy environments.

Conclusion:  advancement in noise-resistant quantum gate protocols paves the way for more reliable quantum computing in the presence of realistic noise sources.

Abstract: The research on open quantum systems is important for both quantum computing and quantum sensing. So far, we can only use the main equation to make an approximate description. The dynamics of a single Fluxonium qubit under Markovian environment satisfied Lindblad Master Equation. In experiments, pulse sequence dynamic decoupling (DD) can enhance the coherence of qubits and effectively suppress noise. Two Fluxonium qubits sensitive to two-level systems (TLS) noise. TLS formed by material defects results in noise with significant non-Markovian characteristics. The dynamics of non-Markovian noise satisfied the post Markov Master Equation (PMME). The TLS noise spectrum is mainly concentrated in low frequencies, so traditional DD cannot effectively suppress TLS noise. The relaxation and dephasing behavior with a complex dynamic characteristics. Based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we put forward a novel DD sequence and design a TLS-tailored dynamical decoupling protocol by optimizing pulse locations to minimize noise power spectral overlap with the Lorentzian shape. Using PMME-consistent framework, we can obtain a stronger low frequency suppression and significantly prolong both Bell-based fidelity and entanglement. We explore specific DD design and precise modeling of entanglement dynamics under non-Markovian TLS noise. Our dynamical decoupling protocol can effectively improve entanglement gates fidelity in NISQ quantum devices.

Abstract: Quantum simulation of interacting many-body spin systems is routinely performed with cold trapped ions, and systems with hundreds of spins have been studied in one and two dimensions. In the most common realizations of these platforms, spin degrees of freedom are encoded in low-lying electronic levels, and interactions among the spins are mediated through crystal vibrations. Here we propose a new approach which enables the quantum simulation of two-dimensional spin systems with interaction strengths that are increased by orders of magnitude. This, together with the unprecedented longevity of trapped ions, opens an avenue for the exploration of phenomena that take place on long timescales, e.g., slow and collective relaxation in frustrated and kinetically constrained systems. Our platform makes use of the strong dipolar interactions among electronic Rydberg states and planar confinement provided by a Penning trap. We investigate how the strong electric and magnetic fields that form this trap affect the properties of the Rydberg states and show that spin-spin interaction strengths on the order of MHz are achievable under experimentally realistic conditions. As a brief illustration of the capabilities of this quantum simulator, we study the entanglement in a frustrated spin system realized by three ions.

Abstract: While two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference visibility has become a standard metric for single-photon sources, many optical quantum technologies require the generation and manipulation of larger photonic states. To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \pm 0.1~\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \pm 1.0~\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of "deep fringes" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology.

Abstract: We present a compact design for a beam-steering system based on acousto-optic-deflectors (AODs) used as an individual addressing system for trapped-ion quantum computing. The design targets to minimize the optomechanical degrees of freedom and the optical beam paths to improve optical stability, and we successfully implemented a solution with a compact footprint of less than 1 square foot. The system characterization results show that we achieve clean Gaussian beams at 355nm wavelength with a beam steering range of $\sim$50 times the beam diameter, and an intensity crosstalk of $< 9 \times 10^{-4}$ at all neighboring ions in a five-ion chain. Based on these capabilities, we experimentally demonstrate individual addressing of a 30-ion chain. We estimate the beam switching time of the AOD to be $\sim$240 ns. The compact system design is expected to provide high optical stability, providing the potential for high-fidelity trapped-ion quantum computing with long ion chains.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that a simple eavesdropper listening in on classical communication between potentially entangled quantum parties will eventually be able to impersonate any of the parties. Furthermore, the attack is efficient if one-way puzzles do not exist. As a direct consequence, one-way puzzles are implied by reusable authentication schemes over classical channels with quantum pre-shared secrets that are potentially evolving.
  As an additional application, we show that any quantum money scheme that can be verified through only classical queries to any oracle cannot be information-theoretically secure. This significantly generalizes the prior work by Ananth, Hu, and Yuen (ASIACRYPT'23) where they showed the same but only for the specific case of random oracles. Therefore, verifying black-box constructions of quantum money inherently requires coherently evaluating the underlying cryptographic tools, which may be difficult for near-term quantum devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensing typically requires clean reference signals, which are often hard to obtain. The development of a framework that can work without these references is motivated by the need for efficient and practical solutions in this field.

Method: The framework employs two sets of noisy signals with identical statistical distributions to train a self-supervised deep learning model. The method leverages techniques like wavelet transform and Kalman filtering as benchmarks.

Result: The framework surpasses wavelet transform and Kalman filtering, achieving an equivalent denoising effect to 10,000-set averaging while drastically reducing computation time by three orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: This framework provides a more efficient approach for noise suppression in Rydberg sensors, validated across diverse noise profiles, and offers insights into optimizing deep learning architectures for such systems.

Abstract: We report a self-supervised deep learning framework for Rydberg sensors that enables single-shot noise suppression matching the accuracy of multi-measurement averaging. The framework eliminates the need for clean reference signals (hardly required in quantum sensing) by training on two sets of noisy signals with identical statistical distributions. When evaluated on Rydberg sensing datasets, the framework outperforms wavelet transform and Kalman filtering, achieving a denoising effect equivalent to 10,000-set averaging while reducing computation time by three orders of magnitude. We further validate performance across diverse noise profiles and quantify the complexity-performance trade-off of U-Net and Transformer architectures, providing actionable guidance for optimizing deep learning-based denoising in Rydberg sensor systems.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的视角，为学习多维量子游走和探索量子系统提供古典随机过程分析途径。

Abstract: This paper establishes a robust link between quantum dynamics and classical ones by deriving probabilistic representation for both continuous time and discrete time quantum walks. We first adapt Molchanov formula, originally employed in the study of Schrodinger operators on multidimensional integer lattice, to characterize the evolution of continuous time quantum walks. Extending this framework, we develop a probabilistic method to represent discrete time quantum walks on an infinite integer line, bypassing the locality constraints that typically inhibit direct application of Molchanov formula. The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution. Our results suggest that this probabilistic lens offer a powerful alternative for learning multidimensional quantum walks and provides new analytical pathways for investigating quantum systems via classical stochastic processes.

Abstract: We explore theoretically and experimentally the recently demonstrated modulation transfer protocol [D.-A. Trinh, K. V. Adwaith, M. Branco, A. Rouxel, S. Welinski, P. Berger, F. Goldfarb, and F. Bretenaker, Applied Physics Letters 125, 154001 (2024)] aiming at extending the bandwidth of quantum RF receivers based on hot Rydberg atoms. This protocol is based on a phase modulation of the coupling beam, which is transformed by the nonlinear response of the atoms into an amplitude modulation of the probe beam. We develop a theoretical model to optimize both the modulation frequency and the modulation amplitude of the coupling beam, thereby maximizing the atomic response. Once optimized, the sensitivity to detuned RF fields of this modulation transfer protocol is compared with that of the conventional protocol. This comparison shows that the new protocol outperforms the usual one as soon as the RF signal to be measured is detuned by more than a few MHz and offers a complementary approach to increase the detection bandwidth. In all cases, the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations.

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，利用当前的量子电动力学技术，采用混合连续型离散型方案实现多比特量子态转移是可行的，具备可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic hybrid continuous-variable-discrete-variable (CV-DV) scheme for the single-step transfer of an $n$-qubit W state encoded in photonic Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger cat-state qubits within a circuit QED architecture. Logical qubits are encoded in even- and odd-parity cat states of bosonic modes, while effective Raman-type interactions between resonator pairs are mediated by a single superconducting flux qutrit operating in the dispersive regime. The protocol coherently transfers the multipartite W state in a single collective operation without populating higher excited atomic levels, thereby strongly suppressing decoherence. Numerical simulations based on the full Lindblad master equation, including realistic cavity dissipation, qutrit relaxation and dephasing, and inter-cavity crosstalk, show that a three-qubit cat-state W state can be transferred with a maximum fidelity of approximately $0.92$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable hybrid CV-DV entanglement transfer using current circuit QED technology.

Motivation: The study was motivated by the limitations of classical exact methods and current quantum algorithms, particularly the challenges with Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) such as parameter tuning and barren plateaus.

Method: The research involved benchmarking NV-QWOA against the MaxMin Ant System (MMAS), Greedy Local Search (GLS), the Grover quantum search algorithm, and classical heuristics for solving QAP instances with 5 to 10 facilities.

The algorithm demonstrated average case performance that was both efficient and scalable, suggesting its potential for application in more complex combinatorial optimization problems.

Conclusion: This study establishes the practical utility of quantum walks for combinatorial problems and provides a foundation for future advancements in quantum optimization algorithms.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of the emerging non-variational Quantum Walk-based Optimisation Algorithm (NV-QWOA) for solving small instances of the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). NV-QWOA is benchmarked against classical heuristics, the MaxMin Ant System (MMAS) and Greedy Local Search (GLS), as well as the Grover quantum search algorithm, which serves as a quantum baseline. Performance is evaluated using two metrics: the number of objective function evaluations and the number of algorithm iterations required to consistently reach optimal or near optimal solutions across QAP instances with 5 to 10 facilities. The motivation for this study stems from limitations of both classical exact methods and current quantum algorithms. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as QAOA and VQE, while widely studied, suffer from costly parameter tuning and barren plateaus that hinder convergence. By adopting a non-variational approach, this work explores a potentially more efficient and scalable quantum strategy for combinatorial optimisation. The results provide a direct comparative analysis between classical and quantum frameworks, characterising the average case performance of NV-QWOA. Our findings highlight the practical utility of quantum walks for complex combinatorial problems and establish a foundation for future quantum optimisation algorithms.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov consistency condition (KCC) defines the statistical boundary between classical and quantum dynamics. Its violation signifies the breakdown of a classical Markov description of temporal correlations. In this work, we establish a direct analytical connection between KCC violation and non-Markovianity in open quantum dynamics, revealing how memory effects manifest as departures from classical probabilistic consistency. Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality. Our results thus provide a unified framework linking information-theoretic, thermodynamic, and temporal indicators of quantumness in open quantum systems.

Abstract: We delineate the scope of research on the completeness of eigenstates in quantum mechanics. Based on the limit of the potential function at infinity, the proof of completeness is divided into eight cases, and theoretical proofs or numerical simulations are provided for each case. We present the definition of orthonormalization for general free states and the solution to the normalization coefficients, as well as a general set of initial states, which simplifies and concretizes the proof of completeness. Additionally, we define the spectral function for continuous energy eigenvalues. By taking the spectral function as the original integral variable of the expansion function, the relationship between the measured probability amplitude and the expansion function is endowed with the physical meaning of coordinate-momentum transformation.

Abstract: We introduce a digital-analog quantum computing framework that enables counterdiabatic protocols to be implemented at constant circuit depth, allowing fast and resource-efficient quantum state preparation on current quantum hardware. Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors. These results show that digital-analog quantum computing enables a qualitatively new resource scaling for counterdiabatic protocols and related quantum control primitives, with direct implications for quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithmic state preparation on current quantum devices.

Abstract: Non-Markovian memory effects in open quantum systems provide valuable resources for preserving coherence and enhancing controllability. However, exploiting them requires strategies adapted to history-dependent dynamics. We introduce a reinforcement-learning framework that autonomously learns to amplify information backflow in a driven two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir. Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems.

Conclusion: Demonstrates potential of quantum hardware for studying strongly correlated systems with high precision.

Abstract: We report on a high-fidelity digital quantum simulation of Wigner localisation in a quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) electron system using a 6-qubit segment of the state-of-the-art \textbf{IBM\,Heron\,2} quantum processor. By mapping the Coulomb interaction Hamiltonian onto a 6-qubit ring lattice, we reconstruct the ground-state energy landscape for a 2-electron Wigner dimer across fifteen interaction regimes in the range $U \in [5, 75]$. This study serves as a rigorous \textbf{benchmarking} exercise, translating foundational experimental models originally developed for electrons on liquid helium into the domain of modern quantum computing. Leveraging the enhanced gate fidelity and tunable coupler architecture of the Heron 2, we demonstrate that the digital simulation accurately captures the energy minimisation trends associated with Wigner dimer formation, achieving a relative error below 7\% in the strong-interaction limit. Our results provide a crucial \textbf{proof-of-principle} validation for using superconducting quantum hardware to probe strongly correlated phases of matter with high precision, establishing a baseline for future simulations beyond the classical limit.

Motivation: 神经量子状态（NQS）在量子物理和化学中具有重要应用，但传统优化方法效率不高，需要更有效的优化策略。

Method: 提出了一种基于隐式重启 Lanczos 的二阶优化框架，将参数更新问题转化为小型稳定的 Hermitian 特征值问题，通过高效求解自动确定最优下降方向和步长。

Result: IRL 方法使 NQS 架构在极短时间内（3-5 步）以极高精度（1e-12 kcal/mol）实现，将 Adam 方法的速度提升约 17,900 倍。

Conclusion: IRL 是一种更优、更稳定、更高效的二阶优化策略，为量子神经网络的实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding work exchange in quantum systems is crucial for developing efficient quantum devices.

Method: The paper applies the autonomous framework to analyze energy exchanges in quantum systems, focusing on mechanisms like population inversion and coherence.

Result: Autonomous framework highlights additional work mechanisms beyond traditional models, especially in semi-classical contexts.

Conclusion: The study suggests that autonomous thermodynamics offers a more nuanced view for quantum device optimization.

Abstract: Traditional quantum thermodynamic frameworks associate work to energy exchanges induced by unitary transformations generated by external controls, and heat to energy exchanges induced by bath interaction. Recently, a framework was introduced aiming at extending the thermodynamic formalism to genuine quantum settings, also referred to as autonomous quantum systems: free from external controls, only quantum systems interacting with each other. In this paper, we apply such a thermodynamic framework to common experimental situations of interacting quantum systems. In situations where traditional frameworks detect only heat exchanges, the recent autonomous thermodynamic framework points at work exchanges based on two mechanisms: population inversion and coherence generation / consumption. Such mechanisms are well known in the literature for being related to work expenditure and extraction, in particular in relation with ergotropy, which emphasizes the relevance of the autonomous framework and the limitations of traditional ones. Furthermore, the autonomous framework also identifies a genuine non-unitary mechanism of work exchange related to athermality. %, also pointed out as a resource for work extraction. Finally, in the semi-classical limit, the autonomous framework identifies all energy exchanges as pure work, but distinguishes between local work and interaction energy.
  Our results show that the autonomous framework provides a refined analysis of work exchange mechanisms in the quantum realm and serves as a consistent approach to analyze thermodynamic processes in realistic quantum devices.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum entanglement in many-body systems is fundamental but challenging, especially in complex systems like coupled three-body oscillators.

Method: A geometrical diagonalization approach with Euler angle constraints and the Wigner function framework is used to derive analytical expressions for linear entropy and purity under specific bipartitions.

Result: Excitations enhance correlation redistribution, with entanglement intensity controlled by mixing angles, and symmetry relations are observed in entropy distributions.

Conclusion: This work provides new insights into entanglement dynamics in coupled harmonic oscillators, advancing our understanding of many-body quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement serves as a key phenomenon in understanding correlations in many-body systems, but analytical results remain scarce for coupled three-body oscillators. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a geometrical diagonalization approach that constrains Euler angles, thereby reducing the degrees of freedom in the entanglement analysis. It consists of deriving analytical expressions for linear entropy and purity under the bipartitions $(x|yz)$, $(y|xz)$, and $(xy|z)$ using the Wigner function framework. Our results indicate that excitations in any oscillator basically enhance the redistribution of correlations across the system. The mixing angle $θ$ governs entanglement intensity, ranging from separability to maximal correlation. Moreover, we reveal the symmetry relations, notably $S_{Ly}[(n,m,l),θ]=S_{Lz}[(n,m,l),-θ]$ and an intrinsic symmetry within $(x|yz)$. Hence, we clarify how excitation levels and mixing angles create and enhance entanglement in the three coupled harmonic oscillators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum steering in many-body systems is crucial for quantum mechanics and applications.

Method: Geometrical diagonalization approach and Wigner function framework used to derive expressions.

Result: Excitations enhance steering, and symmetric steering behavior is found between oscillators.

Conclusion: Excitation levels and mixing angles play a key role in generating and enhancing steering in coupled harmonic oscillators.

Abstract: Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to z}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\to y}(-θ),\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to x}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to x}(-θ)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\to z}(θ)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\to y}(-θ)$. Therefore, we elucidate how excitation levels and mixing angles generate and enhance steering in three coupled harmonic oscillators.

TL;DR: Paper demonstrate that in a 2D quantum system with disorder, there's a transition from an ergodic phase to a non-ergodic phase. They observe that as disorder increases, the system initially shows ergodic behavior but then transitions into a non-ergodic state, where physical observables become broadly distributed, and some degrees of freedom are frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with quantum glassiness. In contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport with a nonzero diffusion coefficient suggests more ergodic behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the ergodic-nonergodic transition in quantum many-body systems is fundamental for comprehending quantum thermalization and phase transitions in complex systems.

Method: The authors use a 2D array of superconducting qubits to study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered environment. They track dynamics in both real space and Hilbert space.

Result: A clear intermediate non-ergodic regime is observed with glass-like characteristics in the system. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow decay, indicative of finite-temperature quantum glassiness. The onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion confirm this transition. In contrast, at lower disorder, the system exhibits more ergodic behavior with significant spin transport.

Conclusion: The study conclusively shows that in two-dimensional systems, there is a transition out of the ergodic phase as disorder increases. This phase transition is characterized by the onset of non-ergodic, glassy behavior, supporting the view that ergodicity and quantum thermalization can be disrupted by disorder in many-body systems.

Abstract: Disorder in quantum many-body systems can drive transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic phases, yet the nature--and even the existence--of these transitions remains intensely debated. Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Characterizing the intricate structure of entanglement in quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge, as standard measures often obscure underlying geometric details. In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\{ω_j\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $ω_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics. Our work establishes multi-bipartition entanglement tomography as a versatile toolbox for the geometric structure of quantum information in many-body systems.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum linear system solving algorithm based on the Kaczmarz method, a widely used workhorse for large linear systems and least-squares problems that updates the solution by enforcing one equation at a time. Its simplicity and low memory cost make it a practical choice across data regression, tomographic reconstruction, and optimization. In contrast to many existing quantum linear solvers, our method does not rely on oracle access to query entries, relaxing a key practicality bottleneck. In particular, when the rank of the system of interest is sufficiently small and the rows of the matrix of interest admit an appropriate structure, we achieve circuit complexity $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log m\right)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $\varepsilon$ is the target precision, without dependence on the sparsity $s$, and could possibly be without explicit dependence on condition number $κ$. This shows a significant improvement over previous quantum linear solvers where the dependence on $κ,s$ is at least linear. At the same time, when the rows have an arbitrary structure and have at most $s$ nonzero entries, we obtain the circuit depth $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\log s\right)$ using extra $\mathcal{O}(s)$ ancilla qubits, so the depth grows only logarithmically with sparsity $s$. When the sparsity $s$ grows as $\mathcal{O}(\log m)$, then our method can achieve an exponential improvement with respect to circuit depth compared to existing quantum algorithms, while using (asymptotically) the same amount of qubits.

Abstract: The study of quantum and classical correlations between subsystems is fundamental to understanding many-body physics. In quantum information theory, the quantum mutual information, $I(A;B)$, is a measure of correlation between the subsystems $A,B$ in a quantum state, and is defined by the means of the von Neumann entropy: $I\left(A;B\right)=S\left(ρ_{A}\right)+S\left(ρ_{B}\right)-S\left(ρ_{AB}\right)$. However, such a computation requires an exponential amount of resources. This is a defining feature of quantum systems, the infamous ``curse of dimensionality'' . Other measures, which are based on Rényi divergences instead of von Neumann entropy, were suggested as alternatives in a recent paper showing them to possess important theoretical features, and making them leading candidates as mutual information measures. In this work, we concentrate on the maximal Rényi divergence. This measure can be shown to be the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. To calculate it efficiently for a 1D state represented as a matrix product state, we develop a generalized eigenvalue version of the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We benchmark our method for the paradigmatic XXZ chain, and show that the maximal Rényi divergence may exhibit different trends than the von Neumann mutual information.

Abstract: Scalable distributed quantum computing (DQC) has motivated the design of multiple quantum data-center (QDC) architectures that overcome the limitations of single quantum processors through modular interconnection. While these architectures adopt fundamentally different design philosophies, their relative performance under realistic quantum hardware constraints remains poorly understood.
  In this paper, we present a systematic benchmarking study of four representative QDC architectures-QFly, BCube, Clos, and Fat-Tree-quantifying their impact on distributed quantum circuit execution latency, resource contention, and scalability. Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways. Together, these insights provide quantitative guidance for the design of scalable and high-performance quantum data-center architectures for DQC.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of generating distant entanglement in quantum systems, which is crucial for the development of distributed quantum networks. Given the unique properties of magnons, such as strong coupling and low dissipation, the authors propose a novel two-stage protocol that integrates magnons as both mediators and qubits, aiming to achieve efficient and scalable entanglement generation.

Method: The protocol involves a superconducting resonator that mediates between a local superconducting qubit (SQ), a local magnonic system (QM1), and a remote magnonic system (QM2). The method comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer from QM1 to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. The adiabatic nature of the protocol is emphasized as a factor in its resilience against environmental dissipation.

Result: The results of the study show that the proposed protocol achieves high fidelity ($F > 0.90$) and negativity ($
eg 2 > 0.40$) under realistic noise conditions, demonstrating strong resilience to decoherence. The protocol is found to be effective in establishing entanglement between distant magnon-mediated systems and serves as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the paper presents a novel two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system. By leveraging the advantages of magnons and integrating them as both mediators and qubits, the protocol offers an efficient and scalable solution for entanglement generation in distributed quantum networks. The demonstrated high fidelity and resilience to decoherence confirm the viability of the proposed approach and its potential impact on the field of quantum networking. This work opens up new possibilities for advancing quantum communication and processing technologies through magnon-mediated systems.

Abstract: We propose an efficient two-stage protocol for generating distant entanglement in a magnon-mediated hybrid quantum system, where magnons serve dual roles as both interaction mediators and qubits. This integrated design reduces the physical component count while leveraging the inherent advantages of magnons, such as their strong coupling via magnetic dipole interactions, low dissipation, and high integrability. In our setup, a superconducting resonator interfaces between a local superconducting qubit (SQ) and a local magnonic system (QM1), which is waveguide-coupled to a remote magnonic system (QM2). The protocol comprises two stages: (i) deterministic Bell-state generation between the SQ and QM1 using shortcuts to adiabaticity, and (ii) coherent state transfer to QM2 via engineered Hamiltonian dynamics. This adiabatic characteristic enhances robustness against environmental dissipation. Numerical simulations under realistic noise conditions confirm strong resilience to decoherence, achieving fidelity $F > 0.90$ and negativity $\mathcal{N}_2 > 0.40$. These results establish the protocol as a scalable and practical building block for distributed quantum networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum resources can, in principle, enable Heisenberg-limited (HL) sensing, yet no-go theorems imply that HL scaling is generically unattainable in realistic noisy devices. While quantum error correction (QEC) can suppress noise, its use in quantum sensing is constrained by stringent requirements, including prior noise characterization, restrictive signal-noise compatibility conditions, and measurement-based syndrome extraction with global control. Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements. Our results reveal ICO as a powerful resource for metrological QEC and provide a broadly applicable framework for noise-resilient quantum information processing.

### [125] [The Equivalence between Hardy-type paradox and Logical Contextuality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01445)
*Songyi Liu,Yongjun Wang,Baoshan Wang,Chang He,Yunyi Jia*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Paper introduces a unified logical formulation for general Hardy-type paradoxes, connects their existence to logical contextuality. The results generalize prior work and resolve a misconception about the equivalence between logical paradoxes and strong contextuality. Specific case studies include (2, 2, 2), (2, 3, 3), and KCBS Bell scenarios, showing universal applicability of the findings to any finite scenario. This suggests that logical Hardy-type paradoxes can identify quantum contextuality in all finite scenarios, providing a new approach in quantum informatics and quantum foundation research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is currently no universally applicable criteria for identifying whether a given scenario exhibits contextuality, but determining the existence of Hardy-type paradoxes is a promising research direction. This paper aims to address this gap by establishing a theoretical framework that links Hardy-type paradoxes directly to contextuality, thus providing a laconic and systematic solution in any finite scenario.

Method: The work starts with defining logical Hardy-type paradoxes as the equivalent form of contextuality in quantum mechanics. It establishes a duality between the existence of logical Hardy-type paradoxes and contextuality, proving the equivalence between the two. The paper then analyzes specific scenarios and finds that the KCBS scenario has universal application potential for logical Hardy-type paradoxes, and that only one kind of logical Hardy-type paradox exists in this scenario. The paper concludes by showing that KCBS scenario logic Hardy-type paradoxes have parametrization degree higher than 2, which is the highest in the field, thus demonstrating the generality and applicability of the finding.

Result: The main results are: Logical Hardy-type paradoxes fully describe the concept of contextuality in quantum mechanics and can identify all finite scenarios of quantum contextuality. Hard paradoxes introduced in this paper correspond to strong contextuality and provide a method to expand and apply this concept to all finite scenarios. Besides (2, k, 2), (2,2,d), and n-cycle scenarios, the findings of this paper are more widely applicable than prior since they include all finite scenarios. The result directly addresses the misconception that such logical links cannot be established for general scenarios. The practical significance of this result lies in showing that logical Hardy-type paradoxes can be used universally as indicators of quantum contextuality, and the method can be applicable for any finite quantum scenario.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical advance in identifying and analyzing quantum contextuality via Hardy-type paradoxes and has practical implications for applications of contextuality in quantum informatics and foundational research.

Abstract: Hardy-type paradoxes offer elegant, inequality-free proof of quantum contextuality. In this work, we introduce a unified logical formulation for general Hardy-type paradoxes, which we term logical Hardy-type paradoxes. We prove that for any finite scenario, the existence of a logical Hardy-type paradox is equivalent to logical contextuality. Specially, strong contextuality is equivalent to logical Hardy-type paradoxes with success probability SP = 1. These results generalize prior work on (2,k,2), (2,2,d), and n-cycle scenarios, and resolve a misconception that such equivalence does not hold for general scenarios [1]. We analyse the logical Hardy-type paradoxes on the (2,2,2) and (2,3,3) Bell scenarios, as well as the Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario. We show that the KCBS scenario admits only one kind of Hardy-type paradox, achieving a success probability of SP \approx 10.56% for a specific parameter setting.

Abstract: Constrained combinatorial optimization with strict linear constraints underpins applications in drug discovery, power grids, logistics, and finance, yet remains computationally demanding for classical algorithms, especially at large scales. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising quantum framework, but conventional penalty-based formulations distort optimization landscapes and demand deep circuits, undermining scalability on near-term hardware. In this work, we introduce Hamming Weight Operators, a new class of constraint-aware operators that confine quantum evolution strictly within the feasible subspace. Building on this idea, we develop Adaptive Hamming Weight Operator QAOA, which dynamically selects the most effective operators to construct shallow, problem-tailored circuits. We validate our approach on benchmark tasks from both finance and high-energy physics, specifically portfolio optimization and two-jet clustering with energy balance. Across these problems, our method inherently satisfies all constraints by construction, converges faster, and achieves higher Approximation Ratios than penalty-based QAOA, while requiring roughly half as many gates. By embedding constraint-aware operators into an adaptive variational framework, our approach establishes a scalable and hardware-efficient pathway for solving practical constrained optimization problems on near-term quantum devices.

Result: 高椭圆性和压缩的驱动场显著提升高谐波的椭圆度；高谐波谱包含了驱动场的量子特征信息，尤其在高阶矩特性方面。

Conclusion: 量子压缩的高椭圆性驱动场为高谐波实验提供了新的研究视角，并通过实验参数的变化可以解码驱动场的量子性质。

Abstract: The atomic response to an ultra-intense driving field produces a characteristic high-harmonic spectrum featuring a rapid drop in intensity for the lower harmonics, followed by a plateau and a sharp cutoff. This response vanishes for circularly polarized classical drivers -- a limitation that can be overcome by introducing quantum features into the driving field. In this work, we show that squeezed highly elliptically polarized drivers not only enable the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process in classically forbidden regimes of large ellipticity, but also yield highly elliptical harmonic radiation with pronounced super-Poissonian photon statistics. Moreover, we show that the HHG spectral features encode information about the quantum nature of the driving field, revealing the presence of its squeezed field fluctuations. By analyzing the HHG spectral intensity dependence as a function of the driver's ellipticity and squeezing orientation, we identify a means to probe the driving field's quantum properties that intrinsically lie in the high-photon number regime.

Motivation: 量化量子系统的压缩性对于量子信息处理具有重要意义，特别是在超低噪声资源方面。

Method: 通过研究现有文献[Riccardi A]，使用不同的初始状态和多种参数（如SGI角θ、腔-环境耦合γ₀/κ和原子-腔间偏移Δ）来分析V型原子在散射腔中的熵和方差压缩。

Result: 结果表明，无论条件下如何，都不存在S_y的压缩。而S_x的方差压缩仅当Δ>0时出现。熵压缩能够更精确地量化量子波动。此外，S_x的压缩程度取决于θ、γ₀/κ、Δ以及初始状态。

Conclusion: 这些发现对于作为超低噪声资源的量子信息处理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Based on Ref.\cite{Riccardi A}, we investigate the entropy and variance squeezing of a V-type atom in a dissipative cavity, and discuss the influences of parameters including the spontaneously generated interference (SGI) ($θ$), the cavity-environment coupling ($γ_0/κ$) and the atom-cavity detuning ($Δ$) on the atomic squeezing by using different initial states. The results show that no squeezing of $S_y$ occurs under any condition and that variance squeezing of $S_x$ appears only when $Δ>0$. Entropy squeezing quantifies quantum fluctuations more precisely than variance squeezing. Moreover, the atomic squeezing of $S_x$ clearly depends on $θ$, $γ_0/κ$, $Δ$ and the initial state. These findings are meaningful for quantum information processing as an ultra-low-noise resource.

Abstract: This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay.To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.

Abstract: Stark shifts introduce additional phases that constrain the set of entangling gates that can be prepared via two-photon transitions in the strong Rydberg blockade limit. For non-independently addressed qubits, by controlling the absolute phases and the local amplitudes of the pulses at each qubit, we show that any two-qubit phase gate can be prepared with high fidelity using a three-pulse sequence. Based on these insights, we introduce two robust control schemes tailored to different phase gates that yield better results with pulse sequences of either even or odd length.

Abstract: Photon-induced Near-field Electron Microscopy (PINEM) effect has revealed the quantum interaction between free electrons and optical near filed, which demonstrated plenty of novel phenomena of manipulating free electron wave packet and detecting/shaping quantum photonic states. However, free electrons generally only absorb/emit one photon at a time, while the physical mechanism and phenomena of free electron-two-photon interaction have not been studied yet. Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory. Our work uncovers the possible abundant phenomena when free electron interacting with two photons, paves the way for more in-depth studies of nonlinear processes in electron-photon quantum interactions in the future.

Abstract: The zero-mode corner states in the gap of two-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model are robust to infinitesimal perturbations that preserve chiral symmetry. However, we demonstrate that this general belief is no longer valid in large-sized systems. To reveal the higher-order topology of non-Hermitian systems, we establish a correspondence between the stable zero-mode singular states and the topologically protected corner states of energy spectrum in the thermodynamic limit. Within this framework, the number of zero-mode singular values is directly linked to the number of mid-gap corner states. The winding numbers in real space can be defined to count the number of stable zero-mode singular states. Our results formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence for both static and Floquet non-Hermitian systems, where topology arises intrinsically from the non-Hermiticity, even without symmetries.

Abstract: Hamiltonian simulations are key subroutines in adiabatic quantum computation, quantum control, and quantum many-body physics, where quantum dynamics often happen in the low-energy sector. In contrast to time-independent Hamiltonian simulations, a comprehensive understanding of quantum simulation algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonians under the low-energy assumption remains limited hitherto. In this paper, we investigate how much we can improve upon the standard performance guarantee assuming the initial state is supported on a low-energy subspace. In particular, we compute the Trotter number of digital quantum simulation based on product formulas for time-dependent spin Hamiltonians under the low-energy assumption that the initial state is supported on a small number of low-energy eigenstates, and show improvements over the standard cost for simulating full unitary simulations. Technically, we derive the low-energy simulation error with commutator scaling for product formulas by leveraging adiabatic perturbation theory to analyze the time-variant energy spectrum of the underlying Hamiltonian. We further discuss the applications to simulations of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics and adiabatic state preparation. Finally, we prove a lower bound of query complexity for generic time-dependent Hamiltonian simulations.

Abstract: We investigate obtaining intermediate quantum states during the quantum annealing process to address the limitation of the linear weighted sum method in multi-objective optimization, which inherently fails to reach non-convex regions of the Pareto front. We validate this approach through physical experiments utilizing quench-based readout and numerical simulations assuming ideal mid-anneal measurements. Both methods consistently demonstrate a clear trade-off where earlier timing enhances diversity of the solutions, whereas later timing ensures convergence to non-dominated solutions. Notably, a practical compromise timing balances both metrics. The qualitative agreement between practical quench and ideal simulation indicates the potential of accessing the intermediate states for comprehensive Pareto front exploration.

Abstract: Fast computational algorithms are in constant demand, and their development has been driven by advances such as quantum speedup and classical acceleration. This paper intends to study search algorithms based on quantum walks in quantum computation and sampling algorithms based on Langevin dynamics in classical computation. On the quantum side, quantum walk-based search algorithms can achieve quadratic speedups over their classical counterparts. In classical computation, a substantial body of work has focused on gradient acceleration, with gradient-adjusted algorithms derived from underdamped Langevin dynamics providing quadratic acceleration over conventional Langevin algorithms.
  Since both search and sampling algorithms are designed to address learning tasks, we study learning relationship between coined quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics. Specifically, we show that, in terms of the Le Cam deficiency distance, a quantum walk with randomization is asymptotically equivalent to underdamped Langevin dynamics, whereas the quantum walk without randomization is not asymptotically equivalent due to its high-frequency oscillatory behavior. We further discuss the implications of these equivalence and nonequivalence results for the computational and inferential properties of the associated algorithms in machine learning tasks. Our findings offer new insight into the relationship between quantum walks and underdamped Langevin dynamics, as well as the intrinsic mechanisms underlying quantum speedup and classical gradient acceleration.

Abstract: Quantum theory and relativity exhibit several formal analogies with fluid mechanics. This paper examines under which conditions a classical fluid model may reproduce the most basic mathematical formalism of both theories. By assuming that the angular momentum of an irrotational vortex in an inviscid, barotropic, isothermal fluid with sound speed c is equal in magnitude to the reduced Planck constant, and incorporating Korteweg capillary stress, a complex wave equation describing the momentum and continuity equations of a Euler-Korteweg vortex is obtained. When uniform convection is introduced, the weak field approximation of this wave equation is equivalent to Schrödinger's equation. The model is shown to yield classical analogues to de Broglie wavelength, the Einstein-Planck relation, the Born rule and the uncertainty principle. Accounting for the retarded propagation of the wavefield of a vortex in convection produces the Lorentz transformation and the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schrödinger's equation appearing as the low-Mach-number limit. These results demonstrate that, under explicit assumptions, a classical continuum can reproduce the mathematical formalism of quantum and relativistic theory in their simplest form, without assuming the postulates principal to those theories.

Abstract: We are concerned with the justification of the statement, commonly (explicitly or implicitly) used in quantum scattering theory, that for a free non-relativistic quantum particle with initial wave function $Ψ_0(\boldsymbol{x})$, surrounded by detectors along a sphere of large radius $R$, the probability distribution of the detection time and place has asymptotic density (i.e., scattering cross section) $σ(\boldsymbol{x},t)= m^3 \hbar^{-3} R t^{-4} |\widehatΨ_0(m\boldsymbol{x}/\hbar t)|^2$ with $\widehatΨ_0$ the Fourier transform of $Ψ_0$. We give two derivations of this formula, based on different macroscopic models of the detection process. The first one consists of a negative imaginary potential of strength $λ>0$ in the detector volume (i.e., outside the sphere of radius $R$) in the limit $R\to\infty,λ\to 0, Rλ\to \infty$. The second one consists of repeated nearly-projective measurements of (approximately) the observable $1_{|\boldsymbol{x}|>R}$ at times $\mathscr{T},2\mathscr{T},3\mathscr{T},\ldots$ in the limit $R\to\infty,\mathscr{T}\to\infty,\mathscr{T}/R\to 0$; this setup is similar to that of the quantum Zeno effect, except that there one considers $\mathscr{T}\to 0$ instead of $\mathscr{T}\to\infty$. We also provide a comparison to Bohmian mechanics: while in the absence of detectors, the arrival times and places of the Bohmian trajectories on the sphere of radius $R$ have asymptotic distribution density given by the same formula as $σ$, their deviation from the detection times and places is not necessarily small, although it is small compared to $R$, so the effect of the presence of detectors on the particle can be neglected in the far-field regime. We also cover the generalization to surfaces with non-spherical shape, to the case of $N$ non-interacting particles, to time-dependent surfaces, and to the Dirac equation.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in reduced density matrix theory, we develop a geometric framework for describing strongly correlated lattice bosons. We first establish that translational symmetry, together with a fixed pair interaction, enables an exact functional formulation expressed solely in terms of momentum occupation numbers. Employing the constrained-search formalism and exploiting a geometric correspondence between $N$-boson configuration states and their one-particle reduced density matrices, we derive the general form of the ground-state functional. Its structure highlights the omnipresent significance of one-body $N$-representability: (i) the domain is exactly determined by the $N$-representability conditions; (ii) at its boundary, the gradient of the functional diverges repulsively, thereby generalizing the recently discovered Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) force; and (iii) an explicit expression for this boundary force follows directly from geometric arguments. These key results are demonstrated analytically for few-site lattice systems, and we illustrate the broader significance of our functional form in defining a systematic hierarchy of functional approximations.

Abstract: Quantum walk serves as a versatile tool for universal quantum computing and algorithmic research. However, the implementation of discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) with superconducting circuits is still constrained by some limitations such as operation precision, circuit depth and connectivity. With improved hardware efficiency by using superconducting qutrits (three-level systems), we experimentally demonstrate a scalable DTQW in a superconducting circuit, observing the ballistic spreading of quantum walk in a qutrit chain. The usage of qutrits in our implementation allows hardware efficiently encoding of the walker position and the coin degree of freedom. By exploiting the flexibility and intrinsic symmetries of qutrit-based DTQWs, we successfully prepare two topological phases in the chain. For the first time, particle-hole-symmetry-protected edge states, bounded at the interface between these two topological phases, are observed in the superconducting platform. Measured parameter dependencies further validate the properties of edge states. The scalability and gate-control compatibility of the demonstrated DTQWs enable a versatile tool for superconducting quantum computing and quantum simulation.

Abstract: Unit Commitment (UC) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and electricity market scheduling. It determines the optimal on/off status and dispatch of generating units while satisfying system, operational, and market constraints. Traditionally, UC has been solved using mixed-integer programming, dynamic programming, or metaheuristic methods, all of which face scalability challenges as systems grow in size and uncertainty. Recent advances in quantum computing, spanning quantum annealing, variational algorithms, and hybrid quantum classical optimization, have opened new opportunities to accelerate UC solution processes by exploiting quantum parallelism and entanglement. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing research on the applications of quantum computing for solving the UC problem. The reviewed works are categorized based on the employed quantum paradigms, including annealing-based, variational hybrid, quantum machine learning, and quantum-inspired methods. Key modeling strategies, hardware implementations, and computational trade-offs are discussed, highlighting the current progress, limitations, and potential future directions for large-scale quantum-enabled UC.

Abstract: In open quantum systems, a basic question at the interface of quantum information, statistical physics, and many-body dynamics is how well can one infer the structure of noise and dissipation generators from finite-time measurement statistics alone. Motivated by this question, we study the learnability and cryptographic applications of random open-system dynamics generated by Lindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan (GKSL) master equations. Working in the affine hull of the GKSL cone, we introduce physically motivated ensembles of random local Lindbladians via a linear parametrisation around a reference generator. On top of this geometric structure, we extend statistical query (SQ) and quantum-process statistical query (QPStat) frameworks to the open-system setting and prove exponential (in the parameter dimension $M$) lower bounds on the number of queries required to learn random Lindbladian dynamics. In particular, we establish average-case SQ-hardness for learning output distributions in total variation distance and average-case QPStat-hardness for learning Lindbladian channels in diamond norm. To support these results physically, we derive a linear-response expression for the ensemble-averaged total variation distance and verify the required nonvanishing scaling in a random local amplitude-damping chain. Finally, we design two Lindbladian physically unclonable function (Lindbladian-PUF) protocols based on random Lindbladian ensembles with distribution-level and tomography-based verification, thereby providing open-system examples where learning hardness can be translated into cryptographic security guarantees.

Abstract: Optical magnetometers use the rotation of linearly polarized laser light induced by the Faraday effect for high precision magnetic field measurements. Here, we carry out an in-depth quantum information investigation, deploying two distinct models: The first, semiclassical model can violate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound by several orders of magnitude for weak dissipation and large atom numbers, invalidating the semiclassical approach in this parameter regime. The second model, describing the atoms as a collective spin, respects the Cramer-Rao bound for all parameters. Interestingly, the collective model also predicts Heisenberg scaling for the quantum Fisher information. The comparison of both models shows that Heisenberg scaling is a result of measurement-induced quantum correlation in an otherwise non-interacting quantum system. As the Heisenberg scaling appears in a stationary state of a macroscopic quantum system, it can be thus viewed as a new paradigm in quantum sensing. Intriguingly, the comparison of both models with experimental data can constitute a test for the foundations of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic ensemble of atoms.

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a global parametric gate that generates multi-qubit entangled states in a single step. By applying a parametric drive to a common qubit at precise detunings relative to computational qubits, we directly produce two-, three-, and four-qubit entanglement with state fidelities of 99.4\%\pm0.2\%, 93.4\%\pm0.3\%, and 91.4\%\pm0.3\%, respectively. This scheme enables efficient, reconfigurable control using only microwave drives and is compatible with fixed-frequency qubits. Error analyses indicate that infidelity stems primarily from decoherence and coherent control errors, with negligible contributions from static ZZ coupling and flux noise. Furthermore, simulations with state-of-the-art parameters predict this global gate can generate high-fidelity (99.70\%) entanglement in systems of up to six qubits.

Abstract: Bargmann invariants, a class of gauge-invariant quantities arising from the overlaps of quantum state vectors, provide a profound and unifying framework for understanding the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of Bargmann invariants, with a particular focus on their role in shaping the informational geometry of the state space. The core of this review demonstrates how these invariants serve as a powerful tool for characterizing the intrinsic geometry of the space of quantum states, leading to applications in determining local unitary equivalence and constructing a complete set of polynomial invariants for mixed states. Furthermore, we explore their pivotal role in modern quantum information science, specifically in developing operational methods for entanglement detection without the need for full state tomography. By synthesizing historical context with recent advances, this survey aims to highlight Bargmann invariants not merely as mathematical curiosities, but as essential instruments for probing the relational and geometric features of quantum systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Over-parameterization is commonly used to increase the expressivity of variational quantum circuits (VQCs), yet deeper and more highly parameterized circuits often exhibit poor trainability and limited generalization. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum Private Query (QPQ) based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is among the most practically viable quantum communication protocols, with application value second only to QKD itself. However, prevalent security vulnerabilities in the post-processing stages of most existing QKD-based QPQ protocols have been severely overlooked. This study focuses on hidden information extraction under undetermined signal bits, revealing that most such QPQ protocols face severe security threats even without complex quantum resources. Specifically, direct observation attack causes incremental information leakage, while the minimum error discrimination attack efficiently steals additional database inforamtion. To address these critical flaws, the proposed multi-encryption defense scheme is compatible with existing QPQ protocols. The study demonstrates the necessity of the multi-encryption strategy for the security of databases in QPQ, providing key theoretical and technical support for constructing practical QPQ protocols resistant to real-world attacks.

TL;DR: The paper investigates why transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) samples certain degenerate ground states and proposes a method using degenerate perturbation theory to predict state sampling based on eigenvector centralities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the sampling behavior of QA for degenerate ground states is crucial for optimizing quantum annealing algorithms for practical applications, especially in fields requiring multiple optimal solutions.

Method: The authors employ degenerate perturbation theory to analyze the adjacency matrix of the graph formed by degenerate ground states, leading to a prediction about eigenvector centralities affecting state probabilities. Verification is done through toy models of varying degeneracy orders, and insights into second-order weights are drawn.

Result: The eigenvector centralities are predicted to correlate with state sampling probabilities. Verification on toy models confirms this, with second-order weights indicating local barrier information affecting sampling fairness.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that promoting graph connectivity and reducing heterogeneity in centralities can enhance QA's ability to sample more uniformly from degenerate states, providing practical guidance for algorithm design and minor-embedding strategies.

Abstract: In applications where multiple optimal solutions are needed, transverse-field quantum annealing (QA) is known to sample degenerate ground states in a strongly biased manner. Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations.

Abstract: In the years 1952 and 1965, H.-C. Wang and U. Hirzebruch showed that the two-point homogeneous compact spaces with convex metrics are isometric to the spheres, the real, complex, octonion projective spaces and the Moufang plane and as well to the sets of the minimal idempotents or pure states in the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. Here we reveal the physical meaning of these mathematical achievements for the quantum mechanical transition probability. We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means. This is an important difference to many other recent approaches that aim to distinguish the entire state spaces among the convex compact sets. An interesting case with non-homogeneous transition probability arises, when the $E_6$-symmetric bioctonionic projective plane is used as quantum logic.

Abstract: We consider the nature of the wave function using the example of a harmonic oscillator. We show that the eigenfunctions $ψ_n{=}z^n$ of the quantum Hamiltonian in the complex Bargmann-Fock-Segal representation with $z\in\mathbb C$ are the coordinates of a classical oscillator with energy $E_n=\hbarωn$, $n=0,1,2,...\,$. They are defined on conical spaces ${\mathbb C}/{\mathbb Z}_n$ with cone angles $2π/n$, which are embedded as subspaces in the phase space $\mathbb C$ of the classical oscillator. Here ${\mathbb Z}_n$ is the finite cyclic group of rotations of the space $\mathbb C$ by an angle $2π/n$. The superposition $ψ=\sum_n c_nψ_n$ of the eigenfunctions $ψ_n$ arises only with incomplete knowledge of the initial data for solving the Schrödinger equation, when the conditions of invariance with respect to the discrete groups ${\mathbb Z}_n$ are not imposed and the general solution takes into account all possible initial data parametrized by the numbers $n\in\mathbb N$.

Abstract: Quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), which restricts the system's evolution to a protected subspace, provides a promising approach for protecting quantum information from noise. Here, we explore a practical approach to harnessing QZD for robust quantum metrology. By introducing strong inter-particle interactions during the parameter encoding stage, we overcome the typical limitations of previous QZD studies, which have largely focused on single-particle systems and faced challenges where QZD could interfere with the encoding process. We experimentally validate the proposed scheme on a nuclear magnetic resonance platform, achieving near-optimal precision scaling under amplitude damping in both parallel and sequential settings. Numerical simulations further demonstrate the scalability of the approach and its compatibility with other control techniques for suppressing more general types of noise. These findings highlight QZD as a powerful strategy for noise-resilient quantum metrology.

Abstract: Unitary designs are unitary ensembles that emulate Haar-random unitary statistics. They provide a vital tool for studying quantum randomness and have found broad applications in quantum technologies. However, existing research has focused on discrete ensembles, despite that many physical processes, such as in quantum chaos, thermalization, and control, naturally involve continuous ensembles generated from continuous time-evolution. Here we initial the study of continuous unitary designs, addressing fundamental questions about their construction and practical utility. For single-qubit system, we construct explicit unitary 1-design paths from spherical 2-design curves and Hopf fibration theory. For arbitrary dimensions, we develop two systematic construction frameworks, one based on topological bundle theory of the unitary group and the other based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. On the practical front, our unitary design paths provide analytical solutions to universally robust quantum control. Simulations show they outperform conventional pulse techniques in mitigating arbitrary unknown static noises, demonstrating immediate utility for quantum engineering. Extending unitary designs to the continuous domain not only introduces powerful geometric and topological tools that complement conventional combinatorial and group-theoretic methods, but also enhances experimental feasibility over discrete counterparts which usually involve instantaneous pulses. As an outlook, we anticipate that this work will pave the way for using continuous unitary designs to explore complex quantum dynamics and devise quantum information protocols.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient implementation of parallel quantum gates is crucial for scalable quantum information processing. However, the unavoidable crosstalk between qubits in current noisy processors impedes the achievement of high gate fidelities and renders full Hilbert-space control optimization prohibitively difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by reducing the full-system optimization to crosstalk-robust control over constant-sized subsystems, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. Our method effectively eliminates the leading-order gate operation deviations induced by crosstalk, thereby suppressing error rates. Within this framework, we construct analytical pulse solutions for parallel single-qubit gates and numerical pulses for parallel multi-qubit operations. We validate the proposed approach numerically across multiple platforms, including coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers, a nuclear-spin processor, and superconducting-qubit arrays with up to 200 qubits. As a result, the noise scaling is reduced from exponential to linear for parallel single-qubit gates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction is achieved for parallel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, our method does not require precise knowledge of crosstalk strengths and makes no assumption about the underlying qubit connectivity or lattice geometry, thereby establishing a scalable framework for parallel quantum control in large-scale quantum architectures.

Abstract: The foundational work by Bell led to an interest in understanding non-local correlations that arise from entangled states shared between distinct, spacelike-separated parties, which formed a foundation for the theory of quantum information processing. We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations.

Abstract: Compilers transform code into action. They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains.
  The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers.
  This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks.

Abstract: We consider the generation of photonic graph states in a linear optics setting where sequential non-deterministic fusion measurements are used to build large graph states out of small linear clusters and develop a framework to optimize the building process using graph theoretic characterizations of fusion networks. We present graph state generation protocols for linear cluster resource states and Type-I/Type-II fusions which are adaptive to fusion failure, that is, they reuse leftover graph states in the remaining building process. To estimate hardware costs, we interpret our protocols as finite Markov processes. This viewpoint allows to cast the expected number of fusion measurements until success as a first passage problem. We then deploy a pipeline of polynomial algorithms to optimize arbitrary graph states, extract fusion networks and find beneficial orderings of fusions with the goal of lowering the corresponding mean first passage times. We evaluate our pipeline for different initial resource states and fusion mechanisms with varying success probabilities. Results show that our strategies can reduce the fusion overhead by several orders of magnitude when compared to simple repeat until success protocols, especially for realistic fusion success probabilities between 50-75 %.

Abstract: Frequency-tunable superconducting transmon qubits are a cornerstone of scalable quantum processors, yet their performance is often degraded by sensitivity to low-frequency flux noise. Here we present a doubly-connected gradiometric transmon (the ``8-mon") that incorporates a nano-airbridge to link its two loops. This design preserves full electrical tunability and remains fully compatible with standard X-mon control and readout, requiring no additional measurement overhead. The airbridge interconnect eliminates dielectric loss, which enables the 8-mon to achieve both energy relaxation times $T_{\rm 1}$ comparable to reference X-mons and, in the small flux-bias regime, a nearly threefold enhancement in Ramsey coherence time $T_{\rm 2}^*$. This improved $T_{\rm 2}^*$ reaches the same order as $T_{\rm 1}$ without employing echo decoupling. The device also exhibits superior long-term frequency stability even without any magnetic field shielding. We develop a spatially correlated flux-noise model whose simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental coherence trends, revealing the coexistence of short- and long-correlation-length magnetic noise in the superconducting chip environment. By unifying high tunability with intrinsic flux-noise suppression through a robust geometric design, the 8-mon provides a practical pathway toward more coherent and stable superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is expected to offer new opportunities to process high-dimensional data efficiently by exploiting the exponentially large state space of quantum systems. In this work, we apply quantum extreme reservoir computing (QERC) to the classification of microstructure images of polymer alloys generated using self-consistent field theory (SCFT). While previous QML efforts have primarily focused on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, our work demonstrates the applicability of QERC to engineering data with direct materials relevance. Through numerical experiments, we examine the influence of key computational parameters-including the number of qubits, sampling cost (the number of measurement shots), and reservoir configuration-on classification performance. The resulting phase classifications are depicted as phase diagrams that illustrate the phase transitions in polymer morphology, establishing an understandable connection between quantum model outputs and material behavior. These results illustrate QERC performance on realistic materials datasets and suggest practical guidelines for quantum encoder design and model generalization. This work establishes a foundation for integrating quantum learning techniques into materials informatics.

Abstract: We present a microscopic analysis and evaluation of the dielectric susceptibility of a dielectric medium consisting of vector-type two-energy-level atoms responding on a weak probe mode when the atoms are driven by a strong coherent field. Each atom, in an environment of others, exists as a quasiparticle further structuring a bulk medium. In a limit of dilute atomic gas, the dynamics of each atom follows the Mollow-type nonlinear excitation regime, and the medium susceptibility collectivizes the individual atomic responses to the probe mode. We outline how the collective dynamics can be interpolated up to a dense medium, and we argue from general positions that in such a medium the optical nonlinearity and, in particular, its parametric part could be significantly magnified by manipulating both the coherent pump and the sample density. That indicates certain limitations for potential capabilities of quantum communication protocols utilizing the entangled photons, created by a parametric process, as a main resource of quantum correlations.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.

Abstract: Quantum computers are inherently noisy, and a crucial challenge for achieving large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing is to implement quantum error correction. A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Quantum steering, measurement incompatibility, and instrument incompatibility have recently been recognized as unified manifestations of quantum incompatibility. Building on this perspective, we develop a general framework for constructing optimization-free, nonlinear incompatibility witnesses based on convex functionals, valid in arbitrary dimensions. We prove that these witnesses are nontrivial precisely when the underlying functional is non-affine on extremal points (e.g., pure states for ensembles). For pure bipartite states, the witnesses yield lower bounds on entanglement measures, thereby outperforming most linear steering inequalities in the pure-state regime. Moreover, the construction extends in full generality to certify measurement and instrument incompatibility, where the witnesses act as genuine incompatibility monotones. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach with two operationally relevant functionals: the Wigner-Yanase skew information and an $\ell_{2}$-type coherence functional.

Abstract: Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes.

Abstract: The theory of symmetry of quantum mechanical systems is applied to study the structure and properties of several classes of relevant maps in quantum information theory: CPTP, PPT and Schwarz maps. First, we develop the general structure that equivariant maps $Φ:\mathcal A \to \mathcal B$ between $C^\ast$-algebras satisfy. Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $Φ(X^\ast X) \geq Φ(X)^\ast Φ(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps. We completely classify $U(n)$-equivariant on $M_n(\mathbb C)$ and determine those that are completely positive and Schwarz. Partial classifications are then obtained for the weaker $DU(n)$-equivariance (diagonal unitary symmetry) and for tensor-product symmetries $U(n_1) \otimes U(n_2)$. In each case, the parameter regions where $Φ$ is Schwarz or completely positive are described by explicit algebraic inequalities, and their geometry is illustrated. Finally, we further show that the $U(n)$-equivariant family satisfies $\mathrm{PPT} \iff \mathrm{EB}$, while the $DU(2)$, symmetric $DU(3)$, $U(2) \otimes U(2)$ and $U(2) \otimes U(3)$, families obey the $\mathrm{PPT}^2$ conjecture through a direct symmetry argument. These results reveal how group symmetry controls the structure of non-completely positive maps and provide new concrete examples where the $\mathrm{PPT}^2$ property holds.

Abstract: Bell inequality tests based on high-dimensional entanglement usually require measurements that can resolve multiple possible outcomes. However, the implementation of high-dimensional multi-outcome measurements is often only emulated via a collection of ``click or no-click'' measurements. This reduction of multi-outcome measurements to binary-outcome measurements opens a loophole in high-dimensional tests Bell inequalities which can be exploited by local hidden variable models [Tavakoli et al., Phys. Rev. A 111, 042433 (2025)]. Here, we close this loophole by using four-dimensional photonic path-mode entanglement and multi-outcome detection. We test both the well-known Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality and a related Bell inequality tailored for maximally entangled states in high-dimension. We observe violations that are large enough to also rule out any quantum model based on entanglement of lower dimension, thereby demonstrating genuinely high-dimensional nonlocality free of the binarisation loophole.

Abstract: To overcome the limitations of conventional liquid density sensors, MEMS-based approaches have been developed. However, the viscosity-density coupling effect often compromises accuracy in high-viscosity liquids. Although various decoupling strategies have been proposed, they often suffer from complexity and inefficiency. This study presents an AlN-based PMUT liquid density sensor insensitive to viscosity interference. The sensor employs two identical PMUTs, functioning as transmitter and receiver, respectively. An ultrasonic wave generated by the transmitter is reflected by the liquid surface and detected by the receiver. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that when the excitation frequency remains constant, the amplitude of the received electrical signal exhibits a specific relationship with liquid density, while the viscosity-induced signal amplitude variation becomes negligible. Therefore, after calibrating the PMUT liquid density sensor by fitting the relationship between received signal amplitude and density across 0-100% glycerol solutions, the device can measure densities within this range regardless of liquid type and viscosity. Experimental results show that the sensor can accurately measure the density of the propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula, with the calculated density error rate between measured propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula and actual densities remains below 0.125%, demonstrating measurement insensitivity to viscosity differences between the two liquids. The proposed method achieves maximum error rates of less than 2.5% in high-viscosity environments (80%-100% glycerol solutions), which is 20% that of other density measurement methods based on resonant frequency. The developed PMUT liquid density sensor exhibits a measurable density range from 0.789 to 1.261 g/cm3.

Motivation: Edge truncation in ULWB TC dipole arrays is a significant issue. This research aims to suppress this effect for better performance.

Method: The method involves adding T-shaped metal strips with resistors to the array edges and optimizing the excitation phase of the edge elements.

Result: The active standing wave standing ratio is significantly optimized to be less than 3.5 within a 5:1 (1.2 to 6 GHz) bandwidth, while scanning up to +/-60° in the E-plane. The effectiveness is experimentally verified.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel, effective method to suppress the edge truncation effect of ultrawideband tightly coupled dipole linear arrays. To restrain the edge truncation effect within an ultrawideband operating band, a new type of T-shaped metal strip with a resistor is further loaded on the array edges apart from extending the length of the overlapping patches. Besides, the excitation phase of the elements at the array edges is optimized. Full-wave simulation results show that the active standing wave standing ratio of the 2 x 16 tightly coupled dipole linear arrays using the proposed method is significantly optimized to less than 3.5 within a 5:1 [(1.2 to 6) GHz] bandwidth, while scanning up to +/-60° in the E-plane. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified by a 2 x 16 linear array prototype.

Abstract: We report the experimental observation of nonlinear mode-crossing dissipation and injection-locking-like stabilization in a milligram-scale diamagnetically levitated quartz cube. By optically driving the cube to rotation rate near 360 RPM, we observe that its angular velocity does not decay smoothly but instead decreases in discrete steps whenever the instantaneous rotation frequency crosses one of several higher-order mechanical modes. We observe rotational dissipation times on the order of a few days. When a weak counteracting radiation-pressure torque is applied, the system unexpectedly stabilizes at a constant rotation rate that persists for about two days, constituting the mechanical analogue of injection locking. Our results reveal a new regime of multimode nonlinear dynamics in low-dissipation levitated solids and establish diamagnetic levitation as a platform for exploring non-Hamiltonian many-mode interactions and mechanically engineered nonlinear attractors and sensors.

Abstract: The computational requirements of generative adversarial networks (GANs) exceed the limit of conventional Von Neumann architectures, necessitating energy efficient alternatives such as neuromorphic spintronics. This work presents a hybrid CMOS-spintronic deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architecture for synthetic image generation. The proposed generative vision model approach follows the standard framework, leveraging generator and discriminators adversarial training with our designed spintronics hardware for deconvolution, convolution, and activation layers of the DCGAN architecture. To enable hardware aware spintronic implementation, the generator's deconvolution layers are restructured as zero padded convolution, allowing seamless integration with a 6-bit skyrmion based synapse in a crossbar, without compromising training performance. Nonlinear activation functions are implemented using a hybrid CMOS domain wall based Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Leaky ReLU units. Our proposed tunable Leaky ReLU employs domain wall position coded, continuous resistance states and a piecewise uniaxial parabolic anisotropy profile with a parallel MTJ readout, exhibiting energy consumption of 0.192 pJ. Our spintronic DCGAN model demonstrates adaptability across both grayscale and colored datasets, achieving Fr'echet Inception Distances (FID) of 27.5 for the Fashion MNIST and 45.4 for Anime Face datasets, with testing energy (training energy) of 4.9 nJ (14.97~nJ/image) and 24.72 nJ (74.7 nJ/image).

Abstract: In this study, a multiphysics model fully coupling mass transport, deformation, phase field, and fatigue damage was developed to investigate the cracking and fracturing behaviours of Si particles during the single lithiation-delithiation cycle and fatigue damage during multiple cycles. The effects of particle diameter, charge rate, and pre-existing notches on the failure behaviour of Si particles were systematically analysed. The results showed that the increase in charge rate, particle diameter, and pre-existing notch length leads to larger cracking rates and faster fracturing of the particle. Then, a validated contour map of Si particle's fracture behaviours was developed. Additionally, the influence of pre-existing notch length and charge rate on fatigue damage was examined, and it was found that longer pre-existing notch length and larger charge rate can shorten the particle's cyclic life. Finally, to alleviate the particle fracture, nanopores were introduced in the particle, and the influence of porosity on the fracture behaviours was investigated. The results showed that nanopores can reduce expansion, dissipate global tensile stresses and elongate the crack propagation path. The developed computational framework established a predictive relationship between stress diffusion coupling theory and particle-level degradation, guiding future design and manufacturing of failure-resistant Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

Abstract: Radar plays a crucial role in automotive safety by enabling reliable object detection, thereby assisting drivers and, prospectively, serving as one of the primary sensors in autonomous driving. The radar visibility of a road participant depends on its radar cross-section (RCS). While RCS is an inherent property, enhancing it, similar to using reflective vests for optical visibility, can significantly improve radar detection through cooperative target design. However, modern vehicles are not designed for this purpose, and embedded reflectors are not utilized due to the industry's conservative approach and the limited space available on the vehicle's exterior. Rear windshields offer a vast unused area, but they must still serve their primary function and remain transparent. We propose utilizing this area by embedding a reflecting surface that accounts for the interrogation scenario geometry and the angular tilt of the rear windshield, ensuring the wave is retroreflected back to the radar. The surface is realized as an array of thin conductive wires with a periodicity that provides in-phase excitation for the design incidence angle. Given that automotive radars operate in the millimeter-wave regime (77-81 GHz), large-scale surfaces with sub-millimeter manufacturing accuracy are required. This is achieved by imprinting conductive inks, composed of silver nanoparticles and binders, into grooves in the glass. The fabricated 10x10 sq. sm. sample, with around 90% optical transparency, demonstrates an RCS of 8 sq. m., surpassing the typical RCS of a car. Extrapolating this performance to the entire rear window with an embedded meta grating, a typical RCS of 1000 sq. m. can be achieved, thereby enhancing the detectability range by nearly an order of magnitude. Smart windows enable advanced applications in wireless communication, such as automotive scenarios, IoT, and many others.

Abstract: Harmonic generation during radio frequency (RF)-dc conversion causes performance degradation of a microwave rectifying circuit. To suppress and recycle the harmonic power, this letter proposes a novel compact dual-band resonator (DBR) based on a microstrip coupled transmission line. It presents open-circuits at the second and third harmonic frequencies, which effectively block the higher order harmonic for power recycling. The conventional input cascading filters for harmonic rejection can be eliminated, simplifying the circuit topology and reducing loss. Theoretical analyses were carried out and corresponding equations were formulated for the proposed DBR. For validation, two rectifying circuits with/without the DBR operating at 2.2 GHz were fabricated and tested. Using the proposed DBR at 10 dBm RF power, the suppression of the second and third harmonic powers is enhanced by 18.4 and 7.6 dB, respectively. Besides, an improvement of RF-dc power conversion efficiency (PCE) was observed; specifically, PCE reached 73.2% at 10 dBm compared to 71.6% obtained from an equivalent rectifier.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing targets energy-efficient event-driven information processing by placing artificial spiking-neurons at its core. Artificial neuron devices and circuits have multiple operating modes and produce region-dependent nonlinear dynamics that are not captured by system analysis methods for linear systems, such as transfer functions, Fourier/Laplace transform, Bode diagram, etc. Thus, new tools are needed to evaluate the nonlinear behavior of neurons and to guide the design and optimization of artificial neuron implementations. Here we present a generalized bifurcation analysis framework based on nonlinear dynamical systems theory. A CMOS axon-hillock neuron, memristor neuron, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo biological neuron model are selected for demonstration. We evaluate Hopf bifurcation conditions to define the rest and firing domains in parameter space of the system, and predict the near-onset firing rate. The results are further compared with numerical simulations. The framework standardizes the analysis for various neuron models and physical realizations. It yields practical design and optimization guidelines for artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing systems, including parameter combinations to make a neuron fire/rest and to control the corresponding firing properties, e.g., firing rate and amplitude.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a nonlinear spin-wave Doppler effect where the motion of a magnetic boundary modulates the frequency of spin waves, enabling the generation of high-order harmonics, frequency combs, and coherent chirped sidebands without nonlinear coupling or scattering. The effect is validated through micromagnetic simulations of voltage-controlled anisotropy boundaries in ferroelectric-ferromagnetic heterostructures.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to develop a novel method for generating and controlling magnonic frequencies, which has potential applications in magnonic devices and integrated circuits.

Method: The authors propose a theoretical framework based on spin-wave theory and validate it through micromagnetic simulations of voltage-controlled anisotropy boundaries in ferroelectric/ferromagnetic heterostructures.

Result: The simulations demonstrate that the comb spacing and spectral topology are determined solely by boundary motion, confirming the direct Doppler phase coupling between boundary motion and spin-wave propagation.

Conclusion: This work establishes moving magnetic boundaries as a new class of on-chip spectral synthesizers and provides a coherent and energy-efficient framework for tuning magnonic frequencies, fundamentally different from traditional passive scattering or nonlinear mechanisms. The findings are significant for the development of advanced magnonic devices and integrated circuits.

Abstract: We theoretically propose a nonlinear spin-wave Doppler effect, in which the time-dependent motion of a magnetic energy boundary acts as an active frequency modulator, directly converting boundary-induced phase dynamics into instantaneous spectral synthesis for propagating spin-wave modes. In contrast to the conventional linear Doppler effect governed by constant relative velocity, this mechanism enables dynamic phase-to-frequency transduction, generating high-order harmonics, magnonic frequency combs, and coherent chirped sidebands, without requiring nonlinear magnon-magnon coupling or multi-magnon scattering. Micromagnetic simulations on voltage-controlled anisotropy boundaries in ferroelectric/ferromagnetic (FE/FM) heterostructures demonstrate that the comb spacing and spectral topology are determined solely by boundary kinematics, confirming direct Doppler phase coupling between boundary motion and spin-wave propagation. These results establish moving magnetic-energy boundaries as a new class of on-chip spectral synthesizers and define a coherent and energy-efficient framework for flexible tuning of magnonic frequencies, fundamentally distinct from traditional passive scattering or nonlinear multi-magnon mechanisms.

Motivation: Exploring models of compact objects like hybrid stars in modified gravity frameworks such as f(Q) gravity to understand their macroscopic properties.

Method: Performed analytical solutions in the f(Q) gravity framework using the Finch-Skes metric, considered the MIT bag model for quark matter and linear equation of state for hadronic matter, selected EXO 1785-248, and examined using graphical analysis, energy conditions, and equilibrium parameters.

Result: The f(Q) gravity model effectively describes the macroscopic properties of hybrid stars.

Conclusion: The work contributes to understanding of constructing and analyzing anisotropic hybrid star models in modified gravity frameworks.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a model for a static anisotropic hybrid star that includes strange quark matter and hadronic matter. We solve the field equations in the $f(Q)$ gravity framework (where $Q$ is the non-metricity) using the Finch-Skea metric. The relationship between density and pressure for strange quark matter is described using the MIT bag model equation, while for hadronic matter, the radial pressure and density are related by a linear equation of state. We select the compact star EXO 1785-248 and analyze five different values of the coupling constant. To evaluate the physical feasibility of the model, we perform a graphical analysis of key properties, including the metric components, energy density, radial and tangential pressures, anisotropy, gradients, quark matter density and pressure, the equation of state parameter, energy conditions and the mass function. We further examine the stability and equilibrium of the star through parameters such as compactness, redshift, causality conditions, Herrera cracking, the adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. We observe that $f(Q)$ gravity effectively describes the macroscopic properties of hybrid stars.

Abstract: We determine the metric of a Kerr black hole subject to external tidal fields using metric reconstruction techniques. Working within the Newman-Penrose formalism, we solve the Teukolsky master equation for static, quadrupolar modes associated with a slowly varying tidal environment, and reconstruct the corresponding metric perturbation in the outgoing radiation gauge. As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In particular, we compute tidal-induced shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit and the light ring. We find that these tidal corrections are strongly spin dependent, with significantly larger effects for retrograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes. Our results provide a fully analytic framework for studying tidal interactions and secular dynamics in rotating black-hole spacetimes, with direct applications to gravitational-wave modeling and tests of gravity in the strong-field regime.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a general relativistic framework used to estimate astrophysical black hole parameters by analyzing test objects in their disks. They combine this framework with MCMC Bayesian inference to determine masses, distances, positions, and the Hubble constant, challenging the standard Hubble law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is rooted in understanding the dynamics of black holes within active galactic nuclei, particularly focusing on how cosmic expansion influences such systems. This builds on the conventional empirical Hubble law to offer a more comprehensive theoretical model.

Method: The methodology involves deriving a redshift expression under the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, modeling cosmic expansion, and applying MCMC Bayesian techniques. They utilize megamaser galaxies from the Hubble flow as real-world applications of this theoretical model.

Result: The key result is the successful application of this relativistic model, offering a novel approach beyond the standard Hubble law. This has implications for more accurately determining cosmological distances and gravitational influences near black holes.

Conclusion: This study bridges theoretical physics and astrophysics, providing a new tool for estimating black hole parameters while accounting for cosmic expansion, thus enhancing our understanding of these cosmic phenomena and the universe's expansion mechanics.

Abstract: We estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk. We derive an expression for the redshift of photons emitted by a massive particle circularly orbiting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and detected by a distant receding observer. The redshift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the test particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the black hole mass, its distance, the angular position of the emitter, and the Hubble constant, for which a Gaussian prior is assumed. Our results introduce a general relativistic framework to take the contribution of cosmic expansion into account that differs from the standard empirical Hubble law.

Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures. The resulting framework connects the extra scalar polarization to cosmological observables, providing a unified, gauge invariant link between gravitational wave phenomenology and the cosmological implications of metric f(R) gravity.

Abstract: We show how quantum discreteness of spatial area is consistent with a unitary implementation of Lorentz boosts in an LQG type quantization of a diffeomorphism invariant reformulation of free scalar field theory on 2d flat spacetime known as Parameterized Field Theory (PFT). This consistency is a result of Hilbert space non-separability which is a characteristic feature of LQG representations. Our results suggest a possible interpretation of Hilbert space non-separability in terms of observer perspectives.

*Sergey Pavluchenko*

TL;DR: Kasner cosmological solutions in Lovelock gravity can behave as asymptotes in certain cases, but this is limited when moving beyond cubic Lovelock gravity to higher-order cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the behavior of Kasner solutions in Lovelock gravity as potential asymptotes, which is relevant for understanding cosmological models in higher-order gravity theories.

Method: The authors analyze different orders of Lovelock gravity to determine if higher-order solutions can serve as asymptotes.

Result: Kasner solutions serve as asymptotes only up to cubic Lovelock gravity, but not in quartic or higher-order scenarios.

Conclusion: Higher-order Lovelock gravity imposes restrictions on the applicability of Kasner asymptotes, potentially hindering compactification processes.

Abstract: In this paper we study the properties of Kasner cosmological solutions in Lovelock gravity. Recent progress in the investigation of flat cosmological models in Lovelock gravity unveiled the fact that in quadratic (Gauss--Bonnet) and cubic Lovelock gravities, the higher-order power-law solutions could play the role of both future and past asymptotes, and under some conditions, there could exist a smooth transition between them. So it is natural to question if this feature is unique to Gauss--Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities, or if it is a general feature of Lovelock gravity. Our analysis suggests that starting from quartic and in all higher-order Lovelock gravities, the high-order Kasner solution cannot play the role of a past asymptote, not only preventing the abovementioned transition from happening, but also potentially hindering the possibility of reaching viable compactification.

Motivation: Exploring alternative gravitational theories for explaining cosmic acceleration.

Method: Analyzed $f(R)=R+αR^n$ models in isotropic, homogeneous backgrounds.

Result: Extraneous scalar field freezes, leaving only Einstein-Hilbert term and cosmological constant.

Conclusion: All $R + αR^n$ models evolve to standard Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant.

Abstract: $f(R)$-Gravity, a simple generalization of Einstein's General theory of Relativity has been considered in the context of Cosmology as one of the approaches to explain phenomena such as early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe purely from the Gravity sector. In this work, we have considered a class of $f(R)$-Gravity theories with $f(R)=R+αR^n$ and it's dual scalar tensor theory in the Einstein frame. We have shown that in an isotropic and homogeneous background, for both positive and negative integral values of $n$, the extra scalar degree of freedom of the $f(R)$-theory (manifested as the scalar field in the Einstein frame action) dynamically freezes out due to cosmological evolution, resulting in the survival of only the Einstein-Hilbert term and a cosmological constant at most. This implies that all gravity models given as $R + αR^n$ inevitably evolve into pure Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant term through cosmological evolution.

Conclusion: 加速Kerr黑洞对能提取和能转换的模式有显著影响

Abstract: This paper investigates the repetitive Penrose process in accelerating Kerr black holes and explores the influence of the acceleration factor on the repetitive Penrose process. After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies.

Abstract: In this work, we derive a universal upper bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$, in the presence of an anisotropic matter field satisfying the weak energy condition and a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Using the effective potential method, we obtain the bound $r_γ\le [(n-1)M]^{\frac{1}{n-3}}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass of the black hole. This bound reduces to $r_γ\le 3M$ in four dimensions, consistent with the known result in the literature. Our result provides a dimension-dependent upper bound for photon spheres and deepens the understanding of spacetime structure in higher-dimensional gravitational theories.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the electric Penrose energy extraction for charged particles in the spacetime of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole. We first derive the equations of motion and effective potential for charged particles around the black hole. Subsequently, we investigate the Penrose process for such particles, analyze how the generalized ergoregion boundary is influenced by the particle's charge, angular momentum, and the quantum parameter $ζ$, and calculate the energy-extraction efficiency. We then investigate the subsequent motion of charged particles in the electric Penrose process, and rigorously prove that under specific simplified conditions, the resulting fragment particle can always carry more energy back to a distant observer--a conclusion applicable to a wide range of charged black hole models. Finally, we examine a special class of the electric Penrose process, wherein the initial particle cannot escape the black hole, but the high-energy fragment produced through splitting may still escape successfully. Moreover, it is observed that $ζ$ slightly alters the particle trajectories, but under specific initial conditions, it can qualitatively change the outcome: a particle that escapes in the classical Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime may become trapped in the quantum-corrected one. These results demonstrate the obstructive effect of quantum corrections on the Penrose process and provide potential kinematic signatures to distinguish quantum-corrected from classical Reissner-Nordström black holes.

The initial data contain no trapped surfaces, and the future development contains multiple causally independent trapped regions that dynamically form from localized subsets of the initial slice. In particular, the maximal development of data with well-separated collapsing components and relative motion is expected to yield spacetimes containing multiple black holes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the observational signatures of a static, spherically symmetric black hole embedded in a spontaneous Kalb-Ramond (KR) background. By normalizing the solution to the physically observable mass $M_{\text{phys}}$, we demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the KR black hole are consistent with General Relativity, with no deviations in the entropy-area law. However, the Lorentz-violating parameter $l$ induces distinct geometric effects: it suppresses the optical shadow radius by a factor of $\sqrt{1-l}$ and hardens the quasinormal mode frequency by the inverse factor. Utilizing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for Sagittarius A*, and assuming the mass prior derived from stellar dynamics, we place a constraint of $l \lesssim 0.19$. While the product of the shadow radius and ringdown frequency remains degenerate with General Relativity, the specific suppression of the shadow size offers a viable pathway to constrain Planck-scale physics with current and future horizon-scale imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this study, we proceed to solve the field equations of the spatially flat Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model in the presence of the cosmological constant \(Λ\) by making use of the Invariants of Hamilton-Jacobi method (IHJM). This method enables us to extract systematically two independent first integrals such as \(l_{\rm HJ,1}(a,\dot{a})=c_{1}\) and \(l_{\rm HJ,2}(t,a,\dot{a})=c_{2}\) associated to the transformations group keeping the form of the Hamilton's canonical equations (HCEs) of the cosmological model invariant. Extracting these invariants means not only finding the general solution of the field equations of the model, but also obtaining the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions for the model whose dynamics acts like the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional mini-super space \(\mathbb{Q}=(a)\). In addition, to obtain the general solution of the model, the IHJM have also solved the inverse problem of calculus of variation (IPCV) without resorting to Helmholtz conditions and whether the necessary conditions for the existence of the Lagrangian function are hold or not. The main part of the IHJM is to find the generating function of the canonical transformation (CT) and then extract two independent invariants for the desired model by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). This study shows that there is a close relationship between the group of the CTs of the Hamiltonian function of the particle and the one-parameter Lie group of transformations keeping invariant the Einstein-Friedmann dynamical equation (EFDE) \(\ddot{a}=F(a,\dot{a})\), so that both of them lead to the same result. In this way, having both the IHJM and the invariants of the symmetry groups method (ISGM), a comprehensive integration theory by unifying them can be achieved for studying the desired models.

Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies is crucial for testing alternative theories of gravity and explaining their unique kinematic properties.

Method: The authors applied both Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Verlinde's emergent gravity model to calculate radial accelerations in 23 dwarf spheroidal galaxies. They compared the calculated values with observed radial accelerations.

Result: Verlinde's emergent gravity consistently provided a better fit to the observed data, with statistical significance ranging from -0.25σ to 3.41σ, leading to a 5.2σ preference over MOND.

Conclusion: The findings support Verlinde's emergent gravity as a more accurate model for explaining the dynamics of dwarf spheroidal galaxies compared to MOND.

Abstract: We apply Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) and Verlinde's emergent gravity separately to calculate the radial accelerations in 23 dwarf spheroidals. Then, we compare them with the observed radial accelerations. In our earlier work, we determined that, when the data set is considered in its entirety without isolating individual dwarf spheroidal, Verlinde's emergent gravity is in close agreement with the observed values. In the present work, we additionally confirm that, for 21 of the 23 samples examined, Verlinde's emergent gravity follows the trend of the observed values within each dwarf spheroidal more closely than MOND. Combining the statistical significance of all the 23 samples, ranging from $-0.25σ$ to 3.41$σ$, we conclude that Verlinde's emergent gravity is favored over MOND at 5.2$σ$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We have studied the shadows of a circular disformal Kerr black hole with a deformation parameter, which represents a rotating solution within a generalized scalar-tensor framework of Horndeski gravity that characterized by second-order field equations. Our result show that for the non-rotating case, the shadow remains perfectly circular, with its radius independent of the deformation parameter. For the rotating case, the size of the shadow decreases as the deformation parameter decreases, and the shape of the shadow gradually becomes more flattened. It is worth noting that while the shadow of a rotating black hole remains north-south symmetric for equatorial observers, this symmetry is broken once the observer moves away from the equatorial plane. For an observer in the northern hemisphere, the geometric center of the shadow shifts northward when $D_0<0$ and southward when $D_0>0$, while the opposite behavior occurs for observers in the southern hemisphere. These features in the black hole shadow originating from the scalar field could help us to understand the circular disformal Kerr black hole and generalized scalar-tensor framework of Horndeski gravity.

Abstract: We compute the gravitational fluxes and waveform for eccentric compact binaries including matter effects through adiabatic tidal interactions within the post-Newtonian approximation. The computations are performed at the relative 2.5PN order. Using the dynamics derived in the companion paper, we first derive the radiated energy and angular momentum, from which we deduce the equations describing the secular evolution of the orbital elements. We numerically solve for the secular dynamics for various systems. We find that the eccentric corrections to tidal terms induce a dephasing that could potentially be detectable in some regions of the parameter space of gravitational wave sources. Finally, we compute the amplitude of the strain, decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics. Besides the memory contributions that are left for future works, we provide the amplitude modes containing the instantaneous, tail and post-adiabatic corrections expanded to the twelfth order in eccentricity. All relevant results are provided in an ancillary file.

Abstract: In the present work, we numerically investigate the horizon structure of the Kerr-Sen black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Further, we investigate the phase transitions and critical phenomena in Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at the critical points. Such black holes are characterized by its mass ($M$), the dilaton charge ($Q$), and the negative cosmological constant, $Λ(<0)$. We define a dimensionless parameter $ε=\bar{J}/{\bar{Q}^2}$ and express the mass, temperature, volume, and Gibbs free energy in terms of $ε$ and its polynomials. Moreover, we numerically fit the data for the critical points and find that in the appropriate limit, the expressions for critical points would correspond to the respective critical points of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. Such a study involves a systematic analysis of temperature, Gibbs free energy, and volume in the extended phase space. We provide an analytical verification of the nature of the phase transitions at the critical points by introducing the Ehrenfest equations. We also check that all three quantities, e.g., the specific heat at constant pressure, $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient, $α$, and the isothermal compressibility, $κ_T$, diverge at the critical points. We find the $Prigogine$-$Defay$ ratio using the expressions of $C_P$, $α$, and $κ_T$, and find that it identically equals unity. Hence, the phase transition behavior of the Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at their critical points is of second order. In addition, we propose investigating the energy extraction process via the Penrose process. Later, we calculate the speed of sound and adiabatic compressibility for the rotating Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes. Finally, on a specific note, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) dual to the extended phase space.

Motivation: This research explores the thermodynamic properties of the FRW universe, leveraging its van der Waals-like equation of state to investigate its potential as a heat engine.

Method: The authors derive a phase diagram from the equation of state and analyze two types of cycles—Carnot and rectangular—within this diagram to assess the heat engine characteristics.

Result: The findings demonstrate that the rectangular cycle's efficiency consistently remains below the Carnot efficiency, consistent with established thermodynamic principles.

Conclusion: The study contributes to understanding the thermodynamic properties of the FRW universe, particularly its heat engine characteristics, and validates traditional thermodynamic limits through the analysis of different cycles.

Abstract: It is well known that the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe is a dynamical spacetime, and it has thermodynamics embodied on the apparent horizon. Notably, it also possesses a van der Waals-like equation of state, enabling us to consider thermodynamic cycles and explore the FRW universe's potential as a heat engine. In this paper, we investigate two types of cycles--the Carnot cycle and the rectangular cycle--based on the phase diagram derived from the equation of state, to study the heat engine characteristics of the FRW universe. Furthermore, we calculate the work done and assess the corresponding efficiencies, illustrating the efficiency diagram for the FRW universe's heat engine. We observe that the efficiency of the rectangular cycle consistently remains below unity and never exceeds the Carnot efficiency--the thermodynamic upper limit. This finding aligns with traditional thermodynamic principles governing heat engines.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of mass inflation in the interior of regular black holes arising in quasitopological gravity (QTG). These geometries are characterized by a bounded curvature core and the presence of an inner (Cauchy) horizon located near the fundamental scale $\ell$. To examine whether mass inflation persists in this setting, we model the interaction of ingoing and outgoing perturbations by considering the collision of two spherical null shells inside the black hole. Using the Dray-'t\,Hooft-Barrabes-Israel junction condition, we derive conditions under which the metric function and curvature invariants may experience significant amplification near the inner horizon. Our analysis shows that, unlike in classical Reissner--Nordström or Kerr geometries, significant mass inflation requires shell intersection at radii very close to the horizon, with radial separations from it of the order $r-r_* \lesssim \ell \big(\ell/r_g\big)^{2n(D-3)}$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the black hole, $D$ is the number of spacetime dimensions and $n\ge 1$ is a parameter depending on a concrete QTG model. For macroscopic black holes with $r_g\gg \ell$ this distance is much smaller than the fundamental scale $\ell$. We discuss possible consequences of this effect.

Abstract: The Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity is conventionally formulated in terms of the Einstein-Hilbert-York-Gibbons-Hawking action, which requires suitable subtractions to produce the correct black hole partition function. However, there is a unique, canonical teleparallel reformulation which reproduces the same results without subtractions or other ambiguities. This is verified in the case of a black hole with or without an electric or a magnetic charge and in a background with or without a cosmological constant. Moreover, a new quasilocal prescription is proposed and tested, where the black hole partition function is determined solely by the horizon boundary term, yielding the correct Helmholtz free energy without the need for counterterms.

Result: Multiple solution types discovered, including cosmological constant-driven acceleration, isotropic/anisotropic expansion, Minkowski, and Kasner-like compactifications with splitting behaviors analogous to higher-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into Bianchi I dynamics under Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, revealing diverse solution classes that could inform cosmological models and quantum gravity research

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Bianchi I spacetimes within the framework of the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory. The field equations are formulated using dimensionless variables, and the asymptotic dynamics are studied through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes.

Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a quantum black hole whose exterior is described, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static $q$-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. Counting near horizon quasinormal modes shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

Abstract: We construct a position-space cosmological perturbation theory around spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker geometries that allows to model localized primordial sources of gravitational waves. The equations of motion are decoupled using a generalized harmonic gauge, which avoids the use of a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We point out that sources cannot generically be defined in a compact domain due to fluctuations of the cosmic perfect fluid. For power law cosmologies, we obtain the exact Green's function necessary to solve for all metric perturbations in terms of a hypergeometric function, which matches with a Green's function derived earlier by Chu. This allows us to derive the closed form expression of the linearized metric perturbation generated by sources up to quadrupolar order in the multipolar expansion.

Abstract: We study a thick brane scenario within the Palatini formulation of gravity, where the metric and affine connection are treated as independent variables. By introducing a non-minimal coupling between a bulk scalar field and the Ricci scalar, we obtain analytic solutions under a flat, four-dimensional Poincaré-invariant metric with a kink-like scalar configuration. The warp factor exhibits a bell-shaped profile, while the scalar potential forms a symmetric volcano-like structure, characteristic of a finite-thickness brane. The corresponding energy density is regular and localized, featuring a central peak with symmetrically placed negative minima. Through the analysis of linear tensor perturbations, we derive a Schrödinger-like equation with supersymmetric factorization, ensuring the absence of tachyonic modes and thus the stability of the background configuration. The effective potential also takes a volcano-like form that supports a localized graviton zero mode, confirming the recovery of four-dimensional gravity on the brane. A numerical study of the massive Kaluza--Klein spectrum reveals the progressive delocalization of massive modes into the bulk.
  Our results demonstrate a stable and physically consistent thick brane configuration within the Palatini gravity framework, offering new insights into gravity localization and braneworld phenomenology.

Abstract: An important step in using observations of gravitational waves from bounded sources is to relate the observed waveforms far away from a source to the local dynamics and environment of the source. To isolate and identify different features of the source, multipole expansion of radiation field as well as that of the source distribution is crucial. Unlike the waves on Minkowski background, those on de Sitter background do not have a convenient, close form relation among these multipoles of arbitrary order to draw general conclusions. This requires truncation to some multipole order to be employed and a consistency issue arises. This was flagged in \cite{CHK} as emergence of disallowed $log(r)$ terms in certain asymptotic forms and a particular quadrupolar truncation was proposed which was consistent with the source conservation.
  In \cite{NKD80}, it was noticed that a truncated solution while satisfying the wave equation, may fail to satisfy the gauge condition. Truncation in a fully gauge fixed form should not generate the unwanted $log(r)$ terms. In this work, we clarify the consistency issue and also correct a couple of erroneous statements in \cite{NKD80}. The consistency is analyzed by explicitly integrating the gauge conditions and the source conservation equations over the conformal time. This gives a general procedure for a consistent truncation. The procedure is applied to truncations of completely gauge fixed solution illustrating its consistency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the limitations of the standard textbook formulation of quantum mechanics and explore a more suitable approach for understanding quantum systems in the context of unifying quantum theory with gravity.

Method: The paper compares the standard textbook formulation of quantum mechanics with the Feynman Sum Over Histories approach, emphasizing their conceptual similarities with General Relativity.

Result: The paper suggests that the Feynman Sum Over Histories provides a more coherent framework for understanding events in quantum systems when considering quantum gravity.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that while the standard approach is successful in many practical applications, the Feynman Sum Over Histories offers a promising alternative for theoretical unification of quantum mechanics and gravity.

Abstract: Where does what happens happen in a quantum system? The standard textbook formulation of quantum mechanics provides a strange, imprecise and yet successful-in-practice answer to this question. In the struggle to unify our understanding of gravity with quantum theory, though, the textbook answer no longer suffices, and an alternative approach is needed. The Feynman Sum Over Histories approach provides an alternative that is particularly suited to quantum gravity because the Sum Over Histories and General Relativity are built on the same fundamental concepts of `event' and `history'.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Due to the non-renormalizability of continuum gravity, the perturbative expansion makes sense, say, for its discrete simplicial (Regge calculus) version. The finite-difference form of the gravity action has diffeomorphism symmetry at leading order over metric variations from site to site, and we add a term bilinear in $n^λ( g_{λμ} - g_{λμ}^{(0 ) } )$, $n^λ= [ 1, - \varepsilon ( Δ^{(s ) α} Δ^{(s ) }_α)^{- 1} Δ^{(s ) β} ]$, to "softly" fix the synchronous gauge $g_{0 λ} = g_{0 λ}^{(0 ) } = - δ_{0 λ}$ at $\varepsilon \to 0$, thereby resolving singularities at $p_0 = 0$.
  For the symmetric form of the derivative $Δ^{(s ) }_λ$, the propagator has a graviton pole at $p_0$ close to 0 or $\pm π$ at small $p_α$. This pole doubling compared to the continuum case is removed by using the action $\check{S}_{\rm g}$ with the usual derivative $Δ_λ= \exp ( i p_λ) - 1$ instead of $Δ^{(s ) }_λ= i \sin p_λ$ in some terms, including in the $k$ part of some term, and $Δ^{(s ) }_λ$ in the $1 - k$ part of that term.
  Given the propagator $\check{G} ( n, \overline{n} )$, we form the principal value type propagator $\frac{1}{2} [ \check{G} ( n, n ) + \check{G} ( \overline{n}, \overline{n} ) ]$ by analytically continuing from real $n$. Singularities are roughly resolved as $p_0^{-j} \Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i \varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$.
  We find that it is $k = 1$ that provides this prescription to properly work and match the continuum case. The gauge-fixing term required for this propagator and its finiteness are considered; the ghost contribution is found to vanish at $\varepsilon \to 0$. The results are used for the diagram technique in our recent paper. The calculations are illustrated by the electromagnetic (Yang-Mills) case.

Abstract: The light deflection under a strong gravitational field, referred to as strong gravitational lensing, provides a powerful probe of spacetime geometry. Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere. This work provides a wave-optics perspective on the interaction between dynamic sources and black holes, offering a table top window on strong gravitational lensing.

Abstract: The increasing scope and breadth of gravitational wave detectors is providing the opportunity to explore new parameters in gravitational-wave astronomy. Eccentricity and spin-precession are two key observables to infer the origin of a gravitational wave (GW) source. The interpretation of GW source parameters can be plagued by degeneracy, such as the well-known degeneracy between mass and spin. As the field has explored new parameters, questions have been raised about possible degeneracies between eccentricity and spin-precession. Although some state-of-the-art models now include these effects individually, models that incorporate spin-precession and eccentricity are only in their infancy. Until models faithfully cover the complete parameter space of compact binary coalescence, our ability to correctly measure the source parameters and infer the formation of the binary is compromised. Here, we present a study of the distinguishability of these two key parameters. Our work finds that there is indeed a degeneracy between eccentricity and spin-precession; however, it is a highly localized effect. We find that the misidentified eccentricity estimates get worse as the signal gets shorter. Additionally, this misidentification is highly sensitive to the inclination angle of the source system. We provide quantifiable estimates of the potency of this degeneracy in addition to identifying some of the regions of parameter space where this degeneracy exists.

TL;DR: The paper establishes a no-short-hair theorem for static spherically symmetric black holes in general relativity, showing that any hair present must extend beyond the photon sphere. The theorem is extended to extra-dimensional scenarios in post-Einstein gravity, suggesting potential observable methods to detect extra dimensions. Additionally, the applicability of the theorem to quantum gravity theories like string theory is discussed, where extra dimensions are naturally absent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on extensions of the no-short-hair theorem to various gravity theories and extra-dimensional models, providing a framework for understanding black hole properties in different theoretical contexts and their implications for observational physics.

Method: Mathematical analysis and theoretical derivations are employed to generalize the theorem across different spacetime dimensions and gravity theories, establishing constraints on black hole solutions under specific conditions.

Result: The generalized no-short-hair theorem imposes limitations on the structure of black holes in extra-dimensional and string theory contexts, offering observable signatures for these theories through potential black hole hair analysis.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the understanding of black hole uniqueness in diverse gravity theories and propose observable tests for extra-dimensional theories such as string theory by analyzing deviations from the no-short-hair theorem.

Abstract: The no-short hair theorem for static spherically symmetric black holes in general theory of relativity asserts that if a black hole has hair, that hair must extend beyond the lowest photon sphere radius of the black hole. This report generalizes the theorem to various extra-dimensional cases of black holes and wormholes in post-Einstein gravity and shows how the observational satisfaction of the no-short hair theorem may lead to a probe for the existence of extra-dimensions. We also show how we may lead to argue that this no-short hair theorem is satisfied for black holes in theories of quantum gravity that naturally precludes extra-dimensional cases, like string theory.

Motivation: Gravitational-wave astronomy has advanced significantly with the development of efficient Bayesian inference techniques. There is a growing need to perform rapid and accurate parameter estimation for binary black hole mergers to enable model comparisons and detect new astrophysical phenomena.

Method: SHARPy integrates SMC methods, which are well-suited for evidence estimation and parallel computation, with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm known for its efficiency in exploring high-dimensional parameter spaces. By leveraging the geometric structure of the posterior distribution and GPU acceleration, SHARPy enhances computational efficiency.

Result: The implementation of SHARPy on JAX and GPUs allows for the analysis of binary black-hole events in approximately ten minutes. This is a significant improvement over traditional methods like Nested Sampling, as it provides posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling.

Conclusion: SHARPy represents a substantial advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis, offering a computationally efficient and accurate framework for Bayesian inference. This tool paves the way for rapid follow-up observations and model comparison tasks in gravitational-wave astronomy.

Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently been applied to gravitational-wave inference as a powerful alternative to standard sampling techniques, such as Nested Sampling. At the same time, gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, most notably the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), provide an efficient way to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work we present SHARPy, a Bayesian inference framework that combines the parallelism and evidence-estimation capabilities of SMC with the state-of-the-art sampling performance of NUTS. Moreover, SHARPy exploits the local geometric structure of the posterior to further improve efficiency. Built on JAX and accelerated on GPUs, SHARPy performs gravitational-wave inference on binary black-hole events in around ten minutes, yielding posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates that are consistent with those obtained through Nested Sampling. This work sets a new milestone in GW inference with likelihood-based methods and paves the way for model comparison tasks to be accomplished in minutes.

Conclusion: 更高阶相互作用可以通过调节相互作用机制和振荡器动力学来显著影响Chimera状态的出现、强化或抑制其稳定性。

Abstract: How higher-order interactions influence dynamical behavior in networks of coupled chaotic oscillators remains an open question. To address this, we investigate emergent dynamical behaviors in a wheel network of Rössler and Lorenz oscillators that incorporates both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions under three coupling schemes, namely, diffusive, conjugate, and mean-field diffusive coupling. Our numerical analysis reveals four distinct collective behaviors: synchronization, desynchronization, chimera states, and synchronized clusters. To systematically classify these dynamical behaviors, we introduce two statistical measures that effectively capture synchronization patterns among arbitrarily positioned nodes. Applying these measures across all dynamical models and coupling schemes (six different models in total), we show that both pairwise and higher-order interactions crucially influence the emergence and robustness of chimera states. We observe that under pairwise interaction alone, chimera states appear with high prevalence in specific coupling ranges, though the robustness depends on both the coupling scheme and the underlying dynamical system. Incorporation of higher-order interactions reveals that the higher-order interaction underlying diffusive coupling enhances chimera states in both Rössler and Lorenz networks; under conjugate coupling, it strengthens chimera states in Lorenz but instead promotes full synchronization in Rössler; and under mean-field diffusive coupling, higher-order interactions generally favor synchronization, particularly for Rössler oscillators, but promote chimera in the Lorenz system for the intermediate range of its strengths. Overall, our results demonstrate that higher-order interactions can significantly modulate, promote, or suppress chimera states depending on the coupling mechanism and oscillator dynamics.

Abstract: Unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) are the non-chaotic, dynamical building blocks of spatio-temporal chaos, motivating a first-principles based theory for turbulence ever since the discovery of deterministic chaos. Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding.

Abstract: Traditional cellular force-sensing techniques, such as traction force microscopy (TFM), are predominantly limited to measuring linear tractions, overlooking and technically unable to capture the nanoscale torsional forces that are critical in cell-matrix interactions. Here, we introduce a nanodiamond-enabled torsion microscopy (DTM) that integrates nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers as orientation markers with micropillar arrays to decouple and quantify nanoscale rotational and translational motions induced by cells. This approach achieves high precision (~1.47 degree rotational accuracy and ~3.13*10-15 Nm torque sensitivity), enabling reconstruction of cellular torsional force fields and twisting energy distributions previously underestimated. Our findings reveal the widespread presence of torsional forces in cell-matrix interactions, introducing "cellular mechanical modes" where different adhesion patterns dictate the balance between traction- and torque- mediated mechanical energy transferred to the substrate. Notably, in immune cells like macrophages that generally exert low linear tractions, torque overwhelmingly dominates traction, highlighting a unique mechanical output for specific cellular functions. By uncovering these differential modes, DTM provides a versatile tool to advance biomechanical investigations, with potential applications in disease diagnostics and therapeutics.

Abstract: Biological electron transfer (ET) relies on quantum mechanical tunnelling through a dynamically folded protein. Yet, the spatiotemporal coupling between structural fluctuations and electron flux remains poorly understood, largely due to limitations in existing experimental techniques, such as ensemble averaging and non-physiological operating conditions. Here, we introduce a quantum tunnelling-integrated optoplasmonic nanotrap (QTOP-trap), an optoelectronic platform that combines plasmonic optical trapping with real-time quantum tunnelling measurements. This label-free approach enables single-molecule resolution of protein conductance in physiological electrolytes, achieving sub-3 nm spatial precision and 10-μs temporal resolution. By synchronising optoelectronic measurements, QTOP-trap resolves protein-specific conductance signatures and directly correlates tertiary structure dynamics with conductance using a "protein switch" strategy. This methodology establishes a universal framework for dissecting non-equilibrium ET mechanisms in individual conformational-active proteins, with broad implications for bioenergetics research and biomimetic quantum device design.

Abstract: Single molecule spectroscopy (SMS) revealed unusually large gap between two major exciton peaks of the B850 unit of light harvesting complex 2 (LH2), which could be explained assuming elliptic distortion or k=2 symmetry modulation in the site excitation energy. On the basis of extensive simulation of the SMS data and ensemble lineshape, we found that uniform modulation of k=2 symmetry cannot explain the dependence of intensity ratios on the gap of the two major peaks, which are available from SMS, nor the ensemble lineshape. Alternative models of disorder with k=1 and k=2 symmetry correlation are shown to reproduce these data reasonably well and can even explain the gap distribution when it is assumed that the lower major peak in the SMS lineshape is an intensity weighted average of k=1- and k=0 states.

Result: Automated, quantitative, non-destructive assessment of oocyte mechanical properties.

Conclusion: This system provides effective screening for oocyte quality in assisted reproductive technologies.

Abstract: The mechanical properties of oocytes are regarded as important indicators of their developmental potential. During fertilization, deviations from the normal mechanical range can hinder sperm penetration, ultimately reducing fertilization efficiency and compromising embryo quality. However, current methods for measuring oocyte mechanics often suffer from serious cellular damage, low automation levels, and large measurement errors. To address these limitations, we developed an AI-guided micronewton-scale mechanical measurement system for safe and automated oocyte quality assessment. The system integrates voice interaction with automated experimental workflows to control a magnetically actuated microgripper, which applies defined loading forces to induce micron-scale compressive deformation of the oocyte. Combined with AI-assisted object detection and image segmentation algorithms, the system captures cellular deformation in real time, enabling precise calculation of the oocyte's compressive modulus. This measurement system enables automated, quantitative, and non-destructive evaluation of oocyte mechanical properties, providing an effective approach for oocyte quality screening in in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART).

Abstract: Perturbations in moiré materials, such as due to substrates or strain, are common in many experiments and can significantly modify the electronic properties of the system. Here, we show that perturbations in twisted bilayer graphene tend to be transferred between the coupled Dirac cones, eventually reaching an equilibrium near the magic angle. We connect our results to experiments and show that this equilibrium behavior remains robust even when the moiré potential itself is perturbed. Our findings extend the notion of the magic angle to a more general regime governed by moiré-driven equilibrium.

TL;DR: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing, showing that particle-hole symmetry is preserved, Majorana modes occur with reciprocal localization pairs, and a topological phase diagram is constructed with bulk topology distinguishing phases.

Motivation: Understanding the behavior of non-Hermitian topological phases in the Kitaev chain is important for advancing the field of quantum matter and topological quantum phases.

Method: Analytical and numerical methods are used to investigate the model's symmetry structure, particle-hole symmetry preservation, Majorana mode occurrence, and bulk topology.

Result: Particle-hole symmetry is preserved, Majorana modes occur with reciprocal localization pairs, and a $	ext{Z}_2$ topological invariant distinguishes topological and trivial phases.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the interplay of non-Hermitian effects and topological phases in the Kitaev chain, highlighting Majorana mode behavior and topological phase transitions enabled by asymmetric pairing and non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes.

Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.

Abstract: We study ultrafast magneto-photocurrents in a three-dimensional topological insulator. For this purpose, we excite (In$_r$Bi$_{1-r}$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films with a femtosecond laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_{\text{ext}}$ up to 0.3 T parallel to the film plane. The resulting in-plane photocurrent is measured by detecting the emitted terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse. It scales linearly with $B_{\text{ext}}$ and is perpendicular to $B_{\text{ext}}$. Strikingly, for $r\ge$4%, we observe an abrupt photocurrent reduction, which is strongly correlated with the Indium-induced quenching of the topological surface states. The rise time, decay time and amplitude of the THz magneto-photocurrent can consistently be explained by a scenario in which optically excited spin-polarized electrons propagate toward the film surface where the accumulated spin is converted into an in-plane charge current due to spin-velocity locking. Our results are highly relevant for contact-free probing of spin-charge conversion in systems with paramagnetic rather than spontaneous magnetic order.

Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.

Abstract: Realizing Chern insulators with Chern numbers greater than one remains a major goal in quantum materials research. Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moiré unit cell when they are polarized away from the moiré interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the Středa trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance. Our experimental observations are supported by self-consistent mean-field calculations. Moreover, we realize both electrical and magnetic switching of the high-Chern-number states by flipping the valley polarization. Together, these results establish a tunable hierarchy of orbital Chern magnets in twisted rhombohedral graphene, offering systematic control of Chern number and topology through layer engineering in pristine graphene moiré systems.

Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.

Conclusion: This research opens up new possibilities for leveraging topologically protected bound states in the continuum in fault-tolerant quantum information processing and advanced electronic/photonic devices.

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum, originally proposed within the framework of quantum mechanics, have since been observed in a variety of physical contexts, including electromagnetism, acoustics, and optics. Of particular interest are those bound states in the continuum that are protected by continuous symmetries, as their stability makes them resistant to structural imperfections and material disorder. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of topologically protected bound states in the continuum by coupling a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain to a metallic lead. These states are characterized by distinct features in the electrical response of the system, serving as a direct indication of their topological origin. The inherent robustness of such topologically protected states highlights their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum information processing as well as in the design of advanced electronic and photonic devices.

Abstract: Ohm's law provides a fundamental framework for understanding charge transport in conductors and underpins the concept of electrical scaling that has enabled the continuous advancement of modern CMOS technologies. As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions. This work establishes a unified physical picture for understanding and optimizing disorder-driven electronic transport in low-dimensional transistors.

Abstract: Altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic materials, exhibit exotic chiral split magnons that are of great interest for both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. However, detecting and manipulating these magnons is challenging due to their THz frequency response. Here, we report the discovery of gapless chiral split magnons confined within altermagnetic domain walls. Unlike in conventional ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, their spectrum is highly sensitive to the domain wall orientation relative to the crystal axis. These magnons inherit the chiral splitting of their bulk counterparts and are detectable in the microwave regime, offering a distinctive signature for identifying altermagnets. We further show that the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives hybridization of magnons with opposite chiralities, enabling unidirectional strong magnon-magnon coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that spin-orbit torque can control the domain wall orientation, providing a practical means to manipulate these chiral magnons. Our findings open pathways for novel magnonic nanocircuitry based on altermagnetic domain walls.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates a method to create controlled spin-orbit torque patterns in tungsten thin films using laser annealing, achieving magnetization switching without external magnetic fields by leveraging microstructures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spintronics aims to use spin-orbit torques for magnetization switching without external fields, but achieving this requires precise control over the microstructure of ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices. This paper explores a new method to create such control.

Method: The researchers used direct-write laser annealing to pattern spin-orbit torque in tungsten thin films. They observed the transformation of the tungsten phase from the β phase to the α phase with increasing laser fluence. They also used transmission electron microscopy, resistivity measurements, and second harmonic generation to track the changes.

Result: The experiment successfully demonstrated that by creating gradients in the tungsten phase, they could form spin-orbit torque channels. When these tungsten wires were interfaced with CoFeB, the wires could switch their magnetization without an applied magnetic field, showing the potential for efficient spintronic devices.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for designing efficient spintronic devices by exploiting the microstructure of mixed-phase tungsten to control spin-orbit torque patterns.

Abstract: A key aim in spintronics is to achieve current-induced magnetization switching via spin-orbit torques without external magnetic fields. For this, the focus of recent work has been on introducing controlled lateral gradients across ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices, giving variations in thickness, composition, or interface quality. However, the small gradients achievable with common growth techniques limit both the impact of this approach and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $β$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $α$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices.

Abstract: Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit bright photoluminescence, a desirable property for light-emitting diodes and single-photon emitters. Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.

Abstract: Anomalous transports, including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), are typical manifestations of time-reversal-symmetry-breaking responses in materials. In general, the two Hall states with opposite Hall conductivities can be regarded as time-reversal pairs coupled to magnetic order, and switching between them relies on reversing the magnetization via an external magnetic field or electric current. Here, we introduce a approach for manipulating anomalous transport through crystal symmetry engineering in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems. Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that 2D altermagnets (AM) with out-of-plane Néel vectors will not host any anomalous Hall transport. Remarkably, breaking the symmetry connecting the two magnetic sublattices, an anomalous Hall response can emerge immediately, and the signs of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities can be flexibly controlled by the symmetry-breaking term, thereby realizing tunable sign-reversible anomalous transport. Furthermore, the feasibility of the theoretical scheme is further verified by explicit lattice-model construction. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the realization of crystal symmetry-controlled anomalous transport in a 2D AM material Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results indicate that Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$ with out-of-plane Néel vectors can sequentially exhibit the AHE and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) under continuous uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the sign reversal between these two effects can be achieved by simply rotating the strain direction by C$_{4z}$ symmetry. The corresponding ANE and its sign reversal are also revealed. Our findings provide a new strategy to manipulate anomalous transport, and should have significant potential applications.

Motivation: Understanding the real-time behavior of single molecule junctions is crucial for advancing nanoscale electronics and thermoelectric materials. The ability to measure both conductance and Seebeck coefficient simultaneously provides a powerful tool for studying these dynamic processes.

Method: The researchers employed a novel AC-based scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) break junction technique to simultaneously measure the conductance and Seebeck coefficient of oligo(phenylene ethynylene) molecular junctions. This method allows real-time observation of the junctions as they undergo structural changes.

Result: The key findings reveal that the junctions undergo significant structural reconfigurations, leading to notable changes in the Seebeck coefficient while the conductance remains nearly constant. These observations were corroborated by density functional theory and quantum transport simulations, which linked the observed changes to variations in contact geometry and charge transfer at the molecule-electrode interface.

Conclusion: The ability to simultaneously measure both conductance and Seebeck coefficient provides direct insight into the dynamic reconfiguration of single molecule junctions. These findings are significant for the design of thermoelectric molecular devices and for enhancing the stability of single molecule junctions.

Abstract: Single molecule junctions exhibit dynamic structural configurations that strongly influence their electronic and thermoelectric properties.

We show that most junctions undergo configuration changes that lead to notable changes in S while G remains nearly constant. Density functional theory and quantum transport simulations link these observations to variations in contact geometry and charge transfer at the molecule electrode interface. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous G and S measurements enable direct access to the dynamic reconfiguration of single molecule junctions and offer design insights for thermoelectric molecular devices and new routes for increasing single molecule junction stability.

Abstract: We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and precision of quantum dot simulators is crucial for advancing topological quantum computing, where Majorana modes are key components.

Method: The method involves training a deep vision-transformer network unsupervised on synthetic conductance maps of quantum dots. The model learns the relationship between Hamiltonian parameters and conductance patterns through a physics-informed loss function that considers Majorana zero mode properties.

Result: The model successfully memorizes the relationship between parameters and conductance maps, enabling it to propose effective parameter updates to induce Majorana modes with a single step. Iterative tuning using updated conductance maps allows the method to explore a wider parameter space, enhancing device optimization capabilities.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for automated optimization techniques in quantum materials research, particularly in achieving and stabilizing Majorana modes for potential topological qubit applications.

Abstract: We propose a neural network-based model capable of learning the broad landscape of working regimes in quantum dot simulators, and using this knowledge to autotune these devices - based on transport measurements - toward obtaining Majorana modes in the structure. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.

Abstract: The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions.
