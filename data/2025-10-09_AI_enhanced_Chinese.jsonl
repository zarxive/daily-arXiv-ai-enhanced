The theory can be understood as a formal framework that\nencompasses existing semiclassical methods: instanton theory and semiclassical\ntransition state theory (SCTST). Unlike SCTST, the present formalism does not\nstart from the concept of \"good\" action-angle variables. Instead, it is based\non a conjectured connection between the cumulative reaction probability and the\ninstanton contribution to the formally exact generalisation of Gutzwiller's\nformula for the trace of the Green's function. The formalism effectively\ngeneralises the \"imaginary free-energy\" formulation of instanton theory to\nmicrocanonical scattering rates and all orders in $\\hbar$. In one dimension,\nexplicit expressions are derived for the generalised reduced action up to\n$O(\\hbar^4)$ using exact WKB/quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The connection\nbetween the present formalism and the standard second order vibrational\nperturbation theory (VPT2) version of SCTST is explored. It is also shown that\nthe standard thermal instanton rate theory, as well as higher order (dividing\nsurface independent) \"perturbative\" corrections can be straightforwardly\nderived from the framework. Above the crossover temperature, first-order\ncorrections in $\\hbar$ to the parabolic barrier (\"sphaleron\") rate are also\nderived. A simple anharmonic transition state theory and anharmonic version of\nthe Wigner tunneling correction are presented.

This study\ndemonstrates the feasibility and potential of Fluidic Shaping as a method for\nmanufacturing optical components in space through two experiments performed\naboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Ax-1 mission.

This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN)\ncoefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time-\nand frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying\npotential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing\nformula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian\napproaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on\ndeviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most\nrecent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW\nphases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter\nspace with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\\odot}$, the optimal regime for\ntesting deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the\nstrength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and\nthe SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown\ncontributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between\ninspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these\ninspiral deviation parameters.

While some studies attribute\nit to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others\npropose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal\ndefects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and\nfractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are\nsignificant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant\nfor $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been\nattributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the\nacoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$\nhave Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon\npolarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall\nviscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively\naccounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Experiments on bivariate bicycle (BB) codes and their\ncoprime variants demonstrate that (i) both QuBA and SAGU consistently\noutperform the classical baseline belief propagation (BP), achieving a\nreduction of on average \\emph{one order of magnitude} in logical error rate\n(LER), and up to \\emph{two orders of magnitude} under confident-decision bounds\non the coprime BB code $[[154, 6, 16]]$; (ii) QuBA also surpasses\nstate-of-the-art neural decoders, providing an advantage of roughly \\emph{one\norder of magnitude} (e.g., for the larger BB code $[[756, 16, \\leq34]]$) even\nwhen considering conservative (safe) decision bounds; (iii) SAGU achieves\ndecoding performance comparable to or even outperforming QuBA's domain-specific\ntraining approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Although the detector is designed to be the most\nsensitive to GeV/$c^2$--TeV/$c^2$ Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs),\nit is also capable of measuring low-energy ionization signals down to a single\nelectron that may be produced by scatters of sub-GeV/$c^2$ dark matter. The\nmajor challenge in exploiting this sensitivity is to understand and suppress\nthe ionization background in the few-electron regime. We report a\ncharacterization of the delayed electron backgrounds following energy\ndepositions in the LZ detector under different detector conditions. In\naddition, we quantify the probability for photons to be emitted in coincidence\nwith electron emission from the high voltage grids. We then demonstrate that\nspontaneous grid electron emission can be identified and rejected with a high\nefficiency using a coincident photon tag, which provides a tool to improve the\nsensitivity of future dark matter searches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, most theoretical models are based on scalar theories (and\noccasionally coupled mode theories), which inadequately account for the\npolarization states of the incident light. To bridge this gap, we revisit the\nconcept of critical coupling in planar multilayer structures using a full\nvectorial theory, where conventional plane wave illumination is replaced by\nwell-defined vector beams with and without orbital angular momentum (OAM). Our\ninvestigation explores the possibility of complete absorption of monochromatic\nbeams without and with intrinsic OAM (such as Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian\n(LG)), incident on the multilayer structure at normal or oblique incidence. A\ntwo-component metal-dielectric composite film is chosen as the absorbing layer\nin the system. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in the\nintensities of the reflected and transmitted beams at normal incidence, with\nreduced efficiency for oblique incidence due to the lack of spatial overlap of\nmultiply reflected components. Interestingly, we also observe super-scattering\nfrom the same structures when conditions for constructive interference of the\nvarious reflected components are satisfied.

In both\nsystems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\\text{H}} = L_{0}=\n\\pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the\nHall Lorenz ratio $L_{\\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa_{\\mu\\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}$ divided by\ntemperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios\ndeviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a\nmagnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\\widetilde{L}$ and\n$\\widetilde{L}_{\\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the\nHall coefficient to their thermal counterparts.

In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting\nthe different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal\nresistivities in a magnetic field.

Conventional methods such as birefringent crystals,\nliquid crystals, or electro-optic Pockels cells are limited in speed,\ncompactness, and energy efficiency. While structured materials and\ntwo-dimensional heterostructures offer potential for on-chip ultrafast\nperformance, achieving all-optical control remains an open problem. Here we\nintroduce an all-optical scheme that employs femtosecond pumping of low-index,\nsubwavelength isotropic films to achieve ultrafast control over birefringence,\ndichroism, and optical activity within a single material platform. When the\nmaterial is probed near its crossover wavelength, linearly polarized pumping\ninduces a transient phase retardation up to 0.1{\\pi} per micrometer,\naccompanied by a dichroic absorption ratio of approximately twenty. Under\ncircularly polarized excitation, the probe experiences nonreciprocal optical\nactivity, leading to polarization rotation of about 1.1 degrees per micrometer.\nA universal hydrodynamic model quantitatively reproduces these effects and\nattributes them to pump-induced symmetry breaking in the photoexcited carrier\nplasma. This symmetry breaking enables coupling between orthogonal probe\npolarization components, mediated by a modified time-dependent damping term,\nwhich connects to the inverse Faraday effect induced by a circularly polarized\npump.

We find that increasing the mass of the field leads\nto a strong suppression of the damping rate, and extrapolation to larger masses\nindicates the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived oscillations, or\nquasi-resonances. In the time domain, the late-time decay follows an asymptotic\nbehavior that differs from the power-law tails of the classical Schwarzschild\ncase. Furthermore, we compute the grey-body factors and absorption\ncross-sections for the massive scalar field and show that the grey-body factors\ndecrease as the field mass increases, effectively shifting the emitted\nradiation spectrum toward higher frequencies.", "AI": {"tldr":

We answer this question in the\naffirmative for the ensemble of geometrically-2-local Hamiltonians with\nGaussian coefficients, evolved for constant time. This naturally leads to a\nquantum advantage scheme with clear prospects for experimental realization,\nnecessitating only course-grained control.\n  We give strong evidence of hardness for this physically-relevant ensemble. We\ndevelop the first worst-to-average-case reduction for approximating output\nprobabilities of (time-independent) geometrically-2-local Hamiltonian\nevolutions. Our reduction proceeds by nonstandard means: while we also leverage\npolynomial interpolation, unlike previous works, we reduce directly to an\nevaluator for the exact distribution over Hamiltonians, from which we are\ntrying to prove that sampling is hard. Previous works instead sampled from\nvarious perturbations of the true distribution, introducing additional\nconstraints meant to keep the perturbation, measured in total variation\ndistance, under control. We dispense with this step.\n  Our reduction consists in a robust multivariate polynomial interpolation,\nreduced to sequential robust univariate interpolations via the symmetries of\nthe Gaussian. We circumvent the fact that random Hamiltonians lack a hiding\nsymmetry, a key property in previous proofs. We also contribute an algorithmic\nversion of Berlekamp-Welch to deal with errored evaluations, solving an open\nproblem from the RCS literature.

From numerics, we find a\ndeterministic and exact unitary transposition protocol for $d=3$ with $7$\nqueries to $U$. This protocol improves upon the protocol shown in the previous\nwork, which requires $13$ queries to $U$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5c06\u672a\u77e5SU(d)\u95e8U\u4e0e\u5176\u9006\u6216\u8f6c\u7f6e\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728d=3\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u95e8\u9700\u89817\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u768413\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548cClebsch-Gordan\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e26\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86d=3\u65f6\u4e00\u79cd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u95e8\u8f6c\u7f6e\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ec5\u97007\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u768413\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5c06\u95e8\u4e0e\u5176\u9006\u6216\u8f6c\u7f6e\u8fde\u63a5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Our proof builds upon the compression theorem used in the proof of\nMIP*=RE, and we use the tracially embeddable strategies framework to show that\nthe same compression procedure in MIP* =RE also has the same desired property\nin the commuting operator setting. We also give a more streamlined proof of the\ncompression theorem for non-local games by incorporating the synchronous\nframework used by Mousavi et al.

The\ncovert (verifiable) learning model of Canetti and Karchmer (TCC 2021) provides\na framework for endowing classical learning algorithms with such guarantees. In\nthis work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning\ntheory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote\ndata access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We\nconsider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper\ndoes not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii)\ntarget-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the\nunknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making\nquantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for\nlearning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum\nstatistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning\nfrom public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for\nsolving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private\nclassical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d.\nancilla-free eavesdropper.

We present a universal approach that\nefficiently maps any polynomial-size superposition of occupation-number\nconfigurations to the first-quantized representation on a digital quantum\ncomputer. The method exploits the Jordan--Schwinger Lie algebra homomorphism,\nwhich identifies number-conserving second-quantized operators with their\nfirst-quantized action and induces an equivariant bijection between Fock\noccupations and $\\mathfrak{su}(d)$ weight states within the Schur--Weyl\ndecomposition.

Due to the enormous size of the design space,\nevaluating all possible configurations is typically infeasible.

The complete\nalgorithm is implemented and validated using classical quantum-circuit\nsimulations. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the method evaluates the\ncompliance of exponentially many structures in quantum superposition in\npolynomial time.

In the classical setting, replica exchange (or\nparallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these\nscenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a\nsimilar challenge, where bottlenecks can dramatically increase the mixing time\nof quantum dynamical semigroups. In this work, we introduce a quantum analogue\nof the replica exchange method. We define a Lindbladian on a joint system of\ntwo replicas and prove that it can accelerate mixing for a class of\nHamiltonians with local energy barriers.

Recently, such measurements have also been used in quantum\nalgorithms based on Regev's reduction. The key problem for these algorithms is\nthe S-LWE problem for lattice problems, or the Quantum Decoding Problem for\ncode problems. A key idea for addressing this problem is to use unambiguous\nmeasurements to recover $k$ coordinates of a code (or lattice) element $x$ from\na quantum state $|\\psi_x\\rangle$, which corresponds to a noisy word $x$ with\nerrors in quantum superposition. However, a general theoretical framework to\nanalyze this approach has been lacking.\n  In this work, we introduce the notion of fine-grained unambiguous\nmeasurements. Given a family of states\n$\\{\\,|\\psi_x\\rangle\\,\\}_{x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n}$, we ask whether there exist\nmeasurements that can return, with certainty, $k$ bits of information about\n$x$. We study this question in the setting of symmetric states, which naturally\narises in the Quantum Decoding Problem. We show that determining the maximal\nnumber of parities that a measurement can output can be formulated as a linear\nprogram, and we use its dual formulation to derive several upper bounds. In\nparticular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence\nof fine-grained unambiguous measurements and prove impossibility results\nshowing, in particular, that such measurements cannot improve upon the approach\nof arXiv:2310.20651.
