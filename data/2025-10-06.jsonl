However, these simulations are often computationally\nintensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting,\nparameter estimation, or real-time feedback.

Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in\nmilliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical\nsolvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened\nElectromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for\nRydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver\nfor resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nLSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a\nsurrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and\nfeedback-based optimisation."}

However, a key limitation of electro-optic combs is the restricted\nnumber of comb lines imposed by the available RF source power. To overcome this\nlimitation, a nonlinear spectral broadening stage is typically employed. The\nphase noise characteristics of an electro-optic comb are well described by the\nstandard phase noise model, which depends on two parameters: the seed laser and\nthe RF source phase noise. A fundamental question that arises is how nonlinear\nbroadening processes affect the phase noise properties of the expanded comb. To\naddress this, we employ coherent detection, digital signal processing, and\nsubspace tracking. Our experimental results show that the nonlinearly broadened\ncomb preserves the standard phase noise model of the input electro-optic comb.\nIn other words, the nonlinear processes neither introduce additional phase\nnoise terms nor amplify the existing contributions from the seed laser and RF\nsource. Hence, nonlinear broadening can be viewed as equivalent to driving the\nelectro-optic comb with a much higher RF modulation power."}

In all cases the large power\ndifference between classical and quantum channels presents challenges for such\nschemes, as the classical signals generate interfering noise that corrupts the\nquantum signal. In this work, we discuss the main interference mechanisms in\ncoexistence scenarios and provide a model to quantify their impact on the\nquantum signal quality. Analytical approximations in the model allow accurate\nand fast numerical solutions in the millisecond time-scale. The model accounts\nfor out-of-band non-linear interference effects, namely spontaneous Raman\nscattering (SpRS) and four-wave-mixing (FWM) in both cases of single-mode and\nSDM fibers with weakly-coupled degenerate mode groups. Rayleigh and SpRS\nbackscattering are considered in counter-propagating scenarios. Since broadband\nclassical transmission is targeted, the model also accounts for the effect of\nstimulated Raman scattering (SRS)-induced power tilt. Use of the model in\nsample scenarios indicates that the interference noise power is minimized at\nthe high end of the transmission band in both cases were the quantum is co- and\ncounter-propagating with respect to the classical signals, with a preference of\none or the other scheme depending on the link length and quantum signal center\nfrequency. Our model reveals that FWM has negligible impact in\ncounter-propagating schemes, but can be relevant in co-propagating schemes\nunder certain scenarios.

A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to\nany part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal\nlocal subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient\nclassical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an\noutstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key\ningredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the\nlocal basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by\nquantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot\nbe efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage\nin communication. We show this by giving a protocol for secure quantum\ncommunication that exploits this insight. Our work also has implications for\nthe quantum-classical border and we discuss how objectivity emerging out of\nDarwinism demarcates this border in three ways - empirical based on our\nobservations and experience of objectivity, information theoretic due to the\nabsence of any quantum correlations and lastly computational in the sense\ndiscussed above. Lastly, we show that the quantum-classical boundary as drawn\nby quantum Darwinism as well by what can be simulated efficiently in a mixed\nstate quantum computation aligns with the boundary given by Hardy"}

While multiple statistically\nsecure blind verification schemes in the prepare-and-send model have been\nproposed, none of them achieves full quantum fault-tolerance, a prerequisite\nfor useful verification on scalable quantum computers. In this paper, we\npresent the first fault-tolerant blind verification scheme for universal\nquantum computations able to handle secret-dependent noise on the verifier's\nquantum device. Composable security of the proposed protocol is proven in the\nAbstract Cryptography framework.\n  Our main tools are two novel distillation protocols that turn\nsecret-dependent noise into secret-independent noise. The first one is run by\nthe verifier and acts on its noisy gates, while the second and more complex one\nis run entirely on the prover's device and acts on states provided by the\nverifier. Both are required to overcome the leakage induced by secret-dependent\nnoise. We use these protocols to prepare states in the X-Y-plane whose noise is\noverwhelmingly secret-independent, which then allows us to verify with\nexponential confidence arbitrary fault-tolerant BQP computations."}

While previous\nwork has shown that Markovian evolution can generate entanglement and other\nnonclassical correlations in de Sitter backgrounds, the basis-dependent nature\nof coherence has so far limited its unambiguous interpretation. Here, we\nintroduce a basis-independent framework to quantify not only the total\ncoherence of two comoving detectors, but also its collective and localized\ncontributions, and we trace how each of these decomposed measures varies with\nthe inverse of Gibbons-Hawking temperature. By treating the detectors as open\nquantum systems interacting with a massless scalar field in the Bunch-Davies\nand squeezed alpha-vacua, we find that non-thermal squeezing substantially\nenhances extractable coherence, even under strong thermal effects. Our results\ndemonstrate how basis-independent coherence in de Sitter spacetime can serve as\na robust resource for relativistic quantum information protocols."}

However, these simulations are often computationally\nintensive, especially when repeated evaluations are required for data fitting,\nparameter estimation, or real-time feedback. To address this challenge, we\ndevelop a Long Short-Term Memory neural network capable of replicating the\noutput of these simulations with high accuracy and significantly reduced\ncomputational cost. Once trained, the surrogate model produces spectra in\nmilliseconds, providing a speed-up of 5000x relative to traditional numerical\nsolvers. We focus on applying this technique to Doppler-broadened\nElectromagnetically Induced Transparency in a ladder-type scheme for\nRydberg-based sensing, achieving near-unity agreement with the physics solver\nfor resonant and off-resonant regimes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nLSTM model on this representative optical quantum system, establishing it as a\nsurrogate tool capable of supporting real-time signal processing and\nfeedback-based optimisation."}

For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar\nfields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction\ncondition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be\ncontinuous at the node. We demonstrate that this new junction condition is\nconsistent with the variational principle and energy conservation. Furthermore,\nwe provide an exact realization of it in a real physical system. As an\napplication, we analyze the Casimir effect using both the traditional and the\nnew junction conditions in networks formed by regular polyhedra. Our results\nindicate that the new junction condition generally results in a smaller Casimir\neffect."}

We show that the\npolarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of\ntransitions.
