Nonlocal effects induce Yukawa screening, which shifts the event horizon inward and modifies both the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and the Hawking temperature, while also renormalizing the chemical potential. Nonlocal corrections also reduce the magnitude of the negative specific heat, making small hairy black holes more stable, with Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies consistent with the absence of first-order phase transitions. The nonlocal spin-2 propagator contains, in addition to the massless graviton, a massive pole with positive residue and positive norm. Consequently, hairy black holes in nonlocal quadratic gravity are free of ghost instabilities at the quadratic and classical levels, in the effective field theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To this end, we consider the model of collective search introduced in [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.102.012402], under a minimal setting with no olfactory information. Agents combine a private exploratory behavior and a social imitation consisting in aligning to their neighbors, and weigh the two contributions with a single ``trust\" parameter that controls their relative influence. We find that an optimal trust parameter exists even in the absence of olfactory information, as was observed in the original model. Optimality is dictated by the need to explore the minimal region of space that contains the target. An optimal trust parameter emerges from this constraint because it it tunes imitation, which induces a collective mechanism of inertia affecting the size and path of the swarm. We predict the optimal trust parameter for cohesive groups where all agents interact with one another.

However, all physical systems proposed to host this ground state, including Li$_2$IrO$_3$, Na$_2$IrO$_3$, and RuCl$_3$, develop magnetic order at low temperatures due to competing interactions. Nonetheless, theoretical modeling of experimental data has shown that Kitaev interactions are still present, motivating the application of perturbations such as pressure, magnetic field, and chemical doping to drive the system into the QSL phase. Here we study $\u03b2$-Li$_{2}$Ru$_{x}$Ir$_{1-x}$O$_{3}$ with dilute levels of Ru, $x \\lesssim 10\\%$. Through a combination of magnetometry, resonant elastic X-ray scattering, ac-heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation/resonance, we show that weak magnetic disorder suppresses long-range antiferromagnetic order and stabilizes an anisotropic spin glass that retains key signatures of Kitaev exchange. This Kitaev spin glass shows pronounced directional anisotropy in its magnetic susceptibility and thermoremenant magnetization. These results demonstrate that dilute magnetic disorder can access an anisotropic Kitaev spin glass: a proximate phase that freezes the Kitaev frustration landscape.

Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds.

Here we present GeoOpt-Net, a multi-branch SE(3)-equivariant geometry refinement network that predicts DFT-quality structures at the B3LYP/TZVP level of theory in a single forward pass starting from inexpensive initial conformers generated at a low-cost force-field level. GeoOpt-Net is trained using a two-stage strategy in which a broadly pretrained geometric representation is subsequently fine-tuned to approach B3LYP/TZVP-level accuracy, with theory- and basis-set-aware calibration enabled by a fidelity-aware feature modulation (FAFM) mechanism. Benchmarking against representative approaches spanning classical conformer generation (RDKit), semiempirical quantum methods (xTB), data-driven geometry refinement pipelines (Auto3D), and machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMA) on external drug-like molecules demonstrates that GeoOpt-Net achieves sub-milli-\u00c5 all-atom RMSD with near-zero B3LYP/TZVP single-point energy deviations, indicating DFT-ready geometries that closely reproduce both structural and energetic references. Beyond geometric metrics, GeoOpt-Net generates initial guesses intrinsically compatible with DFT convergence criteria, yielding nonzero ``All-YES'' convergence rates (65.0\\% under loose and 33.4\\% under default thresholds), and substantially reducing re-optimization steps and wall-clock time. GeoOpt-Net further exhibits smooth and predictable energy scaling with molecular complexity while preserving key electronic observables such as dipole moments.

Wing morphing is performed by Macro Fiber Composites (MFC) mini-piezoelectric actuators distributed along the span of the ''Reduced Scale'' (RS) A320 prototype of the H2020 No 723402 European research project SMS, ''Smart Morphing and Sensing for aeronautical configurations'', (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723402 and www.smartwing.org/SMS/EU). The configuration studied corresponds to a low-subsonic regime (Mach number 0.063) with a 10 degree incidence and a Reynolds number of 1 Million. The numerical simulations are carried out with the Navier-Stokes Multi-Block (NSMB) solver, which takes into account the deformation of the rear part of the wing implemented experimentally with the piezoelectric actuators. A detailed physical analysis of the morphing effects on the wake dynamics and on the aerodynamic performance is conducted with a constant amplitude of 0.7cm over a wide range of actuation frequencies [10-600]Hz. Optimal vibration ranges of [180-192]Hz and [205-215]Hz were found to respectively provide a 1% drag reduction and a 2% lift-to-drag ratio increase compared to the non-morphing (static) configuration. The natural frequencies associated with the shear layer Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) vortices and the Von-Karman (VK) vortex shedding were found to play a central role in the modification of the wake dynamics by morphing as well as in the increase of the aerodynamic performance. Actuating at (or close to) the upper shear layer (USL) natural frequency (~185Hz) provides an order of 1% drag reduction and 1% lift-to-drag ratio increase, while actuating at (or close to) the lower shear layer (LSL) natural frequency (~208Hz) provides an order of 8% lift increase and 2% lift-to-drag increase. Furthermore, the linear variation of the actuation frequency over time, called wobulation, was shown to have significant effects. This approach demonstrated, through an appropriate mapping, the ability to quickly and efficiently detect optimal constant actuation frequency ranges providing aerodynamic performance increase and simultaneously reducing the amplitude of the main instability modes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The remarkable consistency of the predicted and measured contact angles of liquids on some rough surfaces also confirm the validity of the approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u2014\u2014\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8868\u9762\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff08NSFE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u4f4e\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6db2\u4f53\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6bdb\u7ec6\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8868\u9762\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff08SFE\uff09\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8868\u9762\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\uff08NSFE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "NSFE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u503c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u8868\u9762\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u89d2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The spectrum emitted by the SLD exhibits a full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of $\\sim$80 nm centred near 2.1 $\u03bc\\mathrm{m}$. For OCT operation, stable amplified spontaneous emission with low spectral ripple ($<20\\%$) is maintained at drive currents below 150 mA. The SLD is fiber coupled and integrated into a fiber-based Michelson interferometer. In the OCT system, the measured coherence envelope yields an axial resolution of approximately 300 $\u03bc$m in air and enables depth-resolved imaging of scattering paint-based coating samples. In contrast to OCT implementations at 2 $\u03bc\\mathrm{m}$ wavelength region that commonly rely on supercontinuum sources, the use of GaSb-based SLDs offers a compact practical alternative, leveraging the maturity and scalability of electrically driven semiconductor light sources packaged in a standard \"butterfly\" module.

Classical features are extracted and reduced via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enable efficient quantum encoding. The reduced feature vectors are embedded into a quantum kernel-induced feature space using a fully entangled ZZFeatureMap and classified using a kernel based QSVM. Performance is first evaluated on a quantum simulator and subsequently validated on NISQ-era superconducting quantum hardware, specifically the IBM Torino (133-qubit) and IBM Fez (156-qubit) processors. Experimental results demonstrate that the QSVM achieves competitive classification performance relative to classical SVM baselines while operating on substantially reduced feature dimensionality. Hardware experiments reveal the impact of noise and decoherence and measurement shot count on quantum kernel estimation, and further show improved stability and fidelity on newer Heron r2 architecture. This study provides a systematic comparison between simulator-based and hardware-based QSVM implementations and highlights both the feasibility and current limitations of deploying quantum kernel methods for practical radar signal classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Consequently, under standard semiclassical holographic assumptions, even determining which smooth spacetime geometry emerges from quantum gravity can be beyond the limits of computability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u8fc7AdS/CFT\u5bf9\u5076\u88ab holographically \u8f6c\u4f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528AdS/CFT\u5bf9\u5076\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u5176\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff0c\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u80fd\u9699\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u5176\u5f15\u529b\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e3b\u978d\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5224\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u88ab\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5076\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002"}}

However, due to nutrient depletion, mechanical constraints, or other limitations, exponential proliferation is not indefinite, and the spreading slows. Here, we theoretically explore a fundamental question: is it possible to infer the dominant limitation type from the spreading dynamics? Using a continuum active fluid model, we consider three limitations to cell proliferation: intrinsic growth arrest (e.g., due to sporulation), pressure from other cells, and nutrient access. We find that memoryless growth arrest still results in superlinear (accelerating) spreading, but at a reduced rate. In contrast, pressure-limited growth results in linear (constant-speed) spreading in the long-time limit. We characterize how the expansion speed depends on the maximum growth rate, the limiting pressure value, and the effective fluid friction. Interestingly, nutrient-limited growth results in a phase transition: depending on the nutrient supply and how efficiently nutrient is converted to biomass, the spreading can be either superlinear or sublinear (decelerating). We predict the phase boundary in terms of these parameters and confirm with simulations. Thus, our results suggest that when an expansion slowdown is observed, its dominant cause is likely nutrient depletion. More generally, our work suggests that cell-level growth limitations can be inferred from population-level dynamics, and it offers a methodology for connecting these two scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses how different cell proliferation limitations affect the spreading of a microbial community.

We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\u039b$CDM by the combined data.

Calorimeter cell designs featuring a compact heater and thermometer arranged in a sidecar geometry, with the sample positioned directly above the heater at the center of a silicon nitride membrane, are presented. High-yield, wafer-level batch fabrication of precision calorimetric sensor chips, beamline and laboratory cryostat plugins with sensor mounting and packaging are described. Using our calorimetric sensors, we present specific heat measurements on samples with masses ranging from 4 \u03bcg to 145 \u03bcg. The sample and reference cells are characterized with relaxation and ac steady-state measurements. The thermal response is captured using lock-in detection at carefully optimized measurement frequencies, with phase-lag correction ensuring precise extraction of heat capacity. The reference cell's background heat capacity was measured to be under 320 nJ/K at 300 K, decreasing to just 0.4 nJ/K at 0.7 K. The calorimeter performance is illustrated by studying the specific heat of small samples of superconducting Nb and a 4 \u03bcg piece of superconducting Al under different magnetic field strengths.

However, the physical nature of this interaction has remained elusive. In the present study, we show that the stabilizing mechanism is entirely encoded in the quantum correlations between the two positrons and, to a lesser extent, in the electron-positron correlations. Notably, the interaction cannot be recovered at the mean-field (Hartree-Fock) level, nor by computational models that include only electron-electron correlation effects. Accordingly, the bond formed between PsH units, termed here a two-positron gluonic bond to emphasize its fundamentally distinct character from the two-positron covalent bonds present in pure antimatter molecules, emerges only when matter and antimatter particles form a common bound state. When classified within the framework of known bonding mechanisms, this gluonic bond falls into the category of stabilizing dispersion interactions, giving rise to a van der Waals complex. However, its remarkably large bond dissociation energy, compared with those of strongly bonded van der Waals complexes of similar size, reveals an anomalously strong interaction.

Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models.

Here, we study a simple dynamical model of a microbial community in which species interact by competing for the uptake of common metabolites that are leaked by other species. The model includes coupled dynamics of species populations and chemical concentrations in the medium, allowing for a variety of uptake and leakage networks among species. Depending on the structure of these networks, the system exhibits different attractors, including fixed points, limit cycles, low-dimensional chaos, and high-dimensional chaos. In the fixed-point and limit-cycle cases, the number of coexisting species is bounded by the number of exchangeable chemicals, consistent with the well-known competitive exclusion principle. In contrast, in the low-dimensional chaotic regime, the number of coexisting species exhibits noticeable but limited excess over this limit. Remarkably, in the high-dimensional chaotic regime, a much larger number of species beyond this limit coexist persistently over time. In this case, the rank-abundance distribution is broader than exponential, as often observed in real ecosystems. The population dynamics displays intermittent switching among quasi-stationary states, while the chemical dynamics explore most of the high dimensions. We find that such high-dimensional chaos is ubiquitous when the number of uptake chemicals is moderately larger than the number of leaked chemicals. Our results identify high-dimensional chaos with intermittent switching as a generic dynamical mechanism that stabilizes coexistence in interacting systems.

In the spin degenerate, spin orbit free limit, the reduced Brillouin zone contains flat, spin degenerate moire minibands, with periodicity determined by superlattice folding. The inclusion of spin orbit interaction lifts the spin degeneracy and reduces the effective spectral periodicity by a factor of two. Through spin orbit interaction, the moire potential entangles spin, sublattice, and leg degrees of freedom, reshaping the miniband structure in momentum space and generating emergent helicity spectral functions.

Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths.

Recently, there has been growing interest in plasmons for applications in quantum information processing. Electrons floating on liquid helium provide an exceptionally clean, disorder-free system and have emerged as a promising platform for this purpose. In this work, we establish this system as a tunable plasmon-photon hybrid platform. We demonstrate strong coupling between floating-electron plasmons and radio-frequency (RF) photons confined in an LC resonator. Time-resolved measurements reveal coherent oscillatory energy exchange between the plasmonic and photonic modes, providing direct evidence of their coherent coupling. These results represent a step towards cavity quantum electrodynamics with a floating-electron plasmon coupled to a resonator. Furthermore, the LC resonator serves as a sensitive probe of electron-on-helium physics, enabling the observation of the Wigner crystal transition and a quantitative study of the temperature-dependent plasmon decay arising from ripplon-induced scattering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u6d6e\u5728\u6db2\u6c26\u4e0a\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u4ecb\u5171\u632f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ecb\u5171\u632f\u548c\u4ecb\u632f\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5076\u8054\uff0c\u9690\u85cf\u4e86\u6db2\u6c26\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u4ecb\u5171\u632f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728 Clean \u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1LC\u632f\u8361\u5668\u9650\u5236RF\u5149\u5b50\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u6d4b\u91cf\u8868\u89c2\u4ecb\u632f\u5b50\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5076\u8054\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528LC\u632f\u8361\u5668\u89c2\u5bdf\u6db2\u6c26\u4e0a\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecb\u632f\u5b50\u4e0e\u5149\u5b50\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5076\u8054\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4ecb\u5171\u632f\u4e0e\u4ecb\u632f\u5b50\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5076\u8054\u8ff9\u8c61\uff1bLC\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a2\u6d4b\u6db2\u6c26\u4e0a\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86Wigner\u6676\u4f53\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4ecb\u632f\u5b50\u8870\u51cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Here, we presented an ingenious hexagonal nanowire (HNW)-based PSC that achieves broadband absorption, minimizes reflectance, and offers robust polarization insensitivity by improving light-matter interaction and increasing charge-collection efficiency. The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport. The optimized HNW structure achieved a notable power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, highlighting a strong connection between optical confinement and effective carrier transport. These attributes render the proposed HNW PSC a viable option for high-performance PV systems and scalable thin-film solar technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The magnon dispersion in a ferromagnet usually possesses an effective time reversal symmetry in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, preventing the appearance of topological magnons. When a spin system is coupled to itinerant electrons, we find that the magnon band structure of the spin system experiences time-reversal symmetry breaking with the electron-magnon interaction via the exchange coupling, where topological magnons arise without requiring strong DM. Specifically, we consider a heterostructure consisting of a ferromagnetic insulator and a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer and investigate topological gap opening in magnon bands. Our findings reveal that even trivial ferromagnets can host topological magnons via coupling to itinerant electronic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50-\u78c1\u5b50\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u666e\u901a\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e5f\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u8865\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7535\u5b50-\u78c1\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u78c1\u6027\u6001\u7684\u62d3\u8865\u7279\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u4e0eTMD\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6742\u5806\u7ed3\u6784\uff09", "result": "\u62d3\u8865\u78c1\u5b50\u6001\u5728\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0", "conclusion": "\u78c1\u5b50-\u7535\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u662f\u5f15\u53d1\u78c1\u6027\u62d3\u8865\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84"}}

Magnetic stability and control are achieved through a combination of passive shielding, provided by a magnetically shielded room (MSR), and a surrounding active field compensation system by an Active Magnetic Shield (AMS). The AMS is a feedback-controlled system of eight coils spanned on an irregular grid, designed to provide magnetic stability to the enclosed volume by actively suppressing external magnetic disturbances. It can compensate static and variable magnetic fields up to $\\pm 50$ $\u03bc$T (homogeneous components) and $\\pm 5$ $\u03bc$T/m (first-order gradients), suppressing them to a few $\u03bc$T in the sub-Hertz frequency range.

Here, we show that this expectation fails for intrinsically discrete systems. Using the microscopic scattering approach, we study the Casimir-Polder interaction between two atomic arrays, and uncover an unconventional distance scaling in which the force crosses over from a faster decay at short separations to a slower decay in the retarded regime. This behavior originates from the discrete lattice structure and can be consistently understood within the scattering picture.

Ab-initio calculations, which explicitly take into account coupled electron-nuclear dynamics induced by the pump and the multiphoton nature of the probe-induced ionization step, reproduced the observed delay in the yield. It originates from resonant enhancement of the multiphoton ionization of the electronically excited ethylene cation as the carbon-carbon double bond expands. However, this effect is tempered by rapid nonadiabatic relaxation of the excited ionic states. Our results suggest a general mechanism whereby ultrafast nonadiabatic relaxation of a molecular ion can compete with its strong-field ionization rate, confining the dication yield to a narrow temporal window of a few femtoseconds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8d85\u77ed\u6781\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u548c\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e59\u70ef\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728\u8109\u51b2\u95f4\u9694\u7ea615 fs\u65f6\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u79bb\u5b50\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6838\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u662f\u7531 electronically excited \u7684\u4e59\u70ef\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u79bb\u89e3\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u53cc\u952e\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u800c\u51fa\u73b0\u5171\u632f\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u53d7\u5230\u5feb\u901f\u975e\u7edd boiling \u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6001\u5feb\u901f\u964d\u89e3\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u5b50\u79bb\u5b50\u5feb\u901f\u975e\u7edd\u6cb8\u6001\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5f3a\u573a\u79bb\u89e3\u901f\u7387\u53d1\u751f\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u98de\u79d2\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u53ca\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53d7\u6fc0\u53d1\u79bb\u89e3\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u5b50\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8d85\u77ed\u6781\u7d2b\u5916\u5149\u548c\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8109\u51b2\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u68c0\u6d4bethylene\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u5cf0\u503c\u51fa\u73b0\u572815 fs\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u95f4\u9694\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53cc\u6b63\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a-\u5f31\u573a\u79bb\u89e3\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We report single-shot interferometric measurements of spontaneous vortex nucleation in a room-temperature organic exciton-polariton condensate. From hundreds of independent realizations we find random vortex-core positions and unbiased circulation, consistent with intrinsically stochastic, unpinned defect formation. The mean vortex number scales with pump power above threshold with an exponent consistent with Kibble-Zurek freeze-out in a driven-dissipative condensate. Using reconstructed phase maps we obtain single-shot flow fields, compute the incompressible component, and extract kinetic-energy spectra. Vortex-containing realizations develop a robust Kolmogorov-like segment with Einc(k) proportional to k^(-5/3) over a finite k range, indicating the onset of turbulent spectral scaling in a quantum fluid of light. These results establish single-shot access to phase and flow as a direct route to quantifying stochastic defect formation and emerging turbulence in polariton condensates.", "AI": {"tldr":

To ensure robustness across practical experimental regimes, we combine two complementary solvers: (i) a local $O(L^2)$ closure that is accurate when eikonal shifts remain sub-pixel, and (ii) a non-local formulation for multi-pixel shifts, in which intensity is propagated through an explicit eikonal ray mapping using a mass-conserving bilinear redisribution on the detector grid, and detector residuals are transferred back to the object grid by the corresponding adjoint (transpose), implemented as bilinear interpolation, before applying an approximate FFT-diagonal preconditioner to accelerate convergence. The same framework supports polychromatic data through a compact spectral discretisation, allowing energy-dependent transport and inversion while keeping the iteration GPU/FFT efficient.

These experiments, operated as cryogenic calorimeters at $\\sim$10 mK, are usually read out by high-impedance neutron transmutation doped (NTD) thermistors, which provide good energy resolution, but are limited by $\\sim$1 ms response times. Superconducting detectors, such as transition-edge sensors (TESs) with a time resolution of $\\sim$100 $\u03bc$s, offer superior timing performance over NTD semiconductor bolometers. To make this technology viable for an application to a thousand or more channels, multiplexed readout is necessary in order to minimize the thermal load and radioactive contamination induced by the readout. Frequency-domain multiplexing readout (fMux) for TESs, previously developed at Berkeley Lab and McGill University, is currently in use for mm-wave telescopes with detector sampling rates in the order of 100 Hz.

Starting from the gauge-fixed graviton path integral on $S^D$, we trace the one-loop phase $\\ii^{D+2}$ to a finite set of scalar and conformal Killing modes and show that, once the worldline is included, the $(D-1)$ transverse negative modes cancel the corresponding $(D-1)$ conformal Killing directions mode by mode. The residual fixed-$\u03b2$ phase from the global conformal factor and reparametrizations is removed by imposing the Hamiltonian constraint $H_{\\text{patch}} - H_{\\text{clock}} - \u03bd= 0$ via a Bromwich inverse Laplace transform, which under explicit complete-monotonicity assumptions yields a real and positive microcanonical density. We stress that this positivity statement is conditional on Assumptions (A1)--(A3) and is established at one loop about the round $S^D$ saddle in the probe regime $G E_{\\rm clock}/R\\ll 1$; a self-consistent backreacting or higher-loop extension is a natural next step. In earlier work \\cite{Ali:2025wld,Ali:2024rnw} we argued that unbroken SU(3) confinement at $T\\to 0$ can account for the observed value of the cosmological constant and for the origin of the fundamental constants $(\\hbar,G,c)$ as effective couplings fixed by the SU(3) vacuum structure; this makes SU(3) the natural candidate for the internal clock of de~Sitter, whose radius and temperature are themselves set by the same cosmological constant. This idea is implemented with three explicit SU(3) realizations (qutrit, Cartan weight-lattice, and $U(1)^2$ rotor), for which the observer-inclusive density of states factorizes into a universal gravity factor, a universal worldline residue, and a clock-dependent SU(3) weight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In the isotropic case ($\u0394=1$), CMFT results reveal an intermediate empty plaquette (EP) phase that has a lower energy than the full plaquette (FP) phase. However, due to mean-field artifacts, CMFT alone is not suitable for accurately determining phase boundaries. Therefore, we combined three methods to map out the reliable phase diagram. Our calculations show that the EP phase narrows as $\u0394$ deviates from unity and eventually vanishes. More importantly, we identify a spiral phase at small $\u0394$, which has not been reported in previous studies. This phase is clearly captured by DMRG simulations on long cylindrical geometries. The competition between the EP, spiral, and $xy$-AFM phases near their boundaries provides a plausible explanation for the emergent spin-liquid-like behavior in RE$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_2$, while shedding new light on the role of XXZ anisotropy in the Shastry-Sutherland XXZ model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba predicts \u4e8c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u67d0\u79cd\u71b5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u731c\u60f3\u89e3\u91ca\u6700\u7ec8\u6001\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e8c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6001 why \u662f\u975e\u7279arily formed, \u5173\u6ce8\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7 thermodynamic \u539f\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528 post-Newtonian approximation \u548c\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df between \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6784\u9020 entropy \u5173\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u5176\u6700\u5927\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0 final \u72b6\u6001 \u7684\u53c2\u6570 (\u5982 mass \u548c spin) \u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u51e0 percent \u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e entropy \u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e \u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d thermodynamic \u539f\u7406\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we present a unified variational framework that extends CIS by incorporating orbital optimization (state-specific and state-averaged), linear-response orbital relaxation via double-CIS schemes, and spin-symmetry breaking and restoration. In spin-projected state-averaged formulations, standard multistate parametrizations are no longer valid because the projection operator breaks the unitary invariance of orbital rotations and induces nonorthogonal couplings among states. By formulating a rigorous state-averaged objective in the projected subspace, we derive analytic gradients and Hessians and enable robust optimization using a trust-region augmented Hessian algorithm. Benchmark calculations show that spin projection alone significantly exacerbates the CIS overestimation in weakly correlated systems, whereas combining spin projection with state averaging or double-CI corrections substantially reduces errors, particularly for Rydberg excitations. We further demonstrate that state averaging and spin projection provide complementary and essential benefits in strongly correlated regimes, as illustrated by the bond dissociation of hydrogen fluoride.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86CIS\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f68\u9053\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u53ccCIS\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdbCIS\u5728\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f30\u7b97\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u5e72\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53ccCIS\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u6295\u5f71\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5267\u4e86CIS\u7684\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u6216\u53ccCIS\u4fee\u6b63\u53ef\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6c22\u6c1f\u5206\u5b50\u65ad\u88c2\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u9053\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86CIS\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u4f53\u7cfb excited\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u66f4\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

We develop a continuum model for the shrinking dynamics of antiskyrmions in bulk DMI systems, using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for the time derivative of the magnetization field. Owing to the structure of their azimuthal angle, or helicity, elliptic antiskyrmions are energetically favored over circular ones. To capture this feature, we parametrize the magnetization field with a triangular radial profile and an elliptic in-plane shape. This ansatz yields four coupled dynamical equations governing time evolution of the semi-axes, helicities, and rotation angles. In the absence of the DMI, circular antiskyrmions shrink isotropically, exhibiting a crossover from exponential decay to square-root collapse. Initially elliptic antiskyrmions are driven towards circularity. For finite DMI, the semi-axes dynamics couples to the helicity and rotation, where the theory predicts a rotation angle following by half of the slope of the helicity evolution which is linear in time. Only at small semi-axes a cross-over to a logarithmic divergence occurs. The shrinking dynamics of the antiskyrmion size is found to be accompanied by quadrupole-like oscillations. Numerical simulations on the lattice support the predictions from the continuum model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Within this framework, we derive explicit expressions for the scattering matrix of the dynamic system in a first-order Born approximation, relating it directly to the corresponding static problem. We show that inelastic scattering amplitudes are governed by overlap integrals between static modes at the input and output frequencies. Using this insight, we analyze scattering from a time-modulated, isotropic, dielectric sphere and a high-permittivity dielectric cylinder, and demonstrate how modal orthogonality can suppress inelastic channels, while appropriate tuning of geometric parameters can significantly enhance them. In particular, we show that cylindrical resonators support strong inelastic scattering when resonance-to-resonance optical transitions, induced by the temporal variation, involve a high-Q supercavity mode. Comparison with full time-Floquet calculations confirms that the first-order Born approximation remains quantitatively accurate for modest modulation amplitudes and provides clear physical intuition

This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we revisit the thermodynamic stability of ultraspinning black holes by performing a systematic analysis of the heat capacity in different ensembles over the full range of the horizon radius $r_H$, which were missed in earlier temperature-based analyses. We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $\u03bc$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$.

Here we show that the candidate material Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is characterized by a metastable excitonic insulating phase that is decoupled from the lattice, and that can be stabilized for sufficiently high applied magnetic fields. By considering the interplay between the excitonic and structural instabilities, we predict a magnetic field induced transition from the low-temperature structurally distorted semiconducting phase to an undistorted excitonic insulator phase with ground state loop currents. Before the transition, the existence of a latent excitonic phase can be detected by the magnetic field softening of the phonon mode associated with the structural distortion. These results highlight an unbiased route towards the disentanglement of the coupled excitonic-structural transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and uncover a general mechanism for magnetic field control of competing phases in quantum materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u7684\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u6001\uff0cventionally\u7531\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Ta2NiSe5\u6750\u6599\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f8b\u5b50\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u65bd\u52a0\u78c1\u573a\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u78c1\u6027\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u4ea4\u7ec7\u6001\u5411\u65e0\u7578\u53d8\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u63a7\u5236\u7ade\u4e89\u76f8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u4e0e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6750\u6599\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u65b0\u76f8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Ta2NiSe5\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\u548c\u632f\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u78c1\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9Ta2NiSe5\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u78c1\u6027\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u6fc0\u53d1\u6027\u76f8\u53d8\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Through a nonunitary gauge transformation, the system is mapped onto a disorder-free lattice, enabling exact analytical solutions for the full spectrum and eigenstates.

The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs. With the success in demonstrating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from such sources, an alternative process to generate photon pairs, spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), also starts to attract interest. In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\u03c7^{(2)}$, SFWM can generate photon pairs both directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility $\u03c7^{(3)}$, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN). The existence of both second- and third-order nonlinear processes offers broader opportunities for quantum state engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes.

The natural non-BPS branes for symmetry operators are either 4-branes or non-BPS Kaluza-Klein monopoles. We show that the former can be regarded as a dielectric expansion of the latter, in parallel to the charged operators. We also propose symTh and symTFT candidates for the $SO(6)_R$ symmetry, whose operators at the boundary must correspond to the non-BPS branes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By employing the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we derive the equation of motion for the field expectation value, which incorporates not only the standard local radiative corrections but also novel nonlocal features: a memory term and a stochastic noise term. We identify all ultraviolet divergent structures within these nonlocal terms and provide a consistent renormalization procedure. To analyze the physical impact of these terms, we apply a local approximation under the assumption of slowly-varying fields, by which the memory term acts as a negative contribution to the drift coefficient. As a concrete application, we consider a massive $\u03c6^4$ theory and show that these one-loop corrections lead to a suppression of the field variance in the infrared regime compared to the tree-level results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u5e73 Friedman-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker\uff08FLRW\uff09\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Schwinger-Keldysh\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bfc\u51fa\u573a\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6807\u51c6\u5c40\u57df\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u56de\u54cd\u9879\u548c\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u9879\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u56de\u54cd\u9879\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1f\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u7cfb\u6570\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u4ee5\u03c6\u2074\u660eMass\u7406\u8bba\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u73af\u4fee\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u573a\u65b9\u5dee\u5728\u7ea2\u5916 regime\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u6811\u7ea7\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u6240\u6291\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u573a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Schwinger-Keldysh\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u73af\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u573a\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u56de\u54cd\u9879\u548c\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u9879\u7684\u53d1\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u73af\u4fee\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u573a\u65b9\u5dee\u5728\u7ea2\u5916 regime\u4e2d\u88ab\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u03c6\u2074\u660eMass\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u6b21\u4fee\u6b63\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u573a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this setup, a quantum point contact bends a single edge into a loop, where tunneling occurs at the open end and is controlled by the QPC voltage. In contrast with previously studied two-edge geometries, the weak backscattering regime is dominated by the first-order perturbative term, allowing quantum transport quantities to factorize into a non-universal prefactor and a braiding-induced contribution that provides direct access to the universal statistical angle $\u03c0\u03bb$. While previous analyses neglected edge-to-edge capacitance, we show that capacitive effects, which are known to play a crucial role in mesoscopic capacitors, modify both the current and the current cross-correlations. Using a two-point Green's function formalism augmented by Dyson's equation to include the charging energy, we quantify how the fluctuations of the cross-correlations depend simultaneously on $\u03bb$ and on the capacitance of the loop.

After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same.

Therefore, formation of a singularity in modified theories of gravity is not always a generic outcome but can occur only along algebraically admissible branches selected by Riemannian curvature invariants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9000\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9000\u5316\u662f\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u9650\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5229\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf$f(R)$\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u66f2\u7387\u6216\u6807\u91cf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u62c9\u4f38\u963b\u9694\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9000\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u662f\u5426\u603b\u662f\u5fc5\u7136\u7684\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4f1a\u88ab\u963b\u9694\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5ea6\u91cf$f(R)$\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u5e7f\u7c7b\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9000\u5316\u5bf9\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff1a\u5728\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u5fc5\u7136\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9009\u51fa\u5141\u8bb8\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5947\u70b9\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7acb\u4f53\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

A new avenue was recently opened in this field by predicting that the Josephson quantum mechanics in the odd parity sector, when a quasiparticle in trapped in an Andreev bound state, is fundamentally different from the conventional one in the even sector. The focus was then on a Josephson junction surrounded by an electromagnetic environment formed of a collection of bosonic modes, including the case of an ohmic environment. Here we consider the distinct case of a superconducting qubit made of a single Josephson junction whose environment reduces to a capacitance. We find a novel structure for the low-lying discrete states in the odd sector, which is altogether different from the one that appears in the even sector. Our study of the bound-state spectrum ranges from the Coulomb-dominated (Cooper pair box) to the Josephson-dominated (transmon) regime.

We formulate the task of predicting quantum evolution in the linear response regime as a specific instance of learning a Complex-Valued Linear Dynamical System (CLDS) with sector-bounded eigenvalues -- a setting that also encompasses modern Structured State Space Models (SSMs). While traditional system identification attempts to reconstruct full system matrices (incurring exponential cost in the Hilbert dimension), we propose Quantum Spectral Filtering, a method that shifts the goal to improper dynamic learning. Leveraging the optimal concentration properties of the Slepian basis, we prove that the learnability of such systems is governed strictly by an effective quantum dimension $k^*$, determined by the spectral bandwidth and memory horizon.

In this work, the experimental detection of hybrid optical anapoles in dielectric microspheres (TiO2) is reported using dual detection optical spectroscopy, developed to enable sequential measurement of forward and backward scattering under tightly_focused Gaussian beam (TFGB) illumination. The results show that the excitation of TiO2 microspheres (diameter, d approx. 1 um) under TFGB illumination leads to the appearance of scattering minima in both the forward and backward directions within specific wavelength ranges.

A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime.

The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (\u03b1) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (\u03b1) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior.

Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (\u03b1) and (Q) are derived.

However, no explicit \\emph{qubit} qLDPC family is known that simultaneously has constant rate, linear distance, bounded stabilizer weight, and a native \\emph{magic-state fountain} that prepares many non-Clifford resource states in constant depth.\n  We take a structural approach and identify coding-theoretic conditions under which a CSS qLDPC family necessarily supports a constant-depth $\\CCZ$ magic-state fountain. The key ingredients are: (i) an algebraic notion of \\emph{magic-friendly triples} of $X$-type logical operators, defined by pairwise orthogonality and a triple-overlap form controlling diagonal $\\CCZ$ phases, and (ii) a 3-uniform hypergraph model of physical $\\CCZ$ circuits combined with a packing lemma that turns large collections of such triples with bounded overlaps into bounded-degree hypergraphs.\n  Our main theorem shows that if a CSS code family on $n$ qubits admits $\u03a9(n^{1+\u03b3})$ magic-friendly triples whose supports have bounded per-qubit participation, then there exists a constant-depth circuit of physical $\\CCZ$ gates implementing $\u03a9(n^\u03b3)$ logical $\\CCZ$ gates in parallel while preserving distance up to a constant factor.

In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u5bf9\u5730 Monthly \u548c\u6781\u8ddd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u7434\u53f0 (LISA) \u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c determine parameter estimation for effect's amplitude, and discuss \u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u7b97\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5728 LISA \u8ba1\u5212\u5bff\u547d\u5185\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730 Monthly \u548c\u6781\u8ddd\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u7434\u53f0 (LISA) \u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u76d1\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528 LISA \u4eea\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u62df\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u91cd\u6784\u5176\u632f\u5e45\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba \u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "paper estimates the detectability and occurrence rate of displacement memory effect caused by massive black hole binary mergers within the LISA mission lifetime.", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 LISA \u6070\u597d\u9002\u5408\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c Characterize \u4f4d\u79fb\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, as non-Hermitian systems typically contain more degrees of freedom, this poses a challenge for analytical approaches to understand their topology and invariants. In this work, we analytically calculate the 2D Zak phase for a 2D non-Hermitian SSH-type Hamiltonian that supports a rich structure and edge currents. Closed-form expressions for eigenstates and divisions of the phase diagram are obtained, including for regions in the phase diagram where different types of exceptional points exist. We use Morse theory to determine the topology of exceptional points in momentum space. Although the band structure breaks down at exceptional points, we show that a specific phase-based topological invariant remains well-defined. Furthermore, our work yields an analytic derivation for counting edge states in the Hermitian limit.

However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis.

Furthermore, we consider a distributed loss configuration where the idler incurs loss as it propagates in the nonlinear medium.

However, conventional methods are resource-intensive, and even many machine-learning-based approaches necessitate large training datasets, creating a significant experimental bottleneck for data acquisition. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture integrating Convolutional and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (CNN-BiLSTM). This design leverages CNNs for local feature extraction and BiLSTMs for sequential dependency modeling, enabling robust feature learning from minimal training data. We investigate two fusion paradigms: Architecture 1 (flattening-based) and Architecture 2 (dimensionality-transforming). When trained on only 100 samples, Architecture 2 maintains classification accuracies exceeding 90% for both 3-qubit and 4-qubit systems, demonstrating rapid loss convergence within tens of epochs. Under full-data conditions (400 000 samples), both architectures achieve accuracies above 99.97%. Comparative benchmarks reveal that our CNN-BiLSTM models, especially Architecture 2, consistently outperform standalone CNNs, BiLSTMs, and MLPs in low-data regimes, albeit with increased training time. These results demonstrates that the tailored CNN-BiLSTM fusion significantly alleviates experimental data acquisition burden, offering a practical pathway toward scalable entanglement verification in complex quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A central limitation of QEM is its substantial sampling overhead, which necessitates long execution times where device noise may drift, potentially compromising the reliability of standard mitigation protocols. QEM strategies based on agnostic noise amplification (ANA) are intrinsically resilient to such noise variations, but their sampling cost remains a major practical bottleneck. Here we introduce a mitigation framework that combines virtual noise scaling with a layered mitigation architecture, yielding orders of magnitude reduction in runtime overhead compared to conventional zero-noise extrapolation post-processing. The proposed approach is compatible with dynamic circuits and can be seamlessly integrated with error detection and quantum error correction schemes.

To survive in a realistic noisy environment, magic states must be prepared fault-tolerantly and protected by a quantum error-correcting code. The recent discovery of highly efficient quantum low-density parity-check codes, together with efficient logic gates, lays the groundwork for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation. This motivates the search for fast and parallel protocols for logical magic state preparation to enable universal quantum computation. Here, we introduce a fast code surgery procedure that performs a fault-tolerant measurement of many transversal logic gates in parallel. This is achieved by performing a generalized gauging measurement on a quantum code that supports a higher-form transversal gate. The time overhead of our procedure is constant, and the qubit overhead is linear. The procedure inherits fault-tolerance properties from the base code and the structure of the higher-form transversal gate. When applied to codes that support higher-form Clifford gates our procedure achieves fast and fault-tolerant preparation of many magic states in parallel.

Compared to the SAT-solver-based compiler, which provides optimal results only for small circuits before becoming intractable, TopoLS offers an effective and scalable solution for lattice-surgery compilation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoLS \u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 ZX \u7535\u8def\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86 33% \u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e14\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u7684 compiled \u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c fault-tolerant quantum computing\uff08\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u3002Surface codes\uff08\u8868\u9762\u7801\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "TopoLS \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e ZX \u7535\u8def\u56fe\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c Monte Carlo \u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06 ZX \u7535\u8def\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cTopoLS \u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5212\u5206\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7 Evaluations \u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0cTopoLS \u5e73\u5747\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11 33% \u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e SAT-solver \u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cTopoLS \u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u5219\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoLS \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u3002"}}

Alternatively, for every quantum state at the senders end, there exist d-encoding operations which produce d-orthogonal quantum states. Transmitting which via a d-level perfect quantum channel it is possible to communicate log d-bits of classical information. But what if the set of encoding operations is restricted only within a physically constrained class? Here, we consider such a class of encoding operations to be the set of free operations for any quantum resource theory and show that the constrained capacity - namely, the free encoding capacity (FEC) emerged as a unit of the corresponding quantum resource. Moreover, we show that for the pointed resource theories - a resource theory admitting only a single free state - FEC becomes a faithful resource measure also. We also discuss the implications of FEC in the question of resource-theoretic state transformations and the possibility of extending its faithfulness for general quantum resource theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This product structure leads to the distinction between product states and entangled states; moreover, one can quantify entanglement by considering the distance of a quantum state to the set of product states. The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and beyond, for instance in the computation of the injective tensor norm in multilinear algebra. Here, we introduce a method to determine the maximal overlap of a pure multiparticle quantum state with product states based on considering several copies of the pure state. This leads to three types of hierarchical approximations to the problem, all of which we prove to converge to the actual value. Besides allowing for the computation of the geometric measure of entanglement, our results can be used to tackle optimizations over stochastic local transformations, to find entanglement witnesses for weakly entangled bipartite states, and to design strong separability tests for mixed multiparticle states.

Yet, their performance is limited by the effects of disorder and electrodynamic inhomogeneities that are not well understood. By combining DC transport, dark-count measurements, and bias-dependent microwave transmission spectroscopy in the presence of controlled nanoscale disorder introduced through helium-ion irradiation, we distinguish local instability-driven processes from intrinsic superconducting depairing and kinetic inductance nonlinearities. This approach enables systematic tuning of kinetic inductance, depairing currents, microwave dissipation, and mode structure within a single device. Bias- and temperature-dependent resonance shifts quantify disorder-induced modifications of the superconducting density of states through the nonlinear kinetic inductance, while the emergence of multiple resonant modes reveals the formation of electrodynamically distinct superconducting regions.

To accomplish this, scrambling dynamics are leveraged to map distinct signals to unique patterns of bitstring measurements, which distinguishes a large number of signals without significant sensitivity loss. Based on this principle, we develop a computationally efficient protocol utilizing random global Clifford unitaries and evaluate its performance both analytically and numerically. Our protocol naturally extends to scrambling dynamics generated by random local Clifford circuits, local random unitary circuits (RUCs), and ergodic Hamiltonian evolution--commonly realized in near-term quantum hardware--and opens the door to applications ranging from precise noise benchmarking of quantum dynamics to learning time-dependent Hamiltonians.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u53d7\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8bfb\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u4f73\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f30\u7b97\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6270\u4e71\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4e32\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u5927\u91cf\u533a\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5168\u5c40Clifford\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\uff0c both\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7531\u968f\u673a\u672c\u5730Clifford\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u3001\u5c40\u57df\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7535\u8def\uff08RUC\uff09\u548c\u901a\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6270\u4e71\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u53d8\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u53f7\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5168\u5c40Clifford\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff08\u5982\u968f\u673a\u672c\u5730Clifford\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u548c\u5c40\u57df\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u95e8\u7535\u8def\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6270\u4e71\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u53e0\u52a0\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5145\u5206\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u7eaf\u51c0\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\\ell) \\sim \\ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u7269\u8d28\u53d1\u751f\u8fde\u7eed\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5747\u8861\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3002 urlk\u673a\u5236\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u4e0b\u70b9\u72b6\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u5feb\u548c\u6162\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e holographic\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u5faa\u73af\u5f26\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u5f53\u6162\u5feb\u5207\u6362\u65f6\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u5f26\u6570\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u663e\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e09\u7ef4\u968f\u673a\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u8fd4\u56de\u7edf\u8ba1\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u70b9\u72b6\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u8d4b\u4e88\u666e\u9002\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5747\u8861\u52a8\u6001\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a763\u7ef4holographic\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u5faa\u73af\u5f26\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6162\u5feb\u5207\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5f26\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4f53\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u5feb\u5207\u6362\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u70b9\u72b6\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u70b9\u72b6\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
