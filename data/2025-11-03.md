Abstract: We investigate entropy transport for universal scaling phenomena in closed
quantum many-body systems far from equilibrium. From spatially resolved
experimental data of a spinor Bose gas, we demonstrate that entropy decreases
on long-distance scales while it increases at short distances. A dynamical
separation of scales leads to macrophysics with long-range order, which is
insensitive to the highly entropic microphysical processes. Since the total von
Neumann entropy is conserved on a fundamental level for the quantum system, our
analysis reveals a reciprocal connection between the emergence of macroscopic
structure and microscopic disorder. To illustrate the scope of this connection,
we exemplify the universal phenomenon also in a relativistic quantum field
theory calculation from first principles, which is relevant for particle
physics and early-universe cosmology.

Abstract: Cold-atom experiments which measure Fermi-gas properties near unitarity
confine fermionic atoms to a region of space using trapping potentials of
various shapes. The presence of a trapping potential introduces a new
characteristic physical scale in the superfluid EFT which, inter alia,
describes the acoustic branch of excitations in the far infrared well below the
scale of the superfluid gap. In this EFT there is a clear hierarchy of scales,
and corrections to the homogeneous system due to the trapping potential may be
organized into three regions with distinct power counting that relies on both
the EFT derivative expansion, and the WKB approximation, which is an expansion
in gradients of the trapping potential. The energy spectrum of the superfluid
system is obtained in each of the regions by explicit computation of the
phonon-field fluctuations, and by the modifications to the dynamic structure
factor due to the corresponding density fluctuations. The most significant
deviations from linear dispersion due to the trapping potential are found in
the far infrared region of the superfluid EFT.

Abstract: The Dicke-Hubbard model, describing an ensemble of interacting atoms in a
cavity, provides a rich platform for exploring collective quantum phenomena.
However, its potential for quantum thermodynamic applications remains largely
uncharted. Here, we study a quantum Otto heat engine whose working substance is
a system governed by the Dicke-Hubbard Hamiltonian. Through the research on
steady-state superradiance phase transitions, it is demonstrated that the
steady-state synergistic mechanism under high and low temperature environments
is the reason for the emergence of high-performance heat engines. By analyzing
the influences of atom-light coupling strength, inter-cavity hopping strength
and atom number on the working modes of quantum Otto cycle, it is clarified
that the effective working regions of each working mode. This work has
established a close connection between superradiance phase transition and the
quantum thermodynamic applications. It not only deepens our understanding of
the energy conversion mechanism in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics but
also lays a theoretical foundation for the future experimental design of
high-performance quantum Otto heat engines.

Abstract: We demonstrate characteristics of a bosonic fractional quantum Hall (FQH)
state in a one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model (eBHM) with a static
tilt. In the large tilt limit, quenched kinetic energy leads to emergent dipole
moment conservation, enabling mapping to a model generating FQH states. Using
exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, and an analytical
transfer matrix approach, we analyze energy and entanglement properties to
reveal FQH correlations. Our findings set the stage for the use of quenched
kinetics in simple time-reversal invariant eBHMs to explore emergent phenomena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding phase transitions and their impact on cellular processes is crucial for advancing biophysical research.

Method: A framework combining models and Monte Carlo simulations to study domain dynamics and molecular interactions.

Result: Domain size perturbations near critical points affect PPI dynamics, suggesting sensitivity to membrane phase behavior.

Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of phase transitions in determining membrane system behavior and PPI networks' functionality.

Abstract: Many protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks take place in the fluid yet
structured plasma membrane. Lipid domains, sometimes termed rafts, have been
implicated in the functioning of various membrane-bound signaling processes.
Here, we present a model and a Monte Carlo simulation framework to investigate
how changes in the domain size that arise from perturbations to membrane
criticality can lead to changes in the rate of interactions among components,
leading to altered outcomes. For simple PPI networks, we show that the activity
can be highly sensitive to thermodynamic parameters near the critical point of
the membrane phase transition. When protein-protein interactions change the
partitioning of some components, our system sometimes forms out of equilibrium
domains we term pockets, driven by a mixture of thermodynamic interactions and
kinetic sorting. More generally, we predict that near the critical point many
different PPI networks will have their outcomes depend sensitively on
perturbations that influence critical behavior.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The remarkable progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has revealed the
enormous energy demands of modern digital architectures, raising deep concerns
about sustainability. In stark contrast, the human brain operates efficiently
on only ~20 watts, and individual cells process gigabit-scale genetic
information using energy on the order of trillionths of a watt. Under the same
energy budget, a general-purpose digital processor can perform only a few
simple operations per second. This striking disparity suggests that biological
systems follow algorithms fundamentally distinct from conventional computation.
The framework of information thermodynamics-especially Maxwell's demon and the
Szilard engine-offers a theoretical clue, setting the lower bound of energy
required for information processing. However, digital processors exceed this
limit by about six orders of magnitude. Recent single-molecule studies have
revealed that biological molecular motors convert Brownian motion into
mechanical work, realizing a "demon-like" operational principle. These findings
suggest that living systems have already implemented an ultra-efficient
information-energy conversion mechanism that transcends digital computation.
Here, we experimentally establish a quantitative correspondence between
positional information (bits) and mechanical work, demonstrating that molecular
machines selectively exploit rare but functional fluctuations arising from
Brownian motion to achieve ATP-level energy efficiency. This integration of
information, energy, and timescale indicates that life realizes a Maxwell's
demon-like mechanism for energy-efficient information processing.

Motivation: 了解微生物如何通过运动状态调控渗透性有助于解决水文和工程中的相关问题。

Method: 使用微流控技术、压力梯度和时滞显微镜进行实验。

Result: 有动机的细菌和非运动细菌导致的渗透性损失差异显著，分别为78%和94%。

Conclusion: 生物膜的空间组织是决定渗透性变化的主要因素。

Abstract: Biofilms in porous media critically influence hydraulic properties in
environmental and engineered systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of
how microbial life controls permeability remains elusive. By combining
microfluidics, controlled pressure gradient and time-lapse microscopy, we
quantify how motile and non-motile bacteria colonize a porous landscape and
alter its resistance to flow. We find that while both strains achieve nearly
identical total biomass, they cause drastically different permeability
reductions - 78% for motile cells versus 94% for non-motile cells. This
divergence stems from motility, which limits biomass spatial accumulation,
whereas non-motile cells clog the entire system. We develop a mechanistic model
that accurately predicts permeability dynamics from the pore-scale biomass
distribution. We conclude that the spatial organization of biomass, not its
total amount, is the primary factor controlling permeability.

Abstract: We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole
polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit,
i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in
reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole
autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell
sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in
imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics.
For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the
imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data
within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as
the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant.
Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference,
remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response,
quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in
plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as
epsilon-near-zero materials.

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum
computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high
connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers
have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum
algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in
linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the
first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers
to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based
on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for
spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling
between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately
a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling,
we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers.
Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement
between spin qubits in distant registers.

Abstract: Rydberg excitons in the semiconductor Cu$_2$O have been observed in
absorption experiments up to a principal quantum number of n = 28 at
millikelvin temperatures [1]. Here, we extend the experimental parameter space
by variing both temperature and excitation power. In particular, we show that
the P excitons close to the band gap react more sensitively to an increase of
the excitation power than states of the associated D exciton multiplet, even
though the latter are located at comparatively higher energy. This finding is
similar to the one observed when applying an external electric field,
suggesting that the observed behavior arises from internal electric fields
created by charged impurities that are optically ionized. At laser intensities
below 1 $\mu$W/cm$^2$, absorption lines of excitons with n=29 are observed.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method that can identify
patterns in large, complex data sets by constructing low-dimensional order
parameters from higher-dimensional feature vectors. There are increasing
efforts to use space-and-time-dependent PCA to detect transitions in
nonequilibrium systems that are difficult to characterize with equilibrium
methods. Here, we demonstrate that feature vectors incorporating the position
and velocity information of driven skyrmions moving through random disorder
permit PCA to resolve different types of disordered skyrmion motion as a
function of driving force and the ratio of the Magnus force to the dissipation.
Since the Magnus force creates gyroscopic motion and a finite Hall angle,
skyrmions can exhibit a greater range of flow phases than what is observed in
overdamped driven systems with quenched disorder. We show that in addition to
identifying previously known skyrmion flow phases, PCA detects several
additional phases, including different types of channel flow, moving fluids,
and partially ordered states. Guided by the PCA analysis, we further
characterize the disordered flow phases to elucidate the different microscopic
dynamics and show that the changes in the PCA-derived order parameters can be
connected to features in bulk transport measures, including the transverse and
longitudinal velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, topological
defect density, and changes in the skyrmion Hall angle as a function of drive.
We discuss how asymmetric feature vectors can be used to improve the resolution
of the PCA analysis, and how this technique can be extended to find disordered
phases in other nonequilibrium systems with time-dependent dynamics.

Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for
investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface
Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral
band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by
means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we
investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry
curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials
belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198,
our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the
energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite
chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO
effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and
magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under
experimentally feasible electric biases.

Abstract: Chiral molecules are known to preferentially select electrons with a
particular spin state, an effect termed chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS). In this work, the transient CISS dynamics in a chiral molecule are
investigated through time-dependent quantum-transport simulations, an important
step toward further understanding CISS and its application in devices such as
magnetoresistive random access memories and spin-based quantum computers. We
show that a nonzero spin polarization throughout the chiral molecule can be
attributed to a spin-dependent group velocity of electrons. Contrary to the
case where a chiral molecule is connected to a single lead, this spin
polarization persists into the steady state when two leads are connected. We
show that the simulated spin polarization qualitatively agrees with a reference
experiment, as evidenced by the distinct magnetic-field signatures calculated
from the spin polarization within a monolayer of chiral molecules.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance
in the Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide, based on a system
Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour
hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field induced by magnetic
proximity, and a charge density wave potential. Our analysis reveals that the
Nernst conductivity exhibits a non monotonic temperature dependence. It
increases with temperature, reaches a pronounced peak, and subsequently
declines at higher temperatures due to thermal broadening, which diminishes the
influence of Berry curvature. Notably, small shifts in the chemical potential
can lead to dramatic changes in the Nernst signal enhancing its magnitude or
even reversing its sign highlighting the system sensitivity to carrier density.
We further explore the anomalous Hall behaviour within this framework. The band
structure hosts multiple bands with nonzero Berry curvature, and preliminary
Chern number calculations suggest weak topological features, namely, while not
fully quantized, the system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation.
Upon introducing momentum space winding, implemented via a momentum dependent
phase in the complex hopping terms to mimic orbital magnetic flux, we observe
that two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers. The remaining bands remain
topologically trivial.

Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to
magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm
based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered,
as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been
achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a
rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In
mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable
switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does
not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent
magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque
with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad
range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for
practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in
CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance
exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable
energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable
step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and
storage technologies.

Abstract: Mechanical systems are pivotal in quantum technologies because of their long
coherent time and versatile coupling to qubit systems. So far, the coherent and
dynamic control of gigahertz-frequency mechanical modes mostly relies on
optomechanical coupling and piezoelectric coupling to superconducting qubits.
Here, we demonstrate on-chip cavity electro-acoustic dynamics using our
microwave-frequency electrically-modulated phononic-crystal (PnC) resonators on
lithium niobate (LN). Leveraging the high dispersion of PnC, our phononic modes
space unevenly in the frequency spectrum, emulating atomic energy levels.
Atomic-like transitions between different phononic modes are achieved by
applying electrical fields to modulate phononic modes via nonlinear
piezoelectricity of LN. Among two modes, we demonstrate Autler-Townes splitting
(ATS), alternating current (a.c.) Stark shift, and Rabi oscillation with a
maximum cooperativity of 4.18. Extending to three modes, we achieve
non-reciprocal frequency conversions with an isolation up to 20 dB.
Nonreciprocity can be tuned by the time delay between the two modulating
pulses. Our cavity electro-acoustic platform could find broad applications in
sensing, microwave signal processing, phononic computing, and quantum
acoustics.

Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early
Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data
from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable
signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive
gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data
to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early
Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff
equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations,
primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the
presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and
neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered.
We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics
models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo
data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe
scenarios.

Abstract: In view of recent interest in the role of "dark" radiation in cosmology, such
as cosmic gravitational waves, sterile neutrinos, and dark photons, we clarify
the definition of adiabatic initial conditions in the kinetic theory of gases
in an expanding universe. Without assuming any form for the phase space
distribution function, we identify two possibilities: a strong and a weak
adiabatic initial condition. The strong one corresponds to the standard
adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via
internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic
initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although
the latter requires initial internal isocurvature. In passing, we stress the
importance of using the particle local momentum in the phase space to define
the notion of adiabatic initial conditions. Doing so, we clarify that a gas of
gravitons can have adiabatic initial conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across
surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error
correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge
invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space.
The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates
an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann
algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole
entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of
the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the
black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The
algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the
entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.

Abstract: High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in
interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light
noise. To minimize it, optical components must meet tight requirements on
surface roughness and bulk defects. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these
measures can be undermined by other sources of scattered light. In this
article, we examine scattered light noise caused by particles deposited on
surfaces, especially on the baffles inside the vacuum pipes of the Einstein
Telescope's interferometer arms. First, we study light scattering by particles
deposited on a surface and having diameters from about one tenth to hundred
times the light wavelength: we discuss its angular distribution and dependence
on particle size and refractive index, and on polarization. Then, we specialize
to the case of the Einstein Telescope arms and quantify the maximum allowed
density of particles on each arm baffle. We conclude with cleanliness
guidelines for the assembly of the vacuum pipes, including the required
cleanliness class of the installation environment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The non-factorizing nature of the Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)
due to gauge invariance requires a generalized definition of entanglement
entropy. This work employs the framework of von Neumann algebras to investigate
the entanglement entropy in LQG. On a graph, the holonomy and flux operators
within a region and on the boundary generate a non-factor type I von Neumann
algebra, which is used to define the entanglement entropy for LQG states. This
algebraic formalism is applied to ``fixed-area states''--superpositions of spin
networks associated with a surface with a definite macroscopic area given by
the LQG area spectrum. By maximizing the entropy, we derive a geometrical area
law where the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area. In addition, we
show that bulk entanglement can renormalize the area-law coefficient and
produce logarithmic corrections. The results in this paper closely relate to
LQG black hole entropy.

Abstract: This paper investigates entanglement entropy in 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian
covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We compute the entanglement entropy for a
spatial region from states dynamically generated by a spinfoam path integral
that sums over a family of 2-complexes. The resulting entropy exhibits a
geometric area law, $S \simeq \beta a$, where the area $a$ of the entangling
surface is determined by the LQG area spectrum and the leading coefficient
$\beta>0$ is independent of the underlying 2-complexes. By relating the
coupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
$\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 < \gamma
\lesssim 1/2$. This work provides a Lorentzian path integral approach to
gravitational entropy without the need for contour prescriptions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in
spinfoam quantum gravity. It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam
stack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of
2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of
faces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing
the amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area
of internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an
integral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold.
This manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the
underlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics
from a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF
theory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a
powerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a
triangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends
only on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result
that is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This
provides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined
limit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of
quantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism.

Abstract: The article studies the dynamical behavior of axial gravitational
perturbations of homogeneous stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Because the
radial coordinate $r$ transforms into the tortoise coordinate $y = y(r)$,
obeying $y(r=0)=0$ and $y(r\rightarrow\infty)=y_\text{max}<\infty$, the
tortoise coordinates domain is finite, and the gravitational waves fail to
reach out of the domain. Thus, from the perspective of tortoise coordinates,
the perturbation equation of uniform density stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime
is analogous to the infinite deep potential well in quantum mechanics.
Therefore, the perturbative behavior in this spacetime represents a standing
wave vibration. Here we use shooting method and finite difference method to
show the imagery of standing waves in this spacetime for $n=0,1,2$ as examples.
On the other hand, by finite difference method, a Gaussian wave packet bounces
back and forth within this potential well. Furthermore, due to the shape of the
gravitational potential function $V$ within the range $0\le y\le y_\text{max}$,
an echo phenomenon occurs at the surface of the star. As the energy of the wave
packet remains within the potential well, each time it traverses the surface of
the star, a reflective echo is generated. Consequently, after multiple
reflections, the Gaussian wave packet cannot maintain its original shape and
ultimately disperses.

Abstract: It is known that the mass of magnetized relativistic compact star is larger
than that of non-magnetized one for the same equation of state and central

strong enough B~10^17-10^18G. Using our recently developed numerical code
COCAL, we systematically compute such compact star solutions in equilibrium
associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, and show the
magnetically supramassive solutions whose masses exceed by more than 10% of the
maximum mass of the static and spherically symmetric solutions. For some
extremely strong magnetic field configurations, we also obtain solutions more
massive than the maximum mass of the uniformly rotating solutions at the Kepler

Abstract: The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a rotating quantum corrected black hole
(RQCBH) are studied by employing the hyperboloidal framework for the scalar
perturbation. This framework is used to cast the QNMs spectra problem into the
two-dimensional eigenvalues problem, then the spectra are calculated by
imposing two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method. Based on the resulting
spectra, a parameter estimation pipeline for this RQCBH model with
gravitational wave data is constructed by using \texttt{pyRing} in the ringdown
phase. We find that, even when the RQCBH spectra exhibits a small deviation
from the Kerr spectra, the strong correlation between the extra parameter
coming from the quantum gravity theory and the intrinsic parameter of black
hole may significantly affect the posterior distributions of the mass $M$ and
the dimensionless spin $\bar{a}$.

Conclusion:  demonstrated a promising new path in constructing observationally viable dark energy models, providing a fresh approach to cosmological phenomenology in gravity studies.

Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark
energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications
in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this
approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving
dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be
simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in
second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we
derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP
model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we
also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to
$f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as
superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect
the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction
(DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the
emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and
their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be
extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and,
therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the
dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing
ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the
properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the
stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant
DM parameters.

*Vitalii Vertogradov,Maksim Grigorev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Black holes with two horizons have a unique thermodynamic behavior compared to Schwarzschild black holes. The study shows that evaporation can lead to a black hole cooling to zero temperature as mass decreases. Phase transitions, where temperature peaks and heat capacity diverges, occur under certain conditions related to the null energy condition (NEC). The presence of these transitions is influenced by regions where the NEC is violated, affecting the black hole's dynamics and thermodynamic stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of black holes, particularly those with multiple horizons, is crucial for exploring the interplay between general relativity and thermodynamics. This study seeks to uncover how varying physical parameters influence black hole evaporation and its associated thermodynamic behaviors.

Method: This research employed analytical and numerical methods to investigate the temperature dynamics of the Kiselev black hole. The analysis focused on the relationship between the mass parameter $M$, anisotropic fluid parameter $N$, and the null energy condition.

Result: The primary finding is that under specific conditions, the black hole temperature does not diverge during evaporation. Instead, it consistently decreases to zero as the black hole mass diminishes. Additionally, phase transitions characterized by temperature peaks and heat capacity divergences are found to be sensitive to the regions where the null energy condition is violated. When the global NEC is violated, the black hole horizons merge, and temperature suppression occurs. In contrast, partial or no violation of the NEC allows for standard evaporation behavior.

Conclusion: This research establishes a direct correspondence between the thermodynamic stability, horizon dynamics, and the structure of energy conditions in anisotropic black hole spacetimes. It highlights how the violation of the null energy condition can significantly impact the evaporation process and related thermodynamic properties of black holes.

Abstract: The evaporation of black holes with two horizons presents a rich
thermodynamic landscape that departs fundamentally from the Schwarzschild
paradigm. In this work, we analyze the Hawking temperature dynamics of the
Kiselev black hole under varying mass $M$ and anisotropic fluid parameter $N$,
explicitly connecting temperature behavior to phase transitions and violations
of the null energy condition (NEC). We find that the temperature does not
necessarily diverge during evaporation; instead, it typically falls to zero as
the black hole evaporates. This cooling behavior is preceded, in certain
parameter regimes, by a phase transition marked by a peak in temperature and a
divergence in heat capacity. Crucially, the presence and nature of these phase
transitions are dictated by the spacetime regions where the NEC is violated:
global NEC violation leads to horizon merger and temperature suppression, while
partial or absent violation can restore the standard evaporation picture. Our
results establish a direct correspondence between thermodynamic stability,
horizon dynamics, and energy condition structure in anisotropic black hole
spacetimes.

TL;DR: An exact renormalization group equation is introduced for classical gravitational systems, providing a non-perturbative framework that correctly reproduces the first three Post-Minkowskian orders, including efficiently recovering the 1PN two-body action without complex vertex calculations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detection has increased the need for efficient and precise modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current methods, such as Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian expansions, are inherently perturbative and computationally expensive. There is a need for a new framework that can handle strong-field dynamics without relying on perturbation techniques.

Method: An exact renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems is introduced. This RG equation is demonstrated to correctly reproduce the first three Post-Minkowskian expansion orders. The RG framework provides a non-perturbative approach, bypassing complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic nonlinearity of the RG flow.

Result: The exact RG equation successfully reproduces the first three Post-Minkowskian expansion orders. It efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, demonstrating its capability to handle strong-field dynamics without perturbative methods.

Conclusion: The exact renormalization group equation offers a powerful new tool for modeling strong-field gravitational systems, enabling non-perturbative approximations and calculations that were previously computationally intensive or infeasible.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has intensified the need for efficient,
high-precision modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current
analytical methods, primarily the Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian
expansions, are inherently perturbative, while numerical relativity remains
computationally expensive. In this Letter, we introduce a middle path: an exact
renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems. We
demonstrate that our equation correctly reproduces the first three orders of
the Post-Minkowskian expansion. Crucially, it provides a framework for
non-perturbative approximations. As a first application, we show that our
method efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, bypassing the need for
complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic
nonlinearity of the RG flow. This establishes the exact RG as a powerful new
tool for tackling strong-field dynamics in gravity.

Abstract: We revisit Schr\"odinger CFTs from a modern point of view. We introduce the
''harmonic trap geometry,'' analogous to the cylinder picture in relativistic
CFTs, and demonstrate a state-operator correspondence that applies to all
operators, including descendant, massless, and ''normal-ordered operators.'' A
thermofield double construction plays an extremely important role. We
systematically classify all physical spectra in the harmonic trap and their
unitarity bounds, extending earlier results to include both massless and
massive states of all spins, providing a new analytic treatment of unitarity
bounds, and establishing foundations for a bootstrap. In our reformulation,
previously known perturbative non-renormalization theorems follow immediately
from non-perturbative factorization at fixed points and along RG flows.
Massless states are described by an effective 1d CFT, as predicted by DLCQ, and
violate the non-renormalization theorems. We include a self-consistent review
of Schr\"odinger CFTs in our framework, making the paper accessible to anyone

The method uses a controlled series expansion that can be extended to higher orders. By integrating differential-equation techniques, restriction theory, and algebraic-geometry methods, the framework derives recursion relations for generating leading-order waveforms in soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes, with potential for higher-loop computations. Constraints from rapid-decay homology reveal that Fourier integrals satisfy ε-form differential equations with Bessel- and exponential-type kernels, paving the way for understanding the exact solution's analytic structure.

Motivation: Gravitational wave physics in binary systems is fundamental for astrophysical applications and theoretical understanding. This work aims to advance systematic computational methods for waveforms across various regimes.

Method: The framework employs a combination of differential-equation techniques, restriction theory, and algebraic-geometry methods to compute Fourier integrals and derive recursion relations for waveform generation.

Result: The framework successfully generates leading-order waveforms in soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes. Additionally, it establishes a methodology for higher-loop computations. The Fourier integrals have been shown to satisfy ε-form differential equations, which is a significant step toward analyzing the analytic structure of exact solutions.

Conclusion: This systematic approach paves the way for more precise and comprehensive modeling of gravitational waveforms in different asymptotic regimes, enhancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications in gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: We present a systematic framework for computing frequency-domain
gravitational waveforms from relativistic binary scattering in different
asymptotic regimes. The method yields a controlled series expansion that can in
principle be extended to arbitrary order in the relevant kinematic parameter.
By combining differential-equation techniques with restriction theory and
algebraic-geometry methods for impact-parameter-space Fourier integrals, we
derive recursion relations that generate the leading-order (tree-level)
waveform in both the soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes, establishing a
proof of principle for extending the approach to higher-loop computations.
Finally, following constraints from rapid-decay homology, we show that the
Fourier integrals underlying the waveform satisfy epsilon-form differential
equations mixing Bessel- and exponential-type kernels, marking a first step
toward uncovering the analytic structure of the exact solution.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究发现了一种利用Q-球提取能量的机制。采用多步函数近似方法，导出了相关的解析解，并通过Bessel函数表示。特别是对于薄壁Q-球，他们将放大因子简化为正弦函数，从而解释了频谱中的多峰结构，并指出了决定这些峰值的物理量。此外，他们还发现在高频率下，峰值间距是Q-球半径的倒数。这些解析结果进一步表明，Q-球的放大因子确实可以通过解析解完全覆盖所有的可能性，这种解析框架对于广义Q-球也大大提高了放大因子计算的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理学家们一直对Q-球中能的传递问题感兴趣。近年来，关于波从Q-球分裂时是否能提取能量的研究引发了许多讨论和实验。掌握这种机制对量子场论、粒子物理和天体物理等领域有重要的意义。

Method: 研究团队采用了多步骤函数近似的方法来描述背景场，并通过解析求解的方法得到了放大因子的表达式。对于单薄壁Q-球，放大因子又可以用更简单的正弦函数表示，简化了计算并提供了直观的理解。

Result: 对于薄壁Q-球，研究结果表明，放大因子的多峰特性可以用简单的正弦函数来解释。峰的数量和位置由Q-球的物理参数决定，并且在高频率时，峰间距与Q-球的半径成反比。更为重要的是，他们建立了完整的放大因子预测模型，通过解析解覆盖了所有可能的放大因子的值。

Conclusion: 研究结果展示了如何利用多步函数方法来解析地计算Q-球的能量传递机制。这意味着，Q-球中能的有效提取机制已经被完全理清。该研究成果对于理解这部分能量传递机制中的关键物理量，以及狭义相对论框架下的能量提取可能性具有指导意义。

Abstract: It was recently discovered that waves scattering off a $Q$-ball can extract
energy from it. We present an analytical treatment of this process by adopting
a multi-step function approximation for the background field, which yields
perturbative solutions expressed in terms of Bessel functions. For thin-wall
$Q$-balls, the amplification factors reduce to simple sinusoidal functions,
which explains the multi-peak structure of the spectrum and identifies the
physical quantities that determine it. For instance, at high frequencies, the
peak spacing is simply the inverse of the $Q$-ball size. The analytical
solution further enables us to delineate the full range of possible
amplification factors. For general $Q$-balls, this analytical framework also
substantially improves the efficiency of evaluating the amplification factors.

Abstract: We consider $\mathfrak{so}_4$ invariant matrix product states (MPS) in the
$\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric integrable spin chain and prove their
integrability. These MPS appear as fuzzy three-sphere solutions of matrix
models with Yang-Mills-type interactions, and in particular they correspond to
scalar defect sectors of $N=4$ SYM. We find that the algebra formed by the
fuzzy three-sphere generators naturally leads to a boundary reflection algebra
and hence a solution to the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for every
representation of the fuzzy three-sphere. This allows us to find closed formula
for the overlaps of Bethe states of $\mathfrak{so}_6$ symmetric chains with the
fuzzy three-sphere MPS for arbitrary bond dimensions.

Abstract: The Coulomb branch geometry of a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT is encoded in the
data of a complex integrable system. In class-S, this is the Hitchin System (of
ADE type) on the punctured curves $C$ on which we compactified from 6d to 4d.
As we vary the complex structure of $C$, these fit together to form a
(nontrivial!) bundle of Hitchin systems over the moduli space of complex
structures of $C$ (the ``conformal manifold'' of the family of SCFTs). We carry
out that construction for type-D. Compared to the type-A case, the construction
is much more complicated because of local constraints at the punctures. Those
local constraints were studied in [1]. Here, we work out their implications for
the global bundle of spectral (Seiberg-Witten) curves.

Conclusion: 结果显示，强相互作用下的pion- pion散射在相同flavor时产生更高的纠缠度。

Abstract: One of the defining features of quantum mechanics is the ability of two
systems to exhibit correlation of information even when they are spatially
separated by large distances. This phenomenon, known as quantum entanglement,
is a fundamental resource for quantum computation and emerging quantum
technologies. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the generation of
entanglement in particle interactions requires a quantitative description of
the entanglement produced by fundamental interactions. For the strong
interaction, this work presents an analysis of the flavor entanglement
generated in pion-pion scattering at one-loop order in chiral perturbation
theory. The amount of entanglement is quantified using the quantum mutual
information, expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropy. The calculation is
performed under fixed pion momenta and initial flavor indices, with the
incoming pions assumed to be in a pure, unentangled state. It is shown that the
resulting flavor entanglement depends on whether the initial pion flavors are
identical or distinct. At threshold, the quantum mutual information reaches
approximately 2.8 in the identical-flavor case, close to the maximal value for
a pair of qutrits, and equals 2 in the distinct-flavor case, corresponding to
the maximal entanglement of two qubits. Analytical expressions for the mutual
information at other kinematical regimes are also provided.

Abstract: We study detector operators measuring energy to a power $\Delta-2$ at null
infinity in four-dimensional gauge theories and gravity. These operators
transform as conformal primaries on the celestial sphere and provide a natural
basis for describing energy-flux observables in scattering processes. Using the
collinear factorization of scattering amplitudes, we derive the universal
leading structure of the operator product expansion. A key consequence of our
analysis is the precise identification of the $\Delta=2$ detector, the number
operator. Exploiting the fact that soft charges generate symmetries of the
S-matrix, we demonstrate that the number of particles is entirely determined by
the product of two soft currents: in gravity, the operator is the square of the
supertranslation generator, while in Yang-Mills yields a product of $SU(N)$
Kac-Moody soft currents. This work establishes thus a direct link between
detector observables and the soft sector of celestial holography.

### [42] [Pseudo-Hermitian QFT: relativistic scattering and symmetry structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27404)
*Ruifeng Leng,Cheng-Yang Lee,Siyi Zhou*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Pseudo-Hermitian operators provide a consistent framework for relativistic quantum scattering with global probability conservation. The paper discusses the structural aspects of this framework, highlighting the role of distinct metric operators for in and out sectors. A general symmetry formalism connects pseudo-unitary transformations with symmetries, and scattering processes behave consistently, promoting Lorentz invariance and unitarity. The CPT theorem holds, and the results support interacting pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories as extensions beyond conventional quantum field theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a novel framework for relativistic quantum field theories using pseudo-Hermitian operators, which are typically associated with open or dissipative systems. The motivation is to extend the pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics formalism to relativistic systems while ensuring global probability conservation and maintaining the unitarity of time evolution.

Method: The paper starts by developing the pseudo-Hermitian framework for relativistic quantum field theory, defining the formalism and its structural features, such as the existence of distinct metric operators for the in and out sectors. It introduces a nontrivial metric projector that guarantees global probability conservation under pseudo-unitary time evolution. The method also involves constructing a general symmetry formalism, demonstrating that each symmetry corresponds to two pseudo-unitary operators associated with the in and out metrics, respectively. The paper then derives the scattering matrix (S-matrix) and shows that it admits a perturbative expansion through the Dyson series while remaining Lorentz invariant and unitary. Finally, the paper verifies the validity of the fundamental CPT theorem within this framework.

Result: The paper demonstrates that pseudo-Hermitian operators can be used to construct a consistent relativistic quantum field theory framework. The key results include the existence of distinct metric operators for the in and out sectors, the perturbative expansion of the scattering matrix that preserves Lorentz invariance and unitarity, and the validity of the CPT theorem. These results open new avenues for exploring the physical implications of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories beyond the standard Hermitian paradigm.

Conclusion: The paper presents a rigorous foundation for interacting pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, showing that they maintain global probability conservation under pseudo-unitary time evolution. The framework is consistent with the conventional Hermitian case in terms of Lorentz invariance and unitarity, and it validates the CPT theorem. This work opens new directions for exploring the physical implications of pseudo-Hermitian operators in quantum field theory beyond the standard Hermitian framework.

Abstract: Unitarity is a cornerstone of quantum theory, ensuring the conservation of
probability and information. Although non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically
associated with open or dissipative systems, pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics
shows that real spectra and unitary evolution can still emerge through a
suitably defined inner product. Motivated by this insight, we extend the
pseudo-Hermitian framework to relativistic quantum field theory and construct a
consistent formulation of scattering processes. A novel structural feature of
this theory is the presence of distinct metric operators for the in and out
sectors, connected through a nontrivial metric projector that guarantees global
probability conservation under pseudo-unitary time evolution. We further
develop a general symmetry formalism, showing that each symmetry generally
corresponds to two pseudo-unitary operators associated with the in and out
metrics, respectively. Within this framework, the scattering matrix admits a
perturbative expansion through the Dyson series and remains Lorentz invariant
and unitary, remarkably in complete agreement with the conventional Hermitian
case. The fundamental CPT theorem is also shown to hold. Our results provide a
rigorous foundation for interacting pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories and
open new directions for exploring their possible physical implications beyond
the standard Hermitian paradigm.

Abstract: We compute the contour integral for the partition function of an
$\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ topologically twisted theory on $\mathbb{CP}^2$,
dimensionally reducing from an $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory on $S^5$. Earlier works
presented the partition function as a sum over three equivariant fluxes, one
for each toric divisor of $\mathbb{CP}^2$. Our result depends only on a single
physical flux, assigned to the non-trivial two-cycle of the manifold. The
reduced summation over fluxes is compensated by a contour of integration,
arising from a different solution of the BPS equations, which captures more
poles in each topological sector. As our observable involves a
position-dependent Yang-Mills coupling, we compute new equivariant invariants
of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which reduce to Donaldson invariants in the non-equivariant
limit. Stability conditions of gauge bundles over $\mathbb{CP}^2$ appear
intrinsically via the dimensional reduction.

Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of integrated correlators for an
$\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory on a squashed sphere with SU$(N)$
gauge group and fundamental/anti-symmetric matter. Employing the matrix model
arising from supersymmetric localisation, we compute derivatives of the
partition function $\mathcal{Z}$ with respect to the fundamental mass ($\mu$),
the anti-symmetric mass ($m$) and the squashing parameter ($b$), corresponding
to integrated insertions of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ flavour-current and
stress-tensor multiplets, which are holographically dual to gluon and graviton
scatterings in the presence of D7-branes. For correlators dual to only graviton
scatterings, we confirm the planar-limit equivalence with $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.
Our main result is a remarkable universality for the mixed gluon-graviton
scattering amplitudes off D7-branes, obtained from $\partial_\mu^2 \partial_m^2
\log \mathcal{Z}$ and $\partial_\mu^2 \partial_b^2 \log \mathcal{Z}$. We show
that the leading and sub-leading large-$N$ contributions in the strong-coupling
regime are governed by universal asymptotic series, identical to those found
for integrated giant-graviton correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. We also
propose an $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$-invariant completion of these results in
terms of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. This completion provides exact
constraints on higher-derivative terms in the dual $\text{AdS}_5$ brane-string
amplitudes and highlights an unexpected universality across distinct
superconformal theories at strong coupling.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an exceptionally powerful tool for

This progress motivates the application of AI techniques to the analysis of

hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous

perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena
and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the
corresponding strongly correlated systems.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，多行列式 ansatz 在提升变分近似性能方面具有显著优势，且通过直接优化对称化后的状态，可以获得更高的能量。该方法在受 dope 的二维 Hubbard 模型上的应用证实了其有效性。

Abstract: Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is
essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow
(NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions
by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle
orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large
networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size.
Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant
ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant
expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In
particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques,
benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied
to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard
model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo,
and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving
state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected
symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this
technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on
$4\times 16$ and $4 \times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance
extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair
correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.

*Yasser Saleem,Weronika Pasek,Marek Korkusinski,Moritz Cygorek,Pawel Potasz*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: Low-dimensional quantum systems support exotic states like symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains, but inducing the necessary interactions for quantum simulators requires unconventional methods. By introducing spin-1/2 spacers, a biquadratic interaction can be tuned, offering a way to achieve AKLT-like states for quantum simulation. This approach provides a blueprint for constructing practical quantum simulators while respecting microscopic interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling interactions in low-dimensional quantum systems is crucial for developing practical quantum simulators. The AKLT state, while theoretically promising, requires non-standard interactions that are challenging to realize experimentally. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a tunable biquadratic interaction, bringing us closer to real-world applications in quantum simulation.

Method: The study introduces a method to induce a biquadratic interaction between two spin-1 sites by inserting spin-1/2 spacers. The strength of this interaction, denoted by β, is controlled by the ratio of Heisenberg couplings between the main spins and the spacers. This approach allows for precise tuning of interactions, which is essential for achieving desired quantum states like the AKLT state.

Result: The research demonstrates that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, which can be grown using current synthesis techniques, naturally exhibit the spin interactions necessary to approach the AKLT state. This result highlights the potential of this method for constructing practical quantum simulators with unconventional interactions.

Conclusion: This work provides a generalized strategy for inducing and tuning unconventional spin interactions, which could enable the realization of AKLT-like states in bottom-up synthesized quantum simulators. The findings open new possibilities for practical implementations of topological phases in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as
symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains.
Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum
simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However,
many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of
spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally
emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general
strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its
strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$
is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the
spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\beta$
and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of
the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases
with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal
that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which
could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield
precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings
deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up
synthesized quantum simulators.

reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved.
Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moir\'e heavy
fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By
electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase
diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo
coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like
Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi
surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and
discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of
Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong
peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the
Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic
information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moir\'e
semiconductors.

### [50] [Absence of Parity Anomaly in Massive Dirac Fermions on a Lattice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27215)
*Shun-Qing Shen*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in 2D affects quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. While it suggests half-quantized Hall responses in massive Dirac systems, lattice regularization shows that this is not the case. Proper regularization reveals that half-quantized Hall conductivity only appears in the unphysical limit. Realizing a single massive Dirac cone on a lattice leads to integer quantized Hall conductivity, while massless cones give half-quantized Hall conductivity with nonzero longitudinal conductance. Thus, the parity anomaly pertains to massless Dirac fermions in semimetals or metals, not massive Dirac fermions in insulators on a lattice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has profound implications for our understanding of quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. Massless Dirac fermions are known to exhibit unique electronic properties, such as the chiral anomaly, which leads to interesting phenomena like the quantum Hall effect. The half-quantized Hall response observed in systems described by massive Dirac fermions has been a topic of interest, but its validity and physical meaning in the context of lattice regularization have remained unclear. This paper aims to clarify these questions by reexamining the issue of the parity anomaly on a lattice and its implications for the behavior of Dirac fermions in two dimensions.

Method: The authors of the paper re-examined the parity anomaly on a lattice by developing a lattice regularization scheme that properly implements translational invariance. They used techniques from condensed matter physics, such as analyzing the Hall conductivity and longitudinal conductance of systems with massive and massless Dirac fermions on a lattice. By considering the limits of the momentum cutoff, they were able to determine the conditions under which the half-quantized Hall conductivity appears and the implications for the parity anomaly.

Result: The study reveals that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is not a general feature of massive Dirac fermions on a lattice. Instead, it only appears in the unphysical limit of an infinite momentum cutoff, which is not achievable in real physical systems. For massive Dirac fermions on a lattice with a finite momentum cutoff, the Hall conductivity is quantized in integer multiples of e²/h. The half-quantized Hall conductivity appears only for massless Dirac fermions, but even then, it must be accompanied by nonzero longitudinal conductance. This finding suggests that the parity anomaly is a property of massless Dirac fermions in semimetals or metals, rather than massive Dirac fermions in insulators on a lattice.

Conclusion: The parity anomaly is fundamentally a feature of massless Dirac fermions in semimetals or metals. In these systems, the anomaly leads to distinct electronic properties, such as the half-quantized Hall conductivity, which must coexist with nonzero longitudinal conductance. In contrast, for massive Dirac fermions on a lattice, the half-quantized Hall conductivity only appears in the unphysical limit of infinite momentum cutoff, and thus does not represent a physical property of such systems. This conclusion has important implications for our understanding of the parity anomaly and its role in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics.

Abstract: The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has shaped
perspectives in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In condensed
matter it has evolved as a mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in
systems described by massive Dirac fermions. Here we reexamine the issue on a
lattice and show that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for
massive Dirac fermions when lattice regularization is properly implemented and
the translational invariant symmetry is taken into account. We realize that a
single massive Dirac cone on a lattice always leads to an integer quantized
Hall conductivity and to the half-quantized Hall conductivity only in the
unphysical limit of infinite momentum cut-off. The half-quantized Hall
conductivity appears with nonzero longitudinal conductance as a signature of a
single massless Dirac cone on a lattice. Consequently, the parity anomaly is a
property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac
fermions in an insulator on a lattice.

Abstract: We have theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the
quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a
multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We have
employed a four-band model, where each BETS molecule is considered as a site,
and a two-band model, treating each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the
temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around
$T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, indicating a change in the dominant
magnetic fluctuations. Above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, it shows a broad structure
indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, while below
$T_\mathrm{kink}$, the spin susceptibility peaks at a wavevector corresponding
to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations. As the intra-dimer transfer
integral increases, the kink disappears, and the AFM fluctuations are enhanced.
Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, which also report a
change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.

Abstract: Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been
synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the
alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while
conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of
the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo
non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are
mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could
help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long
range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim
of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic
ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of
real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic
and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic
phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate
further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The multiferroic ferroborate GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ with huntite-type structure
exhibits magnetic ordering below T$_N$ = 38 K and contains two magnetic
subsystems associated with Gd and Fe ions. Competing anisotropies of these
subsystems drive a spin reorientation transition at T$_{SR}$ = 10.7 K,
switching the ground state from easy-axis to easy-plane. Using
antiferromagnetic resonance, we investigate the spin dynamics across this
transition. The observed incomplete softening of a magnon mode during both
field- and temperature-induced spin-reorientation transitions indicates the
first-order nature of the phase transition, which is accompanied by a
discontinuous jump in the effective anisotropy field. We reproduce this
behavior using a simple model that attributes the jump in the anisotropy field
to the presence of an effective fourth-order anisotropy constant, responsible
for the discontinuous character of the transition. Remarkably, for in-plane
magnetic fields, we identify a new AFMR mode that persists from 12 K up to
T$_N$. This mode likely corresponds to the dynamics of a long period
incommensurate state, previously detected by resonant elastic X-ray scattering.

Abstract: Multiorbital Hubbard models with Hund coupling and crystal-field splitting
exhibit an instability toward spin-triplet excitonic order in the parameter
regime characterized by strong local spin fluctuations. Upon chemical doping,
two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using
steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that
photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these
excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping
and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator
provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.

Abstract: Spin-dependent dispersion and Rashba effect are manifestations of universal
spin orbit interaction associated with the breaking of the spatial inversion
symmetry in condensed matter and in optical systems. In sharp contrast to this,
we report a spin-split dispersion effect of leaky surface plasmons in an
inversion-symmetric one dimensional plasmonic grating system. In our system,
the signature of spin-momentum locking and the resulting spin-polarization
dependent splitting of dispersion of the surface plasmons are observed through
the leakage radiation detected in a Fourier (momentum) domain optical
arrangement. The setup enables single-shot recording of the full
polarization-resolved dispersion (frequency vs transverse momentum (k)) of the
leaky surface plasmons. Momentum domain polarization analysis identified a
transverse momentum (k) dependent linear birefringence-linear dichroism effect
(referred to as the geometric LB-LD effect) responsible for the observed
spin-split dispersion. This unconventional SOI effect is reminiscent of the
recently reported LB-LD effect resulting in giant chirality in centrosymmetric
crystal, albeit with geometric origin. It is demonstrated that the interplay of
the geometrical polarization transformation in focused polarized light and
subsequent interaction of the structured field polarization with the plasmonic
grating leads to the evolution of strong geometrical phase gradient or
spin(circular polarization)-dependent transverse momentum of light resulting in
spin-split dispersion. Our study offers a new paradigm of spin-based dispersion
engineering and spin-enabled nano-optical functionalities in simple symmetric
metasurfaces using geometric LB-LD effect.

Motivation: 通过对晶圆上 X 截面和 Y 截面干涉图的测量和分析发现，晶圆的 birefringence 值在 X 和 Y 方向均一致，但 substrat 转移过程中存在不均匀性，推测是由于界面缺陷或制备过程引起的。

Result: 使用 custom-built 分光系统测量 GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As 晶圆的相位差一致，但在 substrat 转移过程中存在不均匀性。)}, 

Conclusion: 通过测量和分析，得出的结论是非均匀的 birefringence 是由于 substrat 转移过程中的缺陷或制备过程所引起的。进一步研究表明，这种非均匀性对 LIGO-like 干 Inferometer 的性能影响较小，但未来研究将更加注重制备过程以降低或消除这种不均匀性。

Abstract: Using a custom-built scanning system, we generated maps of birefringence on
reflection at $\lambda=1064$~nm from single-crystal
GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Bragg reflectors (henceforth ``AlGaAs
coatings''). Ten coatings were bonded to fused silica substrates and one
remained on the epitaxial growth wafer. The average phase difference on
reflection between beams polarized along the fast and slow axes of the coating
was found to be $\psi = 1.09 \pm 0.18$~mrad, consistent with values observed in
high-finesse optical reference cavities using similar AlGaAs coatings. Scans of
substrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters
showed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$~mrad. A similar
epitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the
growth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors
tested at $0.02$~mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the
epi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable.
Excluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects,
we conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate
transfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter
loss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity
at the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on
performance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control
to minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel fully programmable linear photonic
processor, which we call LightPro, with improved scalability, performance, and
footprint. At the heart of LightPro are compact, low-loss, and programmable
silicon photonic (SiPh) directional coupler (DC) devices that deploy
phase-change material (PCM) for programming the DC's splitting ratio. By
thermally inducing phase transitions in the PCM, the coupling coefficient of
the DC can be dynamically adjusted to achieve different splitting ratios in the
device output. Building on this device foundation, we develop a neural
architecture search (NAS) and pruning algorithm to optimize the architecture of
the processor for performing MVM operations. Our simulation results show that
LightPro achieves up to an 85% reduction in footprint and more than 50%
improvement in power consumption. In addition, LightPro is evaluated by
performing inference with weight matrices trained on MNIST and linearly
separable Gaussian datasets, showing less than a 5% drop in accuracy when
scaling up the network. Prototyping results, using a commercial photonic
processor (iPronics SmartLight), show LightPro's efficiency and performance
(e.g., computational accuracy) compared to conventional photonic MVM hardware,
demonstrating the experimental evaluation and feasibility of LightPro for
next-generation photonic AI accelerators.

Abstract: The duration of isolated attosecond pulses created via high-order harmonic

Achieving shorter attosecond soft X-ray pulses requires minimizing the number

produces a supercontinuum coherent soft X-ray with unprecedented bandwidth. The
system delivers 50-mJ, 6.7-fs (0.88-cycle) pulses at a center wavelength of
2.26 $\mu$m - over two orders of magnitude more energetic than any previous
sub-cycle laser. We applied the system to high-order harmonic generation and
compared the results to simulations based on the three-dimensional
time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation to identify unique features of sub-cycle
lasers. This work represents a decisive step toward high-energy half-cycle
lasers and high-energy single-digit attosecond soft X-ray pulses that can be
used to probe matter and light-matter interactions at previously inaccessible

TL;DR: In high-Q microresonators, rare quantum electrodynamical (QED) events due to prolonged photon confinement can create distinct Raman signatures, even when QED effects are negligible in classical linear optics. These signatures are amplified by adsorbed analyte amounts, making them detectable experimentally. This effect offers new opportunities for photonic technologies in sensing and spectroscopy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between quantum and classical optical phenomena in microresonators is important for advancing photonic technologies, particularly in sensing and spectroscopy.

Method: The study demonstrates the phenomenon through experiments in high-Q microresonators under varying analyte adsorption, measuring Raman signatures.

Result: Raman fingerprints of coupled analytes are detectable above noise floors, especially as analyte amounts increase.

Conclusion: Extended photon lifetimes in high-Q cavities enable weak-coupling QED effects to be observed, providing new avenues for photonic applications.

Abstract: Classical linear optics posits that at sufficiently low intensities, light
propagation in dielectric media is governed solely by their linear
susceptibilities. Here, we demonstrate a departure from this paradigm in high-Q
microresonators, where prolonged photon confinement enables rare quantum
electrodynamical (QED) events, mediated by the quantum vacuum, to embed
distinctive Raman signatures of the coupled analyte into the resonator's linear
transmission spectrum despite their absence from the linear susceptibility. We
further show that increasing the amount of adsorbed analyte amplifies these
Raman fingerprints well above typical noise floors, rendering them
experimentally accessible with state-of-the-art photonic architectures and
detection schemes. This novel weak-coupling cavity-QED effect offers unique
routes to harness extended photon lifetimes and constrained geometries for
leveraging vacuum fluctuations in next-generation photonic technologies for
chemical and biological sensing and high-precision optical spectroscopy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate temporal scattering in lossless Drude media and reveal an
overlooked role of the zero-frequency flat band associated with static
polarization charge. This flat band forms an exceptional line spanning all
wavenumbers and can be directly excited during temporal scattering at photonic
time interfaces, generating non-propagating static fields alongside the usual
reflected and transmitted waves. Eigenvector coalescence at the corresponding
exceptional points leads to two distinctive features absent in previously
studied systems: a static mode whose amplitude increases linearly with time,
and an additional static component arising from the system's generalized
eigenvector. Remarkably, these effects occur without violating total energy
conservation, underscoring the Hermitian nature of the dynamics. Our findings
present a new physical picture of temporal scattering, sharply distinct from
that in dispersionless and Lorentz-dispersive media.

but classical designs rely on long tapers and narrow bandwidths. In this work,
we present compact, inverse-designed grating couplers with broadband
transmission. We optimized and fabricated arrays of devices and characterized
them with a 4f-scanning setup. The nominal design reached simulated
efficiencies of 52 %, while measurements confirmed robust performance with up
to 32 % efficiency at the target 1540 nm wavelength and 46 % at shifted
wavelengths. Without scaling and contour biasing, the measured efficiency at
the target wavelength drops to only 4.4 %. Thus, a key finding is that
systematic scaling and edge biasing recover up to an eightfold improvement in
efficiency. These inverse-designed grating couplers can be efficiently
corrected post-design, enabling reliable performance despite fabrication
deviations. This approach allows simple layout adjustments to compensate for
process-induced variations, supporting wafer-scale testing, cryogenic photonic
applications, and rapid design wavelength tuning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the role of optical vortices in modern optics and their potential applications.

Method: Review of fundamental concepts and extensive discussion on OAM exploitation in linear and nonlinear optical regimes.

Result: Light fields with OAM have enabled various applications, including microscopy, communication, and quantum science, and show promise for high-capacity data transmission and quantum technologies.

Conclusion: The utilization of OAM in light offers new possibilities for advancing optical technologies.

Abstract: Light is the fundamental medium through which we perceive the world around
us. In the modern era, light can not only be used in its raw form but can also
be used as a versatile tool. Generally, light fields carry energy and momentum
(both linear and angular). Due to the transfer of linear momentum from light to
matter, the radiation pressure is exerted, whereas, the intrinsic spin angular
momentum (SAM) is associated with the polarization states of light. Light
fields embedded with optical orbital angular momentum (OAM) -- also known as
optical vortices or phase singular beams -- have truly revolutionized the field
of optics and extended our basic understanding of the light-matter interaction
process across various scales. Optical vortices -- spatially characterized by
the presence of twisted phase fronts and a central intensity null -- have found
a myriad of applications starting from microparticle trapping and manipulation
to microscopy, optical communication, and quantum information science, among
others. Here, we revisit some of the fundamental concepts on optical vortices
and discuss extensively on how this new dimension of light i.e., the OAM, has
been exploited in both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. We discuss the
different types of vortex beams, the techniques used to generate and detect
their OAM, and their propagation. Particularly, we put a special emphasis on
the utilization of vortex beams in nonlinear regimes to explain different
optical phenomena such as the second harmonic generation, parametric
down-conversion, and high-order harmonic generation. The generation of vortex
beams in the UV to XUV regimes, encoded with higher OAM values, could
potentially extend their application range to areas such as high-capacity data
transmission, stimulated emission depletion microscopy, phase-contrast imaging,
and particle trapping in optical tweezers, among others.

Abstract: Geometry can fundamentally govern the propagation of light, independent of
material constraints. Here, we demonstrate that a fractal phase space, endowed
with a non-Euclidean, scale-dependent geometry, can intrinsically induce
resonance quantization, spatial confinement, and tunable damping without the
need for material boundaries or external potentials. Employing a fractional
formalism with a fixed scaling exponent, we reveal how closed-loop geodesics
enforce constructive interference, leading to discrete resonance modes that
arise purely from geometric considerations. This mechanism enables light to
localize and dissipate in a controllable fashion within free space, with
geometry acting as an effective quantizing and confining agent. Numerical
simulations confirm these predictions, establishing geometry itself as a
powerful architect of wave dynamics. Our findings open a conceptually new and
experimentally accessible paradigm for material-free control in photonic
systems, highlighting the profound role of geometry in shaping fundamental
aspects of light propagation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: X-ray microtomography at synchrotron sources is fundamentally limited by the
high radiation dose applied to the samples, which restricts investigations to
non-native tissue states and thereby compromises the biological relevance of
the resulting data. The limitation stems from inefficient indirect detection
schemes that require prolonged exposures. Efforts to extract additional
contrast through multimodal techniques, like modulation-based imaging, worsen
the problem by requiring multiple tomographic scans. In addition, the
techniques suffer from low modulator pattern visibility, which reduces
measurement efficiency and sensitivity. We address both the detection
efficiency and modulation visibility challenges using a novel setup that
combines an X-ray waveguide, a structured phase modulator, and a
photon-counting detector. Our approach simultaneously achieves near-theoretical
limits in both visibility (95%) and quantum efficiency (98%), thereby enabling
dose-efficient multimodal microtomography at single-micrometer resolution. This
advance will enable new classes of experiments on native-state biological
specimens with the potential to advance biomedical research, disease
diagnostics, and our understanding of tissue structure in physiological
environments.

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates the development of a spin transition control and sensing platform for molecular nanoparticles, enabling real-time manipulation using light, with potential applications in optoelectronics and nanoscale sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase transitions at the nanoscale are essential for advanced nanophotonic devices, but controlling them is challenging. This paper aims to address this issue through innovative use of spin crossover nanoparticles.

Method: A contact-free platform combining a quadrupole Paul trap with a polarization-resolved microscope is used to confine, excite, and monitor spin transitions in levitating nanoparticles.

Result: The system successfully achieves reversible opto-volumetric changes, demonstrating precise single-particle level switching and mechanical control via pressure modulation.

Conclusion: This platform provides a means for real-time, low-power control and sensing of spin states, paving the way for advanced nanophotonic applications such as optical switches and sensors.

Abstract: The ability to control and understand the phase transitions of individual
nanoscale building blocks is key to advancing the next generation of low-power
reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. To address this critical challenge,
molecular nanoparticles (NPs) exhibiting a spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon are
trapped by coupling a quadrupole Paul trap with a multi-spectral
polarization-resolved scattering microscope. This contact-free platform
simultaneously confines, optically excites, and monitors the spin transition in
Fe(II)-triazole NPs in a pressure-tunable environment, eliminating substrate
artifacts. Thus, we show light-driven manipulation of the spin transition in
levitating NPs free from substrate-induced effects. Using the robust spin
bistability near room temperature of our SCO system, we quantify reversible
opto-volumetric changes of up to 6%, revealing precise switching thresholds at
the single-particle level. Independent pressure modulation produces a
comparable size increase, confirming mechanical control over the same bistable
transition. These results constitute full real-time control and readout of spin
states in levitating SCO NPs, charting a route toward their integration into
ultralow-power optical switches, data-storage elements, and nanoscale sensors.

TL;DR: A scalable quantum plasmonic device enabling room-temperature quantum technologies with integrated electric tuning and plasmonic cavities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  room temperature quantum technologies are desirable for scalability and integration with electronic circuits, but achieving strong coupling between quantum emitters and cavities is challenging due to the difficulty of fabricating small mode volumes and precise positioning.

Method:  demonstrate a robust quantum plasmonic device using colloidal quantum dots (Q dots) and plasmonic slit cavities; positioning technique involves dielectrophoresis with real-time photoluminescence feedback, yielding resolvable coupled structures for parallel fabrication.

Result: PL measurements reveal room temp Rabi splitting from coupled systems; devices show variability with Qdot coupling numbers; electrical tuning via quantum-confined Stark effect enables tunability despite room temp spectral diffusion.

Conclusion: The fabrication platform paves the way for scalable, tunable quantum plasmonic devices for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: Strong coupling between quantum emitters and optical cavities is essential
for quantum information processing, high-purity single-photon sources, and
nonlinear quantum devices. Achieving this regime at room temperature in a
compact, deterministic on-chip platform-critical for integration with
nanoelectronic circuitry and scalable device architectures-remains a major
challenge, mainly due to the difficulty of fabricating cavities with
ultra-small mode volumes and precisely positioning quantum emitters. Here, we
demonstrate a robust quantum plasmonic device in which colloidal quantum dots
(Qdots) are strongly coupled to plasmonic slit cavities using a
dielectrophoresis-based positioning technique with real-time photoluminescence
(PL) feedback, providing directly resolvable coupled structures that enable
parallel device fabrication and straightforward integration with additional
optical elements such as waveguides. Our measurements reveal clear PL resolved
Rabi splitting at room temperature with pre characterized cavities, with
variations across devices that scale with the average number of coupled Qdots.
While electrical tuning via the quantum-confined Stark effect is enabled by
integrated electrodes, its impact is largely overshadowed by room-temperature
spectral diffusion. Our results pave the way for scalable, electrically tunable
quantum plasmonic platforms, offering new opportunities for integrated quantum
photonic circuits, active light-matter interactions, and room-temperature
quantum technologies.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a molecular-scale optoelectronic self-oscillatory system using electrically excited plasmons, highlighting its unique behavior and potential applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of self-oscillators is motivated by their intrinsic scientific interest and potential technological applications in optoelectronics and sensing.

Method: Experimental approach includes time-series imaging of photon emission and correlation mapping in gold-naphthalene-2-thiol-EGaIn junctions.

Result: The system exhibits long-lived low-frequency oscillations (1-20 mHz) and transient high-frequency bursts (20-200 mHz), explained by single-molecule resistors following Kirchhoff's laws.

Conclusion: The discovery opens up new possibilities for optoelectronic and sensing systems leveraging molecular-scale self-oscillatory behavior similar to cellular processes.

Abstract: Self-oscillators are intriguing due to their ability to sustain periodic
motion without periodic stimulus. They remain rare as achieving such behavior
requires a balance of energy input, dissipation and non-linear feedback
mechanism. Here, we report a molecular-scale optoelectronic self-oscillatory
system based on electrically excited plasmons. This system generates light via
inelastic electron tunnelling, where electrons lose their energy to molecules
and excite the surface plasmon polaritons that decay radiatively. Time-series
imaging of photon emission in gold-naphthalene-2-thiol-EGaIn junctions,
together with correlation mapping of individual emission spots, reveal
long-lived (~1000 s), low-frequency oscillations (1-20 mHz) interspersed with
transient high-frequency (20-200 mHz) bursts. This behavior can be explained by
attributing individual emission spots to single-molecule resistors that follow
Kirchhoff's circuit laws. Induced by tunnelling current, these individual spots
emit in a correlated way, self-sustaining the overall oscillatory emission from
the whole junction. Our observation is of great interest as it resonates with a
broader understanding of similar molecular-scale dynamic systems such as
picocavities, offering exciting potential for optoelectronic and sensing
applications.

Conclusion: 该成像方法提供了一种鲁棒且有效的方式，克服了传统方法在处理厚且动态散射介质时的不足，为多领域应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Imaging through dynamic scattering media, such as biological tissue, presents
a fundamental challenge due to light scattering and the formation of speckle
patterns. These patterns not only degrade image quality but also decorrelate
rapidly, limiting the effectiveness of conventional approaches, such as those
based on transmission matrix measurements. Here, we introduce an imaging
approach based on second-order correlations and synthetic wavelength holography
(SWH) to enable robust image reconstruction through thick and dynamic
scattering media. By exploiting intensity speckle correlations and using
short-exposure intensity images, our method computationally reconstructs images
from a hologram without requiring phase stability or static speckles, making it
inherently resilient to phase noise. Experimental results demonstrate
high-resolution imaging in both static and dynamic scattering scenarios,
offering a promising solution for biomedical imaging, remote sensing, and
real-time imaging in complex environments.

Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables visualization and quantitative
extraction of the optical phase information of transparent samples. However,
conventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or
complex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase
Gradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method
based on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where
each microlens on the sensor covers a $2\times2$ pixel group. The phase
gradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens,
which lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase
gradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs
quantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a
light-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance
in a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative
phase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a
single acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by
suppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of
quad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI.

TL;DR: The paper investigates how different part morphologies affect laser cutting quality and proposes a method using FMECA to systematically evaluate the influence of part morphology on cutting defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The metallurgical industry's rapid adoption of laser cutting has led to issues with quality control, motivating this study to address the gap in understanding the impact of part morphology on cutting defects.

Method: The study uses a method adapted from Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) to evaluate the criticality of cutting defects across various part morphologies in an industrial context.

Result: The study finds that part morphology significantly influences cutting defects, particularly thermal ones, and proposes design limits for improved industrial processes.

Conclusion: This research provides a framework for evaluating the impact of part morphology on laser cutting quality, offering practical insights for process improvement.

Abstract: Laser cutting is an old and multi-physical process that was quickly adopted
by the metallurgical industry. However, this fast industrialisation has had a
significant impact on quality control. Several studies have been carried out to
characterise and minimise different types of cutting defects. Reviews published
between 2008 and 2022 highlight that research often focuses on single-criterion
___quality' approaches, aiming to minimise specific defects such as the
Heat-Affected Zone, surface roughness, or kerf geometry. Consequently, efforts
have been directed at optimising specific aspects of quality rather than
adopting a complete approach. Furthermore, these reviews reveal that cutting
quality can be enhanced through the careful selection of laser manufacturing
parameters and part parameters. However, while parameters such as material and
thickness have been investigated, the influence of part morphology on cutting
quality remains underexplored.___ Although some studies have examined the
effects of material and thickness, part morphology is often limited to simple
segments with varying cutting lengths or angles. While other research has
investigated the impact of angle size on cutting quality, no established method
exists to systematically determine the influence of each part morphology on
cutting quality.______ In response to this gap, the present study proposes to
evaluate the criticality of cutting defects, as defined by existing standards,
across various part morphologies using a method adapted from Failure Modes,
Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). The objective is to develop a global
approach that examines the influence of all morphologies on all types of
cutting defects. An industrial application shows that cutting defects,
particularly thermal ones, are strongly influenced by morphologies, while
thickness affects them irregularly. Improvement priorities target critical
defects shaped by both factors. Burrs and adherent slag are critical in angles
and arcs, while segments, often used in studies, are less sensitive._________
These observations lead to the definition of design limits. This method offers
a detailed analysis of the influence of design data on quality, providing
practical tools for improving industrial processes._________

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地下实验室进行的CROSS实验旨在探测$^{100}$Mo的无中微子双β衰变，该衰变需要敏感的探测器来观察，而μ子背景是一个主要的干扰因素，特别是在3 MeV的能量区域。因此，安装远程纪系统以减少μ子背景是必要的。

Method: 该研究的方法包括设计、构建和操作CROSS的远程纪系统。系统由四个侧面、一个顶部和四个底部部分组成。采用了专门的蒙特卡洛（MC）模拟来验证系统的有效性，并对触发逻辑进行了优化。

Result: 研究的结果是成功地实现了远程纪系统的稳定运行，平均触发率与蒙特卡洛模拟一致。通过两种μ子触发逻辑，分别结合两种触发策略，能够将μ子引起的事件背景减少到99.2%和99.7%。虽然有18%的死时间，但通过多级触发策略，最终降低了ROI内的μ子背景到约2×10⁻³ cnts/keV/kg/yr，这在高灵敏度的无中微子双β衰变搜索中是可接受的。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了远程纪系统在减少μ子背景方面具有有效性，适用于CROSS实验对$^{100}$Mo无中微子双β衰变高灵敏度探测的需求。系统优化和结合蒙特卡洛模拟确保了良好的性能，尽管存在一些挑战，但整体效果符合预期。

Abstract: In preparation to the CROSS experiment at the Canfranc underground laboratory
(Spain) $-$ aiming to search for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$)
decay of $^{100}$Mo using low-temperature detectors with heat-scintillation
readout $-$ we report on development of a dedicated muon veto system. The need
for the muon veto in CROSS is caused by a comparatively high residual cosmic
muon flux at the experimental site ($\sim$20 $\mu$/m$^2$/h), being a dominant
background in the region of interest (ROI) at $\sim$3 MeV. Thus, we installed
the muon veto system around the CROSS low-background setup, forming four
lateral, one top, and four bottom sectors. In this paper we describe the
design, construction and operation of the CROSS muon veto system, as well as
its optimization and validation by comparing dedicated Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations of muons with low-temperature measurements in the setup. We
demonstrate a stable operation of the veto system with the average trigger
rates compatible with MC simulations. Also, we investigated two muon trigger
logics based on coincidences with either 2 sectors or a single sector of the
veto. The MC study shows that, in combination with the multiplicity cut of
thermal detectors, these trigger logics allow to reject 99.2\% and 99.7\% of
muon-induced events in the ROI, respectively. Despite a comparatively high dead
time ($\sim$18\%) introduced by coincidences with any of nine sectors of the
veto $-$ the adopted strategy $-$ the muon-induced background in the ROI of the
CROSS experiment can be reduced down to $\sim$2 $\times 10^{-3}$
cnts/keV/kg/yr, i.e., an acceptable level compatible with a high-sensitivity
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search foreseen in CROSS.

Abstract: The new Inner Tracking System (ITS2) of the ALICE experiment began operation
in 2021 with the start of LHC Run 3. Compared to its predecessor, ITS2 offers
substantial improvements in pointing resolution, tracking efficiency at low
transverse momenta, and readout-rate capabilities. The detector employs silicon
Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of
26.88$\times$29.24 $\mu$m$^2$ and an intrinsic spatial resolution of
approximately 5 $\mu$m. With a remarkably low material budget of 0.36% of
radiation length ($X_{0}$) per layer in the three innermost layers and a total
sensitive area of about 10 m$^2$, the ITS2 constitutes the largest-scale
application of MAPS technology in a high-energy physics experiment and the
first of its kind operated at the LHC. For stable data taking, it is crucial to
calibrate different parameters of the detector, such as in-pixel charge
thresholds and the masking of noisy pixels. The calibration of 24120 monolithic
sensors, comprising a total of 12.6$\times$10$^{9}$ pixels, represents a major
operational challenge. This paper presents the methods developed for the
calibration of the ITS2 and outlines the strategies for monitoring and
dynamically adjusting the detector's key performance parameters over time.

Abstract: We present here an optimisation and demonstration of a wide band instrument
capable of measuring localised and directionally alternated magnetic fields
below pT in the very high frequency (VHF) range. We take advantage of the
magnon-photon hybridization between a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a
copper resonant cavity to employ a resonant heterodyne detection scheme. The
measurement is near instantaneous due to the strong coupling attained between
magnons and photons.In this work measurements are reported showing a
significant widening of the measurement bandwidth, obtained by tuning the YIG
Larmor frequency with a bias magnetic field and adjusting the magnon-photon
coupling strength. Minimum sensitivity in the sub pT regime is demonstrated in
the range 150 -- 225 MHz at room temperature and expected to go to fT in
cryogenic temperatures. Dynamic range is estimated to be above 100 dB. The
sensitivity is found to be independent on size, being ready to in-chip
miniaturization. Such device can be an important building block to quantum
circuits, such as baluns, transducers or signal processing units.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first derivation and implementation of analytic
gradient methods for the computation of the atomic axial tensors (AATs)
required for simulations of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra using
configuration interaction methods including double (CID) and single and double

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates how metal ions move in porous media under magnetic fields using computer simulations. Two models are compared, and it is found that one better captures the behavior of ions like MnCl2 and ZnCl2 in different concentrations and magnetic fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how ions move in porous materials under magnetic fields is important for applications like water filtration and energy storage.

Method: Multiphysics simulations couple momentum transport, mass diffusion, and magnetic field equations. They use a Stokes-based model and a Brinkman-based model. Both models are compared with recent experiments.

Result: The Brinkman model accurately predicts the transport behavior, while the Stokes model misses some key trends. Paramagnetic and diamagnetic ions form clusters that drive their own and opposite charge ions in different ways.

Conclusion: The study shows that modeling how porous materials affect ion transport is crucial, and that ions can influence each other positively or negatively depending on their magnetic properties.

Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of the magnetophoresis of metal ions in
porous media under static, nonuniform magnetic fields. The multiphysics
simulations couple momentum transport, mass diffusion, and magnetic field
equations, with the porous medium modeled using two distinct approaches: a
Stokes-based formulation incorporating effective diffusivity, and a
Brinkman-based formulation that explicitly accounts for permeability and
medium-induced drag. Comparison with recent experimental data [Nwachuwku et al.
Submitted, 2025] reveals that the Stokes model partially fails to capture key
trends, while the Brinkman model, with permeability accurately reproduces
observed transport behavior on various porous media. Our simulations predict
that both paramagnetic (MnCl2) and diamagnetic (ZnCl2) ions may form
field-induced clusters under magnetic gradients over a range of concentrations
of 1mM-100mM and magnetic field gradients of up to 100 T2/m. The dominant
driving force is found to be the magnetic gradient (Kelvin) force, while the
paramagnetic force from concentration gradients contributes minimally. In
binary mixtures, hydrodynamic interactions between paramagnetic and diamagnetic
clusters significantly alter transport dynamics. Specifically, paramagnetic
clusters can pull diamagnetic clusters along the magnetic field gradient,
enhancing diamagnetic migration and suppressing the motion of paramagnetic
species. These findings highlight the importance of porous media modeling and
interspecies interactions in predicting magnetophoretic transport of ionic
mixtures.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of three reference equations of state
(EoS), AGA8-DC92, GERG-2008, and SGERG-88, in predicting the density of
regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) mixtures. A synthetic nine-component
RLNG mixture was gravimetrically prepared. High-precision density measurements
were obtained using a single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter over a
temperature range of (250 to 350) K and pressures up to 20 MPa. The
experimental data were compared with EoS predictions to evaluate their
accuracy. AGA8-DC92 and GERG-2008 showed excellent agreement with the
experimental data, with deviations within their stated uncertainty. In
contrast, SGERG-88 exhibited significantly larger deviations for this RLNG
mixture, particularly at low temperatures of (250 to 260) K, where
discrepancies reached up to 3 %. Even at 300 K, deviations larger than 0.4 %
were observed at high pressures, within the model's uncertainty, but notably
higher than those of the other two EoSs. The analysis was extended to three
conventional 11-component natural gas mixtures (labeled G420 NG, G431 NG, and
G432 NG), previously studied by our group using the same methodology. While
SGERG-88 showed reduced accuracy for the RLNG mixture, it performed reasonably
well for these three mixtures, despite two of them have a very similar
composition to the RLNG. This discrepancy is attributed to the lower CO2 and N2
content typical in RLNG mixtures, demonstrating the sensitivity of EoS
performance to minor differences in composition. These findings highlight the
importance of selecting appropriate EoS models for accurate density prediction
in RLNG applications.

TL;DR: Approximate natural orbitals can enhance the efficiency of neural-network-assisted configuration interaction calculations by reducing the required determinants for a given accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve the efficiency of configuration interaction calculations by proposing a method that utilizes approximate natural orbitals.

Method: The authors propose using approximate natural orbitals, which are eigenfunctions of the one-particle density matrix, as an alternative to canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals. They employ a neural-network-assisted approach to identify relevant Slater determinants.

Result: The study demonstrates that approximate natural orbitals reduce the number of required determinants for a given accuracy in the computed correlation energy.

Conclusion: The results confirm that approximate natural orbitals offer a simple yet powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of neural-network-assisted configuration interaction calculations.

Abstract: Selective configuration interaction methods approximate correlated molecular
ground- and excited states by considering only the most relevant Slater
determinants in the expansion. While a recently proposed
neural-network-assisted approach efficiently identifies such determinants, the
procedure typically relies on canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals, which are
optimized only at the mean-field level. Here we assess approximate natural
orbitals - eigenfunctions of the one-particle density matrix computed from
intermediate many-body eigenstates - as an alternative. Across our benchmarks
for H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CO, and C$_3$H$_8$ we see a consistent reduction in the
required determinants for a given accuracy of the computed correlation energy
compared to full configuration interaction calculations. Our results confirm
that even approximate natural orbitals constitute a simple yet powerful
strategy to enhance the efficiency of neural-network-assisted configuration
interaction calculations.

Abstract: High-precision measurements of the fine-structure splittings in helium high

$m\alpha^4$- and $m\alpha^5$-order contributions, the singlet-triplet mixing
effect, and estimated spin-dependent $m\alpha^6$-order corrections obtained
using a $1/n^3$ scaling approximation. High-precision ab initio results are
obtained for principal quantum numbers $n=24$-37 with kilohertz-level accuracy
and further extended to $n=45$-51 by extrapolation and fitting. The theoretical
results show excellent agreement with quantum-defect theory (QDT) predictions

TL;DR: The paper discusses the remarkable durability of circular Rydberg atoms, achieved through Purcell suppression, which enhances their lifetimes by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional Rydberg states. This discovery opens up new possibilities for quantum computing, sensing, and other precision-based applications in quantum information science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increased lifetime of Rydberg atoms is critical for advancing quantum technologies, as longer lifetimes reduce decoherence and improve computational and sensing capabilities.

Method: The researchers engineered circular Rydberg states with high angular momentum and demonstrated their enhanced stability through Purcell suppression, a technique that reduces radiative decay by limiting photon emission into a small spatial region.

Result: They successfully trapped and manipulated individual circular Rydberg atoms at principal quantum numbers as high as n=103, observing lifetimes exceeding 10 milliseconds, which is two orders of magnitude longer than previously reported low angular momentum Rydberg states.

Conclusion: This breakthrough offers a promising path for advancing quantum technologies by leveraging the exceptional stability of high-energy Rydberg atoms with circular states.

Abstract: Stability achieved by large angular momentum is ubiquitous in nature, with
examples ranging from classical mechanics, over optics and chemistry, to
nuclear physics. In atoms, angular momentum can protect excited electronic
orbitals from decay due to selection rules. This manifests spectacularly in
highly excited Rydberg states. Low angular momentum Rydberg states are at the
heart of recent breakthroughs in quantum computing, simulation and sensing with
neutral atoms. For these applications the lifetime of the Rydberg levels sets
fundamental limits for gate fidelities, coherence times, or spectroscopic
precision. The quest for longer Rydberg state lifetimes has motivated the
generation, coherent control and trapping of circular Rydberg atoms, which are
characterized by the maximally allowed electron orbital momentum and were key
to Nobel prize-winning experiments with single atoms and photons. Here, we
report the observation of individually trapped circular Rydberg atoms with
lifetimes of more than 10 milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer-lived
than the established low angular momentum orbitals. This is achieved via
Purcell suppression of blackbody modes at room temperature. We coherently
control individual circular Rydberg levels at so far elusive principal quantum
numbers of up to $n=103$, and observe tweezer trapping of the Rydberg atoms on
the few hundred millisecond scale. Our results pave the way for quantum
information processing and sensing utilizing the combination of extreme
lifetimes and giant Rydberg blockade.

Motivation: Complexity of cold molecular ion experiments requires automation to maintain high duty cycles and efficient measurements.

Method: The system uses adaptive feedback routines, real-time image analysis, and quantum-logic-based methods for atom trapping and manipulation.

Result: The control system significantly increases the number of experimental cycles and loaded molecules, enhancing productivity.

Conclusion: Automation is essential for scaling up molecular-ion experiments to handle more complex protocols efficiently.

Abstract: Modern experiments with cold molecular ions have reached a high degree of
complexity requiring frequent sample preparation, state initialization and
protocol execution while demanding precise control over multiple devices and
laser sources. To maintain a high experimental duty cycle and robust
measurement conditions, automation becomes essential. We present a fully
automated control system for the preparation of trapped state-selected
molecular ions and subsequent quantum logic-based experiments. Adaptive
feedback routines based on real-time image analysis introduce and identify
single molecular ions in atomic-ion Coulomb crystals. By appropriate
manipulation of the trapping potentials, excess atomic ions are released from
the trap to produce dual-species two-ion strings, here Ca$^+-$N$_2^+$. After
mass and state identification of the molecular ion, nanosecond-level
synchronization of laser pulses employing the Sinara/ARTIQ framework and
real-time data analysis enable quantum-logic-spectroscopic measurements. The
present automated control system enables robust, unsupervised operation over
extended periods resulting in an increase of the number of experimentation
cycles by about a factor of ten compared to manual operation and a factor of
about eight in loaded molecules in typical practical situations. The modular,
distributed design of the system provides a scalable blueprint for similar
molecular-ion experiments.

Abstract: Particle accelerators play a pivotal role in advancing scientific research,
yet optimizing beamline configurations to maximize particle transmission
remains a labor-intensive task requiring expert intervention. In this work, we
introduce RLABC (Reinforcement Learning for Accelerator Beamline Control), a
Python-based library that reframes beamline optimization as a reinforcement
learning (RL) problem. Leveraging the Elegant simulation framework, RLABC
automates the creation of an RL environment from standard lattice and element
input files, enabling sequential tuning of magnets to minimize particle losses.
We define a comprehensive state representation capturing beam statistics,
actions for adjusting magnet parameters, and a reward function focused on
transmission efficiency. Employing the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(DDPG) algorithm, we demonstrate RLABC's efficacy on two beamlines, achieving
transmission rates of 94% and 91%, comparable to expert manual optimizations.
This approach bridges accelerator physics and machine learning, offering a
versatile tool for physicists and RL researchers alike to streamline beamline
tuning.

Abstract: Plasma processing of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities has been
an active research effort at Jefferson Lab (JLab) since 2019, aimed at
enhancing cavity performance by removing hydrocarbon contaminants and reducing
field emission. In this experiment, processing using argon-oxygen and
helium-oxygen gas mixtures to find minimum ignition power at different cavity
pressure was investigated. Ongoing simulations are contributing to a better
understanding of the plasma surface interactions and the fundamental physics
behind the process. These simulations, combined with experimental studies,
guide the optimization of key parameters such as gas type, RF power, and
pressure to ignite plasma using selected higher-order mode (HOM) frequencies.
This paper presents experimental data from argon-oxygen and helium-oxygen gas
mixture C75 and C100 cavity plasma ignition studies, as well as simulation
results for the C100-type cavity based on the COMSOL model previously applied
to the C75 cavity.

Abstract: A huge interesting progress in the field of organic electronic materials and
devices has been observed in the last decade. However, the understanding of
these materials is still a challenge to overcome. Most studies in literature
focus on active devices such as OTFTs, OLEDs and OPVs. Nevertheless, a complete
technology has to have also passive devices in order to allow the design of
interesting applications and complex circuits. This paper deals with the
development of a complete set of passive devices allowing the fabrication of
simple applications such as filters or sensors. The process flow is a fully
screen printed technology that uses exclusively organic materials on gold laser
ablated flexible substrate. Discrete passive (R, L, C) devices have been
processed and characterized. This has permitted the fabrication of RLC low-band
pass filters that are dedicated to RF applications, typically around 1GHz.
Furthermore, based on these discrete passive components, we have developed a
sensitive sensor on flexible substrate for RFID applications. We present the
state of the art of our process development for RF applications using organic
materials.

Abstract: The built-in potential of p-n junctions plays a critical role in charge
separation, which is fundamental to the photovoltaic effect. However, the
conventional classical theory of photovoltaic effect in p-n junctions typically
does not account for the quantitative influence of the built-in potential. In
this study, we revisit the classical theory and propose an improved analytic
expression of photocurrent by applying more accurate boundary conditions. Our
improved expression reveals that the photocurrent comprises of two components:
the conventional photocurrent and a previously unrecognized backward
photocurrent. Latter reduces the total photocurrent, yet it has not been
discussed in prior literature. The essential role of the built-in potential is
to suppress this backward current. Furthermore, our improved expression of
photocurrent predicts that the photocurrent vanishes under certain forward bias
conditions. This prediction is experimentally validated using a commercial
silicon solar cell, confirming the direct impact of the built-in potential on
photocurrent behavior.

TL;DR: Programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models on quantum hardware is providing a new tool to study strongly correlated quantum systems beyond exact classical simulation limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum systems, especially those with strong correlations, is a key challenge in modern physics. Quantum computers have the potential to simulate these systems more effectively than classical computers.

Method: The researchers implemented simulations of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on Google's quantum processor using 72 qubits. They studied various phenomena such as magnetic polarons, symmetry breaking, and thermalization.

Result: The results show that programmable digital quantum simulation is gaining traction and is now competitive with classical methods despite quantum hardware being in early stages of development.

Conclusion: The success of these simulations on current quantum hardware suggests that this is one of the promising directions for future quantum computing research.

Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original
use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of
quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and
molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising
applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the
parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity
output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a
scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency
of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate
programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard
model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline
solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement
simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on
Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters,
including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and
study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers
surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in
stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state
known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through
thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter
regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical
simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods.
Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of
many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art
quantum hardware.

### [94] [The Particle in a Box in Koopman--von Neumann Mechanics: A Hilbert Space representation of Classical Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26856)
*Abhijit Sen,Lev Kaplan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines the 'particle in a box' problem from the perspective of classical KvN mechanics instead of quantum mechanics, revealing that energy quantization does not arise due to hard walls when proper boundary conditions are applied.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a fundamental question in physics: the lack of energy quantization in classical systems confined by hard walls, challenging the common understanding that such systems must exhibit discrete energy levels as in quantum mechanics.

Method: The authors use Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, a framework for describing classical dynamics in a Hilbert space, to analyze the 'particle in a box' system. They impose specific boundary conditions to model elastic reflections and show how these affect the energy spectrum.

Result: The analysis concludes that when elastic boundary conditions are correctly applied, the KvN framework for a particle in a box yields a continuous energy spectrum, directly demonstrating that energy quantization is not a necessary feature of classical systems confined by hard walls.

Conclusion: This study corrects common misconceptions about energy quantization in classical systems and provides a rigorous demonstration within the KvN framework that energy levels are continuous for a particle confined between two ideal, ideally elastic walls.

Abstract: This paper revisits the textbook 'particle in a box', but from the point of
view of Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) mechanics. KvN mechanics is a way to describe
\emph{classical} dynamics in a Hilbert space. That simple fact changes the
usual expectation: hard walls do \emph{not} force energy quantization here. We
show, in a clear and physical way, why a KvN particle confined between two
ideal walls still has a continuous range of energies. With the correct wall
condition, one that captures ordinary elastic reflection rather than 'vanishing
at the boundary,' the KvN description naturally produces spatial confinement
without discrete energy levels. Beyond establishing this result, we also clean
up common misunderstandings: for example, treating the KvN wavefunction like a
quantum probability amplitude in position alone leads to the wrong boundary
picture and, with it, the wrong conclusion about quantization.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization
but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce
Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The
algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using
fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark
the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances
on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems
ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm
against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE)
algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that
Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as
high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We
evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor
network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential
for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Highly efficient single-photon-level light storage and retrieval using atomic frequency combs in rubidium vapor achieves coherence with weak coherent states and potential for polarization qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Light storage and retrieval for quantum applications like qubits and combats decoherence.

Method: AT Totally absorbs light at specific frequencies due to atomic transitions. The rubidium vapor's F=2 state matches photon frequencies. Velocity-selective pumping populates the comb. Weak states with low photon number are stored and retrieved with high efficiency.

Result: Achieved acquisition time of 7.5 ns with 6.59% efficiency. Two distinct modes with 2.6% efficiency support qubit storage. Efficiency independent of input polarization, enabling polarization qubits.

Conclusion: The method paves the way for advanced quantum information processing with rubidium vapor and combinatorial light storage.

Abstract: We have demonstrated the coherent storage and retrieval of
single-photon-level light using the atomic frequency comb protocol in a room
temperature rubidium vapour. Velocity-selective optical pumping is used to
prepare the comb within the $F=2$ hyperfine ground state of rubidium, with the
spacing between peaks coinciding with half the $F = 2 - F =3$ hyperfine
splitting of the $5^2$P$_{3/2}$ excited state. Weak coherent states of average
photon number $\mu_\mathrm{in} = 0.083(5)$ are stored with pre-programmed
recall time of $7.5\,$ns with an efficiency of $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} =
6.59(5)\,\%$, while two temporally distinct modes have been stored and recalled
with $\eta_{\textrm{AFC}} = 2.6(1)\,\%$, allowing for time-bin qubit storage.
Finally, the efficiency is observed to be independent of the input pulse
polarisation, paving the way for polarisation qubit storage.

### [98] [Exact and approximate conditions of tabletop reversibility: when is Petz recovery cost-free?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26895)
*Minjeong Song,Hyukjoon Kwon,Valerio Scarani*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study examines the conditions under which the Petz recovery map can reversibly implement a noisy quantum channel, termed tabletop time-reversible (TTR), and explores variants like approximate and Lindbladian TTR conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the reversibility of quantum dynamics is fundamental in quantum information science, particularly in error correction and resource recovery.

Method: The research systematically evaluates exact TTR conditions, introduces time-sensitive control in approximate TTR, and develops Lindbladian TTR under a random-time model.

Result: The findings reveal distinct scenarios enabling TTR, Proposing both controlled and autonomous approaches for recovery.

Conclusion: This work deepens our understanding of quantum channel reversibility, providing practical insights for resource-efficient quantum information processing.

Abstract: Channels $\mathcal{N}$ that describe open quantum dynamics are inherently
irreversible: it is impossible to undo their effect completely, but one can
study partial recovery of the information. The Petz recovery map
$\hat{\mathcal{N}}_{\gamma}^{(\texttt{P})}$ is a systematic construction that
depends only on $\mathcal{N}$ and on a reference state $\gamma$, which will be
recovered exactly. If the real input state was different from $\gamma$, the
recovery is partial, with a guarantee of near-optimality. Generically, an
implementation of the Petz recovery map would look very different from the
implementation of the channel. It is natural to study under which conditions
the two maps require similar or even identical resources. The noisy forward
channel $\mathcal{N}$ is called ``tabletop time-reversible'' for a given
$\gamma$ when the corresponding Petz recovery map is realizable in such a way.
First, we study the exact tabletop reversibility (TTR) conditions. We show in
particular that a time-sensitive control of an ancilla system is needed.
Second, we present the approximate TTR conditions, which do not require such a
time-sensitive control. Third, we derive Lindbladian TTR conditions under a
random-time collision model.

Abstract: We present a single-photon transduction scheme using 4-wave-mixing and
quantum scattering in planar, cooperative Rydberg arrays that is both efficient
and highly directional and may allow for terahertz-to-optical transduction. In
the 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the
system in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in
the terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The
photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective
super-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition.
As the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident
signal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar
idler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture
is into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific,
highly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane.
Outside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum
devices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive
resonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and
obtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict
transduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while
the overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for
finite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes
that narrow as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Our scheme combines the broadband acceptance of
free-space 4-wave mixing with the efficiency, directionality and tunability of
cooperative metasurfaces, offering a route towards quantum-coherent THz
detection and processing for astronomical spectroscopy, quantum-networked
sparse-aperture imaging and other quantum-sensing applications.

### [100] [Harnessing Floquet dynamics for selective metrology in few-qubit systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26942)
*Asghar Ullah,Hasan Mermer,Melih Özkurt,Igor Lesanovsky,Özgür E. Müstecaplıoğlu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 在有限尺寸的Floquet量子系统中，周期性驱动的量子系统可以作为高度选择性参数滤波器。我们展示了在由横场Ising模型描述的三量子比特系统中，这种能力。在这个系统中，我们识别了一个发生倍频（PD）的动态相，在该相中，对施加在量子比特上的磁场和对量子比特间耦合强度的敏感度存在显著差异。PD相源于π对，即初始状态具有强的π对Floquet本征态叠加，导致倍频动力学和增强的 metrological 敏感度。通过量子 Fisher 信息分析发现，PD相显著提高对 Ising 交互强度的估计精度，同时抑制对横场磁感应的敏感性。与此相反，非-PD相更适合对横场磁感应的敏感度。这种过滤效应对于更大的系统尺寸是稳健的，并且可以利用实验可访问的可观测量（如磁化率和两量子比特相关性）通过经典 Fisher 信息进行量化。我们的研究表明，有限尺寸的 Floquet 系统中的不同动态阶段可以被用于目标导向的量子测量。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过控制有限尺寸Floquet系统的动态阶段，可以针对特定参数进行高精度的量子测量。这为量子测量技术的发展提供了新的思路和可能的应用方向。

Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems can function as highly selective
parameter filters. We demonstrate this capability in a finite-size, three-qubit
system described by the transverse-field Floquet Ising model. In this system,
we identify a period-doubling (PD) dynamical phase that exhibits a stark
asymmetry in metrological sensitivity to the magnetic field applied on the
qubits and to the coupling strength between the qubits. The PD phase originates
from $\pi$-pairing, where the initial state exhibits strong overlap with
$\pi$-paired Floquet eigenstates, leading to robust period-doubled dynamics and
enhanced metrological sensitivity. The analysis of quantum Fisher information
reveals that the PD regime significantly enhances precision for estimating the
Ising interaction strength while simultaneously suppressing sensitivity to the
transverse magnetic field. Conversely, non-PD regimes are optimal for sensing
the transverse field. This filtering effect is robust for larger system sizes
and is quantifiable using experimentally accessible observables, such as
magnetization and two-qubit correlations, via the classical Fisher information.
Our work shows that distinct dynamical regimes in finite-size Floquet systems
can be harnessed for targeted quantum sensing.

*Abhishek Muhuri,Tanoy Kanti Konar,Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju,Aditi Sen De*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper shows that the Bell operator can detect dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) in a long-range XY spin chain after a sudden quench. The Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins shows a distinct drop at critical boundaries. Two quenching protocols are considered: sudden changes in magnetic field and interaction fall-off rate. The behavior distinguishes between intra-phase and inter-phase quenches, regardless of long-range interaction strength, anisotropy, or system size. Conventional classical and quantum correlators, like entanglement, fail to capture this transition during dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum phase transitions and their dynamics is crucial in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory. Detecting DQPTs, which occur during nonequilibrium dynamics, is challenging, and this work provides a novel method using the Bell operator.

Method: The authors study a long-range XY spin chain under a magnetic field. They perform sudden quenches by changing either the magnetic field or the interaction fall-off rate and monitor the Bell operator's behavior between nearest-neighbor spins over time.

Result: The Bell operator exhibits a distinct drop at DQPT critical boundaries. The behavior is protocol-dependent, distinguishing between intra-phase and inter-phase quenches. The results are robust against variations in long-range interaction strength, anisotropy, and system size. Conventional correlators like entanglement fail to capture the DQPT dynamics.

Conclusion: The Bell operator is an effective witness for DQPTs in long-range spin systems. The protocol-dependent behavior provides a clear signature for identifying DQPTs, and the findings are generalizable across different system parameters.

Abstract: Identifying equilibrium criticalities and phases from the dynamics of a
system, known as a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), is a challenging
task when relying solely on local observables. We exhibit that the
experimentally accessible two-body Bell operator, originally designed to detect
nonlocal correlations in quantum states, serves as an effective witness of
DQPTs in a long-range (LR) XY spin chain subjected to a magnetic field, where
the interaction strength decays as a power law. Following a sudden quench of
the system parameters, the Bell operator between nearest-neighbor spins
exhibits a distinct drop at the critical boundaries. In this study, we consider
two quenching protocols, namely sudden quenches of the magnetic field strength
and the interaction fall-off rate. This pronounced behavior defines a
threshold, distinguishing intra-phase from inter-phase quenches, remaining
valid regardless of the strength of long-range interactions, anisotropy, and
system sizes. Comparative analyses further demonstrate that conventional
classical and quantum correlators, including entanglement, fail to capture this
transition during dynamics.

*Emil Otis Rosanowski,Jurek Eisinger,Lena Funcke,Ulrich Poschinger,Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A novel quantum-classical algorithm, SKQD, is used to study lattice gauge theories with a θ-term. The algorithm efficiently captures the ground state and its dependence on θ in the Schwinger model. It performs well on different quantum processors, potentially enabling larger-scale simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simulating lattice gauge theories is challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space with volume. Quantum algorithms like SKQD offer potential to mitigate this issue.

Method: The SKQD method constructs a Krylov space using bitstrings sampled from quantum states, then classically diagonalizes the Hamiltonian within this subspace.

Result: SKQD shows promising results, capturing the phase structure of the Schwinger model with θ-term accurately. The algorithm's performance is consistent across trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors.

Conclusion: SKQD is a promising approach for simulating lattice gauge theories, offering a way to handle larger volumes where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: We apply the recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization
(SKQD) method to lattice gauge theories, using the Schwinger model with a
$\theta$-term as a benchmark. SKQD approximates the ground state of a
Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a
Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii)
classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the
dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the
$\theta$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm
is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors,
demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD
substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov
space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its
promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we analytically derive a semi-classical equation of motion
describing the zitterbewegung effects arising in the dynamics of wavepackets in
non-Hermitian systems. In Hermitian non-relativistic quantum systems, the
zitterbewegung effects can arise due to the spin precession and spin-orbit
coupling. Interestingly, the spin dynamics in non-Hermitian systems are
qualitatively different because of the effective nonlinear terms induced by the
non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show the effects from
the non-Hermitian spin dynamics by generalising the description of
zitterbewegung effects to non-Hermitian systems. We also uncover novel
non-Hermitian correction to the group velocity, which can be expressed in terms
of the non-Hermitian quantum metric tensor in the absence of out-of-plane
effective field.

*I. D. Moore,B. M. White,B. Graner,J. D. Siverns*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new technique called 'electron juggling' to enhance photonic interconnects in trapped-ion quantum computers, significantly reducing the time needed for state preparation and increasing the rate of generating entangled Bell pairs to over 1,000 per second.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency of photonic interconnects is crucial for scaling up quantum computing systems, as such interconnects enable the interconnection of multiple quantum processing units, facilitating the execution of more complex and longer algorithms. Traditional methods involve state preparation, excitation, and detection of photons, which are time-consuming and limit the overall performance of the system.

Method: The 'electron juggling' technique proposed in this paper aims to reduce the time spent on preparing quantum states by leveraging the movement of electrons between ions in a way that allows for faster transitions and photon emissions. This method supposedly bypasses some of the traditional bottlenecks in state preparation by optimizing the interaction between ions and photons through strategic electron movements.

Result: The analysis shows that implementing 'electron juggling' can substantially increase the remote entanglement generation rates of trapped-ion photonic interconnects. Specifically, the theoretical framework presented in the paper suggests that such systems can achieve rates surpassing 1,000 Bell pairs per second, which represents a significant improvement over current methods.

Conclusion: The success of 'electron juggling' in this paper paves the way for more efficient quantum photonic interconnects, bringing us closer to the goal of high-speed, large-scale quantum computing systems.

Abstract: Photonic interconnects are a key technology for scaling up atomic based
quantum computers. By facilitating the connection of multiple systems,
high-performance modular quantum processing units may be constructed to perform
deeper and more useful algorithms. Most previous implementations of photonic
interconnects in trapped ions utilize the scheme of preparing a state, exciting
it, and collecting single photons from decays of the excited state. State
preparation is responsible for the vast majority of the total attempt time,
often taking hundreds of nanoseconds to several microseconds. Here, we describe
and analyze a novel technique called ``electron juggling" to speed up photonic
interconnects by reducing the state preparation step substantially. Using a
theoretical framework, we illustrate how this scheme can significantly increase
remote entanglement generation rates, approaching the atomic physics limit of
the attempt rate in trapped-ion photonic interconnects. Our results indicate
that this scheme holds the possibility of achieving remote entanglement
generation rates of over 1,000 Bell pairs per second.

TL;DR: This paper presents

significant reductions in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bosonic quantum error correction codes are essential building blocks
for scalable quantum computers. However, state preparation speed is a
bottleneck. This paper aims to address this issue through improved
protocol design.

Method: The researchers developed a protocol involving multiphoton
interactions between oscillators and auxiliary qubits. They used a
generalized protocol to prepare rotationally-symmetric oscillator states.
Numerical simulations incorporating realistic parameters were used to
validate the approach.

Result: The protocol reduces preparation
time significantly compared
to existing methods. Simulations
demonstrate that the protocol is
robust against qubit and
oscillator relaxation and
dephasing.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for
more efficient and reliable
bosonic quantum error
correction codes, crucial for
scalable fault-tolerant quantum
systems.

Abstract: We present a protocol for preparing oscillator states with $n$-fold
rotational symmetry, which include many logical codewords for bosonic quantum
error correction codes. The protocol relies on a multiphoton interaction
between the oscillator and an auxiliary qubit. Further, we achieve arbitrary
control over the oscillator's Hilbert space by using a combination of different
multiphoton interaction orders. We also discuss the preparation of
rotationally-symmetric multi-oscillator states using a generalized variant of
the protocol. We show that the use of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions
can substantially reduce the state preparation time, in comparison to the
linear qubit-oscillator interactions that are usually employed. Furthermore, we
perform numerical simulations that take into account qubit and oscillator
relaxation and dephasing using realistic planar superconducting circuit
parameters that validate the robustness of our protocol. Our findings can
significantly improve the performance of bosonic codes on planar
superconducting hardware, which are an almost inevitable necessity for scalable
bosonic fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.

Motivation: Understanding the structural properties of quantum internet networks is crucial for optimizing their performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposed new models incorporating heterogeneity in node connections to analyze network metrics such as degree distribution, average clustering coefficient, average shortest path, and assortativity.

Result: Heterogeneous networks better capture the essential characteristics of real optical fiber networks, including degree distribution, assortativity, and hierarchical behavior, enhancing the understanding of network structure's impact on quantum communication.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that network topology plays a significant role in quantum communication, offering more realistic models for quantum internet infrastructure, which is essential for advancing research in this field.

Abstract: Quantum communication is a growing area of research, with quantum internet
being one of the most promising applications. Studying the statistical
properties of this network is essential to understanding its connectivity and
the efficiency of the entanglement distribution. However, the models proposed
in the literature often assume homogeneous distributions in the connections of
the optical fiber infrastructure, without considering the heterogeneity of the
network. In this work, we propose new models for the quantum internet that
incorporate this heterogeneity of node connections in the optical fiber
network, analyzing how this characteristic influences fundamental metrics such
as the degree distribution, the average clustering coefficient, the average
shortest path and assortativity. Our results indicate that, compared to
homogeneous models, heterogeneous networks efficiently reproduce key structural
properties of real optical fiber networks, including degree distribution,
assortativity, and hierarchical behavior. These findings highlight the impact
of network structure on quantum communication and can contribute to more
realistic modeling of quantum internet infrastructure.

TL;DR: The paper discusses reflection and transmission measurements of two-photon and four-photon Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), incorporating interference effects between inter-level transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding and analyzing the behavior of KPOs in terms of reflection and transmission measurements.

Method: The authors use theoretical modeling and extend previous work by considering the interaction between inter-level transitions and off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, which were previously neglected.

Result: The research finds that interference among these transitions modifies the spectrum and identifies the conditions under which this occurs as well as the influence of off-diagonal elements of the density matrix.

Conclusion: This work provides an optimized approach for the design and application of KPOs in various quantum optics systems.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate reflection and transmission measurements of
two-photon and four-photon Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), introducing
interference effects between inter-level transitions. Due to the level
degeneracy of a KPO, a probe field can be resonant with multiple inter-level
transitions. We extend the previous theory of reflection measurements by
incorporating the interaction between inter-level transitions and off-diagonal
elements of the density matrix which had previously been neglected. We
demonstrate that interference among these transitions substantially modifies
the spectrum. We identify the conditions for the interference, as well as those
under which the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix affect the
spectrum. The theory is also generalized to transmission measurements, and is
applicable to a broad class of systems beyond KPOs.

Method: 利用Koopman-von Neumann（KvN）形式的量子力理解释 classical dynamics。研究通过引入λ参数作为投影流来连结所有三个动力学。

Result: KvN的经典Hilbert空间形式自然出现为λ→1极限下的随机σ-λ框架。

Conclusion: 连续参数λ将量子、随机和经典力学整合为一个单一的框架。

Abstract: Nelson's stochastic mechanics links quantum mechanics to an underlying
Brownian motion with the identification $\hbar = m\sigma$. Ghose's
interpolating equation introduces a continuous parameter $\lambda$ that
suppresses the quantum potential $Q[\psi]$ and yields a smooth transition
between quantum ($\lambda=0$) and classical ($\lambda=1$) regimes. In this
short note, we show that the Koopman--von Neumann (KvN) Hilbert-space
formulation of classical mechanics emerges naturally as the $\lambda \to 1$
limit of this stochastic $\sigma$--$\lambda$ hierarchy. The KvN phase-space
amplitude provides an operator representation of the classical Liouville
equation, while the $\lambda$ parameter acts as a projection flow from the
complex projective Hilbert manifold $\mathbb{C}P^n$ to its classical quotient
$\mathbb{C}P^*/U(1)$, implementing phase superselection. This unified picture
links quantum, stochastic, and classical dynamics within a single continuous
framework.

Conclusion: 扩展了共轭单调性 Entanglement 的条件，增加了可应用于多态的可能性.)

Abstract: Unlike classical correlations, entanglement cannot be freely shared among
multiple parties. This unique feature of quantum systems is known as the
monogamy of entanglement. While it holds for all multipartite pure states, its
converse -- weak entanglement between two parties enforces strong entanglement
with a third party -- occurs only under specific conditions. In particular,
Hayashi and Chen [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{84}, 012325 (2011)] demonstrated a
qualitative version of the converse monogamy of entanglement (CMoE) for
tripartite pure states by employing a hierarchy of bipartite entanglement
defined through the relations among various separability criteria, and Singh
and Datta [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory \textbf{69}, 6564 (2023)] later extended
this notion of the CMoE from the viewpoint of distillability under one-way or
two-way classical communication. In this work, we extend their results to the
CMoE with broader conditions, and furthermore show that our extensions are
maximal with respect to the hierarchies they considered.

Abstract: Scalable quantum computing requires modular multi-chip architectures
integrating multiple quantum cores interconnected through quantum-coherent and
classical links. The classical communication subsystem is critical for
coordinating distributed control operations and supporting quantum protocols
such as teleportation. In this work, we consider a realization based on a
wireless network-on-chip for implementing classical communication within
cryogenic environments. Traditional token-based medium access control (MAC)
protocols, however, incur latency penalties due to inefficient token
circulation among inactive nodes. We propose the instruction-directed token MAC
(ID-MAC), a protocol that leverages the deterministic nature of quantum circuit
execution to predefine transmission schedules at compile time. By embedding
instruction-level information into the MAC layer, ID-MAC restricts token
circulation to active transmitters, thereby improving channel utilization and
reducing communication latency. Simulations show that ID-MAC reduces classical
communication time by up to 70% and total execution time by up to 30-70%, while
also extending effective system coherence. These results highlight ID-MAC as a
scalable and efficient MAC solution for future multi-chip quantum
architectures.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Werner QED offers a method to manipulate light-matter interactions in 2D photonic systems via engineered coupling directionality and patterned configurations, exhibiting four distinct dynamical behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion, originating from subradiant eigenmodes and tunable section transitions. The system is robust against nonguided losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating light-matter interactions in low-dimensional systems has broad applications in quantum information processing, nanophotonics, and subradiant transport control.

Method: The paper introduces a structured wQED framework where each emitter's coupling directionality can be individually tailored. They analyze different configurations to identify four distinct dynamical behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitation. Through spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, they attribute these dynamics to interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. They also perform variance analysis to study the influence of interatomic spacing and global chirality on excitation spreading, identifying tunable localization-delocalization transitions. Additionally, they consider nonguided losses to assess the system's robustness under realistic coupling efficiencies (>0.99).

Result: The findings demonstrate that engineered directionality patterns can be used to control excitation localization, coherence, and transport in wQED systems. This programmability paves the way for applications in subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.

Conclusion: This structured approach in wQED provides a practical method for manipulating excitation dynamics, enabling precise control over subradiant transport and chiral quantum effects. This has significant implications for advancing quantum information processing, nanophotonic devices, and the understanding of collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional systems.

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) has become a central platform for
studying collective light-matter interactions in low-dimensional photonic
environments. While conventional wQED systems rely on uniform chirality or
reciprocal emitter-waveguide coupling, we propose a structured wQED framework,
where the coupling directionality of each emitter can be engineered locally to
control excitation transport in an atom-nanophotonic interface. For different
combinations of patterned coupling directionalities of the emitters, we
identify four representative configurations that exhibit distinct dynamical
behaviors: centering, wave-like, leap-frog, and dispersion excitations.
Spectral analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian reveals that these
dynamics originate from interferences among subradiant eigenmodes. Variance
analysis further quantifies the spreading of excitation as functions of
interatomic spacing and global chirality, showing tunable
localization-delocalization transitions. Including nonguided losses, we find
that the transport characteristics remain robust for realistic coupling
efficiencies (beta >= 0.99). These results establish structured wQED as a
practical route to manipulate excitation localization, coherence, and transport
through programmable directionality patterns, paving the way for controllable
subradiant transport and chiral quantum information routing.

Abstract: Quantum simulation aims to recreate complex many-body phenomena in controlled

typically requiring ultra-pure vacuum or low temperatures. Here, we realize a
room-temperature quantum simulator using a thin ${}^{13}\text{C}$ nuclear spin
layer in diamond. Nearby nitrogen-vacancy centers enable polarization, readout,
and, combined with radio-frequency fields, coherent control of the nuclear
spins. We demonstrate strong, tunable interactions among the nuclear spins and
use the system to investigate discrete time-crystalline order. By combining
ease of use with operation at ambient temperatures, our work opens new
opportunities for investigating strongly correlated many-body effects.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用均值撞击时间（MHT）作为替代均方位移（MSD）来评估量子和经典随机游走的优势，发现量子 walk 在对称初始条件下与经典 walk 的 MHT 相同，但引入随机重置时量子 walk 可以获得更短的 MHT，且该优势随噪声增加而减弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子计算的快速发展，随机游走算法在量子计算中的应用变得重要。然而，传统用均方位移（MSD）来比较量子和经典随机游走的效率，可能无法全面反映两者的优缺点。为了更全面地评估量子和经典随机游走的性能，选择其他度量指标，如均值撞击时间（MHT），则是必要的。

Method: 论文通过数学分析，分别计算了对称初始条件下和引入随机重置时的量子和经典随机游走的均值撞击时间（MHT）。在对称初始条件下，两者 MHT 相同；在引入随机重置时，量子 walk 的 MHT 显著减小，而经典 walk 没有改善。

Result: 主要结果是，量子随机游走可以通过改变重置概率来优化搜索效率，即 MHT 的减少。此外，当噪声增加时，量子 walk 的优势逐渐被削弱，最终回归为经典行为。 

Conclusion: 该研究表明，选择不同的度量指标（如 MHT）可以更全面地比较量子和经典算法的性能。未来的研究可以进一步探讨其他度量指标在不同场景下的适用性，以更好地利用量子计算的优势。

Abstract: The mean squared displacement has been widely used as the primary metric for
comparing quantum and classical random walks, with quantum walks showing
quadratic scaling versus linear scaling for classical walks. However, this
comparison may not capture the full picture: while the mean squared
displacement is well-suited for Gaussian distributions, quantum walk
distributions exhibit distinctly non-Gaussian features. We propose that the
mean hitting time offers a complementary perspective with clear operational
meaning for search algorithms. Through analytical calculations, we show that
quantum and classical walks yield identical MHT for symmetric initial
conditions with two detectors, suggesting that the apparent quantum advantage
seen in MSD comparisons may be context-dependent. Interestingly, introducing
stochastic resetting reveals new dynamics. We demonstrate analytically that
quantum walks can achieve reduced MHT under stochastic reset through
quasi-momentum redistribution, while classical walks see no benefit. This
quantum advantage naturally degrades with noise, the quantum walk converges to
classical behavior. We suggest that MHT reduction under stochastic reset can
serve as an additional signature of quantum behavior, particularly useful for
characterizing quantum walk implementations on noisy quantum devices. Our
results indicate that different metrics can reveal different aspects of
quantum-classical comparisons in walk-based algorithms.

Abstract: The precise measurement of spatial attitude parameters is critical for
applications in inertial navigation, industrial monitoring, instrument
calibration, quantum metrology, etc. In this work, we theoretically investigate
and experimentally realize the simultaneous measurement of the yaw and pitch
angles using a Hermite-Gaussian-postselected double weak value system
integrated with two sets of high-order-mode balanced homodyne detections,
thereby achieving a complete characterization of the beam deflection. Signals
of the yaw and pitch angles that are involved in TEM$_{10}$ and TEM$_{01}$
modes output from two dark ports of the system can be measured independently.
As a result, the obtained minimum measurable yaw and pitch angles of beam
deflection are 83 prad and 89 prad, respectively. Meanwhile, the corresponding
displacements are 0.79 pm and 0.85 pm, respectively. This work expands the beam
deflection measurement to two dimensions, which provides a new insight for
future high-precision multi-parameter spatial precise detection.

Abstract: This paper investigates the construction of efficient quantum secret sharing
schemes for quantum access structures based on hypergraphs with three
hyperedges. We prove that hypercycles with three hyperedges are quantum access
structures if and only if they can be classified into 12 non-isomorphic types
under hypergraph isomorphism, and these hypercyclic quantum access structures
encompass all four hyperstars with three hyperedges.In prior work, efficient
and perfect quantum secret sharing schemes were constructed for hyperstar
access structures with three hyperedges using single photons in d -dimensional
quantum systems. These schemes correspond to classical perfect secret sharing
schemes with optimal information rates. However, for hypercyclic access
structures with three hyperedges, the method described above fails to yield
classical perfect secret sharing schemes with optimal information rates. In
this work, we explicitly construct classical perfect secret sharing schemes
with optimal information rates for these access structures by combining
Simmons' geometric method with Shamir's threshold scheme. Subsequently, we
employ single photons in d-dimensional quantum systems to build perfect QSS
schemes upon these classical constructions.We introduce the concept of
idealized information rate for minimal access structures in perfect QSS
schemes. By extending the notion of efficiency proposed by Cabello [Phys. Rev.
Lett., vol. 85, no. 26, p. 5635, 2000] for quantum key distribution protocols
to QSS, we define the efficiency of minimally authorized subsets. Furthermore,
we establish the relationship between the efficiency of minimally authorized
subsets and the idealized information rate of minimal access structures.
Finally, we rigorously prove that the QSS schemes constructed in this work
achieve the highest efficiency among existing solutions.

Abstract: Extending classical synchronization to the quantum domain is of great
interest both from the fundamental physics point of view and with a view toward
quantum technology applications. This work characterizes phase synchronization
of an effective spin-1 system, which is realized by coupling three quantum
states with infinite lifetime to auxiliary excited states that have a finite
lifetime. Integrating out the excited states, the effective spin-1 model
features coherent and incoherent effective couplings. Our key findings are: (i)
Phase synchronization can be controlled by adjusting the phases of the
couplings to the excited states. (ii) Unlike in the paradigmatic spin-1 system
studied in the literature, where the dissipative couplings describe decay into
the limit cycle state, the effective spin-1 model investigated in this work is
governed by a competition between dissipative decay into and out of the limit
cycle state, with the dissipative decay out of the limit cycle state playing a
critical role. (iii) We identify a parameter regime where phase synchronization
of the effective spin-1 system is -- in the absence of coherent effective
couplings -- governed entirely by the effective dissipators. The effective
spin-1 model is benchmarked through comparisons with master equation
calculations for the full Hilbert space. Physical insights are gained through
analytical perturbation theory calculations. Our findings, which are expected
to hold for a broad class of energy level and coupling schemes, are
demonstrated using hyperfine states of $^{87}$Rb.

Abstract: A promising platform for semi-device-independent quantum information is
prepare-and-measure experiments restricted only by a bound on the energy of the
communication. Here, we investigate the role of shared entanglement in such
scenarios. For classical communication, we derive a general correlation
criterion for nonlocal resources and use it to show that entanglement can fail
to be a resource in standard tasks. For quantum communication, we consider the
basic primitive for energy-constrained communication, namely the probabilistic
transmission of a bit, and show that the advantages of entanglement only can be
unlocked by non-unitary encoding schemes that purposefully decohere the
entangled state. We also find that these advantages can be increased by using
entanglement of higher dimension than qubit. We leverage these insights to
investigate the impact of entanglement for quantum random number generation,
which is a standard application of these systems but whose security so far only
has been established against classical side information. In the low-energy
regime, our attacks on the protocol indicate that the security remains largely
intact, thereby paving the way for strengthened security without more complex
setups and with negligible performance reductions.

Abstract: Entanglement entropy is a fundamental diagnostic for quantum chaos, typically
exhibiting volume-law scaling in highly excited eigenstates of chaotic
many-body systems. In this work, we present a striking counterexample: a
Floquet-driven quantum many-body system with Rydberg-like blockade that,
despite being fully chaotic as indicated by its Wigner-Dyson level statistics
and local thermalization, exhibits a strict area-law entanglement entropy.
Specifically, the entanglement entropy of every Floquet eigenstate is bounded
by $\ln2$, independent of system size. We trace this anomaly to the specific
Hilbert space structure imposed by the blockades, which restricts the Schmidt
rank across a bipartition. Furthermore, we generalize this discovery by
establishing a duality between constrained many-body Hamiltonians and
single-particle quantum walks on median graphs, and we outline a general
procedure for constructing systems with an entanglement entropy bounded by a
predetermined constant. Our results demonstrate that entanglement entropy alone
is an insufficient diagnostic of many-body quantum chaos and highlight the
profound impact of Hilbert space geometry on quantum dynamics and
thermalization.

Abstract: Quantum networks, which integrate multiple quantum computers and the channels
connecting them, are crucial for distributed quantum information processing but
remain inherently susceptible to channel noise. Channel purification emerges as
a promising technique for suppressing noise in quantum channels without complex
encoding and decoding operations, making it particularly suitable for remote
quantum information transmission in optical systems. In this work, we introduce
an experimental setup for efficient channel purification, harnessing the
spatial and polarization properties of photons. Our design employs two Fredkin
gates to enable coherent interference between independent noise channels,
achieving effective noise suppression across a wide range of noise levels and
types. Through application to entanglement distribution, our protocol
demonstrates a superior capability to preserve entanglement against channel
noise compared to conventional entanglement purification methods.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了在能量有限资源的情况下，纠缠策略可以显著提高相关性，并且对一些量子任务的实现具有重要的指导意义。

Abstract: Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions
about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers
a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this
work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption
in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared
quantum states. In contrast to previous studies that restricted the preparation
and measurement devices to be classically correlated, we show that allowing
entanglement strictly enlarges the set of achievable correlations. We identify
two operational consequences of this result. The first concerns randomness
certification, where we show that allowing the adversary to employ entangled
strategies may significantly reduce the amount of certifiable randomness. This
includes situations where the amount of randomness drops to zero in the
presence of entanglement, while it remains positive when entanglement is
excluded. Second, for the task of distinguishing an arbitrary quantum channel
from the identity, we show that the known dimension-independent bound on the
advantage conferred by entanglement is violated under an energy constraint.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a
macroscopic lossy sphere by means of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in the
form of modified Langevin noise formalism. The two ingoing photons with
arbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two
different directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering
involves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing
photons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of
two different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing
interference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is
governed by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational
invariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such
that the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect
constructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric
and antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses
on quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the
scattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy
spheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like
traits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects,
occurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency
and side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall
scattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the
Mie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are
extremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus
suggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to
identify entanglement.

Abstract: The one-way quantum computation utilizing bosonic modes of light offers
unmatched scalability of light modes, and it has seen rapid experimental
development recently. Scalability requires robust and low-error gates and
measurements. Squeezing gate is one of the necessary Gaussian operations. We
find the optimal squeezing gate in cluster state architecture. Our approach
newly uses amplitude transmission coefficients of unbalanced beam splitters and
homodyne detection with subsequent unity-gain feed-forward to squeeze the input
state. The approach outperforms the current method based on optimally rotated
homodyne detection, but with fixed balanced beam splitters. The performance of
both cluster state squeezers is evaluated for Gaussian and non-Gaussian input
states. We use different metrics to benchmark the quality of squeezed output
states. The result opens a road to low-noise squeezing gates in experimentally
achievable cluster states.

*Karol Horodecki,Chirag Srivastava,Leonard Sikorski,Siddhartha Das*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for quantum resource management that repurposes discarded quantum states as inputs for subsequent tasks, enhancing their utility. The authors demonstrate this by extracting private randomness from residual states after quantum key distribution protocols, providing specific rates for the Devetak-Winter and Gottesman-Lo protocols. They also outline a general principle for improving quantum resource utilization in sequential tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum resource management is crucial for optimizing quantum information processing tasks. The conventional approach focuses solely on resource distillation, neglecting the potential value of residual states. This paper seeks to address this gap by introducing a framework that leverages these residual states.

Method: The authors employ quantum resource theories to analyze the utility of discarded states. They use mathematical tools such as entropy measures and optimization techniques to determine the rates at which private randomness can be extracted. The Devetak-Winter and Gottesman-Lo protocols are used as case studies to validate their framework.

Result: Discarded states after quantum key distribution protocols such as Devetak-Winter and Gottesman-Lo can yield private randomness. Specific achievable rates for private randomness from residual states are calculated for both protocols. A general principle for enhancing quantum resource utilization across sequential tasks is established.

Conclusion: By repurposing discarded quantum states, the proposed framework significantly improves the utility of quantum resources. This approach not only enhances resource efficiency but also opens new avenues for quantum information processing tasks.

Abstract: We propose a framework for quantum residual management, in which states
discarded after a resource distillation process are repurposed as inputs for
subsequent quantum information tasks. This approach extends conventional
quantum resource theories by incorporating secondary resource extraction from
residual states, thereby enhancing overall resource utility. As a concrete
example, we investigate the distillation of private randomness from the
residual states remaining after quantum key distribution (QKD). More
specifically, we quantitatively show that after performing a well-known
coherent Devetak-Winter protocol one can locally extract private randomness
from its residual. We further consider the Gottesman-Lo QKD protocol, and
provide the achievable rate of private randomness from the discarded states
that are left after its performance. We also provide a formal framework that
highlights a general principle for improving quantum resource utilization
across sequential information processing tasks.
