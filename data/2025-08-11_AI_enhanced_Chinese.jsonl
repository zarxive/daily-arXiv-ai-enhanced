Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems\nwhose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very\npromising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this\nwork, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant\nformalism to describe clocks in first quantization.

In an\nanalogous scenario, a classical particle inside a closed regular region in the\nphase space is dynamically bound from escaping to other regions of the phase\nspace. Here, the physical potential barrier is replaced by dynamical barriers\nwhich separate different regions of the phase space. However, in the quantum\nregime, the system can overcome such dynamical barriers and escape through\nthem, giving rise to dynamical tunneling. In chaotic Hamiltonian systems,\ndynamical tunneling refers to quantum tunneling between states whose classical\nlimit correspond to symmetry-related regular regions separated by a chaotic\nzone between which any classical transport is prohibited. Here, an experimental\nrealization of dynamical tunneling in spin systems is reported using nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) architecture. In particular, dynamical tunneling in\nquantum kicked tops of spin-1 and spin-3/2 systems using two- and three-qubit\nNMR registers is investigated. By extracting time-dependent expectation values\nof the angular momentum operator components, size-dependent tunneling behaviour\nfor various initial states is systematically investigated.

Our results, obtained using unbiased methods for an interacting\nsystem on a ladder geometry, demonstrate how one can engineer time-dependent\nperturbations to release suppressed orders, potentially providing insight into\nthe underlying mechanism in related experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u6838\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u5728\u5149\u8f90\u7167\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53cd Grammar error density\u6ce2\u76f8\u53d8\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u653e\u5927\u96f6\u52a8\u91cf\u5360\u636e\u548c\u7535\u8377\u521a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u5bc6\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5747\u8861\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u975e\u5747\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u914d\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8f90\u7167\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u786c\u6838\u73bb\u8272\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6ce2\u76f8\u53d8\u5bfc\u81f4\u96f6\u52a8\u91cf\u5360\u636e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u653e\u5927\u548c\u7535\u8377\u521a\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5149\u8f90\u7167\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u8c03\u63a7\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u6709\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Our approach spectrally splits a high-power laser pulse, imprints\ndistinct helical phases on each component, and coherently recombines them.\nHyperspectral imaging, off-axis holography, and spectral phase reconstruction\nconfirm excellent agreement with theory and reveal the potential to drive\nsuperluminal rotational velocities. Introducing spectral chirp demonstrates\nfurther control of the temporal evolution of the transverse mode structure.\nThis platform opens new regimes of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction where\nlaser OAM can directly couple to plasma OAM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5f39\u7c27\u5728\u9ad8\u5f3a\u6fc0\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u8fdc\u8d85\u8fc710^18 W/cm\u00b2\u7684\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u9694\u3001 imprint \u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u91cd\u7ec4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u5f39\u7c27\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6fc0\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u6750\u6599\u5728\u6b64\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a8\u52a8\u6fc0\u5149\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u9694\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6fc0\u5149\u8109\u51b2\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u87ba\u65cb\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u76f8\u5e72\u91cd\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff081.4e18 W/cm\u00b2\uff09\u5149\u5f39\u7c27\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u65cb\u8f6c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u8fdb\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6fc0\u5149\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u5f39\u7c27\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6750\u6599\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a ultra-high-intensity \u6fc0\u5149-\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN)\nmicro-ring resonators with periodically poled quasi-phase matching have shown\nhigh-quality photon pair generation. However, periodic poling technology\nremains expensive and requires complex fabrication hindering its scalability\nand capability for practical application in nonlinear photonic devices. To\naddress this, we propose a scalable approach using TFLN micro-ring resonators\nbased on modal phase matching to achieve cost-effective, efficient high-quality\nphoton-pair generation, significantly simplifying fabrication. We achieved pair\ngeneration rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW through spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion, with coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 1200.

We introduce a light-activated\nsystem that combines plasmonic gold nanorods with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)\nmonolayer to gate surface reactivity based on each rod's geometry under optical\nillumination. Laser excitation tuned to a rod's plasmon resonance and\npolarization collapses the polymer into a compact shell on that rod, blocking\nreactive head groups and creating a long-lived, kinetically trapped inert state\nstable for days. During this interval, orthogonal chemical transformations can\nbe performed on adjacent, unilluminated rods without interference.

The consequence of our result is twofold: (a) it allows us to\nidentify complexity-theoretic conditions under which QWOA must be\noverparameterized to obtain optimal or approximate solutions, and (b) it\nimplies the absence of barren plateaus in the loss landscape of QWOA for\n$\\mathsf{NP}$ optimization problems with polynomially bounded cost functions\n($\\mathsf{NPO}\\text{-}\\mathsf{PB}$).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af\u6700\u9069\u5316\u30a2\u30eb\u30b4\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\uff08QWOA\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u306e\u6b21\u5143\u3092endas upper bounds\u3067\u898b\u7a4d\u3082\u308a\uff0c\u3053\u308c\u306b\u3088\u308aQWOA\u304c_redispatch complexity-theoretic\u6761\u4ef6\u304c molto necessario\u3067\u5fc5\u987boverparameterized\u304c\u5fc5\u8981 essere and barren plateaus\u306e absence\u304c prueba.", "motivation": "Quantum computing\u662f\u975e\u5e38 hot Topic &amp;andalgorithm_flash_\u91cf\u5b50\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af\u306f Optimization problem\u3092\u89e3\u6c7a\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e strong candidate., \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u306f QWOA\u306e expressivity\u3068trainability\u3092\u7814\u7a76\u3059\u308b ABOVE.\u201d \uff0c ", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u306f quantum\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af\u306eOptimization algorithm\u306e Quantum Walk Optimization Algorithm (QWOA)\u3067\u306eansatz\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3092 analysis did deep mathematical analysis of\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u306e\u6b21\u5143\uc5d0\u7eff\u8272\u53d1\u5c55 bounds\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86 .", "result": "\u7814\u7a76 result\u306f QWOA\u306e\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u306e\u6b21\u5143 upper bounds\u3092 \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 \u305d\u3057\u3066\u3053\u308c\u3089\u306e consequences: (1) QWOA\u304cmust overparameterized need to reach optimal solutions(training) &.similar_condition \uff0c (2) quantum algorithms\u5bf9\u4e8eNPOptimization \u95ee\u9898\u65e0 barren landscape .", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790QWOA\u7684\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5173\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eNP\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0cQWOA\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570 Landscape\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709 barren plateaus\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8868\u660eQWOA\u9700\u8981\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime\ncurvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with\nthe coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its\nderivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time\nintegrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important\npart of the calculational scheme.

This presents a significant challenge\nfor near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. To address this,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Windowed Quantum Amplitude Estimation (AWQAE)\nframework, a modular, scalable and adaptive approach that decouples estimation\nprecision from the number of physical qubits required in a single circuit.\nAWQAE operates by iteratively estimating the phase bits in small, fixed-size\nchunks, using a number of smaller, independent quantum circuits, which are\namenable to parallel processing. A key technical contribution of this work is\nintroduction of a phase resolution circuit and an ancilla-guided mechanism that\nenables accurate chunk assignment and eigenphase reconstruction in the presence\nof multiple eigenstates. This design is inherently NISQ-friendly, by lowering\ncircuit depth and qubit count per block to reduce decoherence and noise\neffects. A key component of our approach is a robust classical post-processing\nalgorithm that resolves measurement ambiguities that arise during the iterative\nprocess.

Among the\navailable implementations, the superconducting technology is the current focus\nof scientific research and industrial applications, excelling in performance\nand scalability. Despite this, superconducting quantum systems are extremely\nprone to decoherence, and in particular, they are highly sensitive to radiation\nevents. In this paper, we analyze the response of a superconducting device\n(SQUID) to radiation.

On\nthe other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives\nin energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that\nnonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a\ndamped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to\nnonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness\nagainst disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for\nsteady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a\nfine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium\ncase. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition\ndriven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a\ntime-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by\nthe geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete\nsymmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple\nharmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down.\nOur predictions have important physical implications for a three-component\nspinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the\nstructural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated\nself-organized BECs.
