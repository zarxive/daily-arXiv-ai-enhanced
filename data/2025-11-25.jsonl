While up-conversion and optical Kerr gating (OKG) offer femtosecond resolution, they are generally limited to ensemble measurements, making ultrafast detection in nano-optics challenging. OKG, with its broadband response and high throughput without phase-matching, is especially promising when used at high repetition rates under focused illumination.\n  Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast detection scheme using the third-order nonlinearity of graphene and thin graphite films, operating at 1 GHz with sub-nanojoule pulses and achieving 141 fs temporal resolution. Their exceptionally large nonlinear refractive index, orders of magnitude higher than conventional Kerr media, enhances detection efficiency at smaller thicknesses, enables sub-picosecond response, and supports broadband operation. Their atomic-scale thickness minimizes dispersion and simplifies integration with microscopy platforms, optical fibers, and nanophotonic circuits, making them a compact, practical material platform for nano-optical and on-chip ultrafast Kerr gating."}

Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials."}

This yields a clear physical interpretation in terms of zero-point and thermal contributions to the Helmholtz free energy. The formalism is then applied to the GP action producing the 1PI effective potential at zero and finite temperature including beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang and thermal corrections. We discuss the gapless and gapped Bogoliubov spectra, their relevance to equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes, and the role of regularization. Applications include the inclusion of an external potential within the local density approximation, the derivation of finite-temperature Josephson equations, and the extension to D dimensional systems. This unified approach provides a transparent connection between microscopic quantum fluctuations and effective macroscopic equations of motion for Bose-Einstein condensates."}

These transitions are too weak to be detected with dispersive methods and too overlapping to be resolved by solid-state detectors. Here, we propose the use of cryogenic microcalorimeters, which possess high efficiency and excellent energy resolution in the relevant energy regime, coupled with state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by performing extensive calculations and realistic simulations. In this way, we establish that the uncertainty in the absolute moment, which is transferred to the quadrupole moments of all isotopes in the chain, could be reduced by up to an order of magnitude within a day of measurement. These precise reference quadrupole moments serve as valuable inputs for nuclear structure studies and for benchmarking state-of-the-art quantum chemistry calculations in open-shell elements."}

This work focuses specifically on this low-energy regime, where sparse hit patterns limit the performance of topology-based reconstruction and classification methods. We introduce Waveform-based Particle Identification (WavePID), a statistically rigorous and interpretable likelihood-ratio discriminator for track-cascade separation, built from Monte Carlo templates in timing-aware, physics-motivated observables and validated through dedicated simulations. Applied to both Monte Carlo and 11.1 years of IceCube data, WavePID suggests improved cascade purity by about 5 percentage points at a fixed 20% down-selection rate relative to the current leading cascade selection, while maintaining Data-MC agreement within detector systematics. The approach is compact and robust to sparse observations, demonstrating the value of waveform-level timing for low-energy reconstruction."}

Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $Δ$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $Δ$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $Δ$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory."}

On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model. Finally, we devise a new temperature-flow scheme that implements a cutoff in both the propagator and the bare interaction, and demonstrate its validity on a model of an Anderson impurity coupled to a phonon."}

Optical velocimetry and multi-channel pyrometry were used to obtain Hugoniot data, isentropic release paths, and interface temperature histories. The results validate a modified two-phase equation of state (EOS) for copper based on the framework of Greeff et al. The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states. Theoretical analysis of temperature release profiles suggests that the thermal conductivity of shocked copper powders may be considerably higher than first-principles predictions. Crucially, despite heterogeneity in shock heating, the macroscopic dynamic response of copper powders with a porosity of ~1.7 is well captured by an average-density EOS model, supporting the use of porous material experiments for EOS validation under extreme conditions."}

Typical approaches to deriving optimal, error-minimizing, non-equilibrium driving protocols for estimating these landscapes require a priori knowledge of the landscape. Here, we present an alternative: an iterative algorithm for optimizing full free energy landscape reconstructions which can be used alongside experiments on unknown landscapes. Our approach (i) takes experimental or simulated trajectory data; (ii) reconstructs an `approximate' energy landscape; (iii) derives optimal control protocols from low-dimensional differentiable Brownian dynamics simulations on the candidate landscape using automatic differentiation; (iv) re-runs the experiment or simulation using the updated protocol; and (v) iterates until convergence. Using this approach, we recover known benchmarks from the literature and probe far-from-equilibrium regimes for symmetric, asymmetric, and triple-well energy landscapes under both 1- and 2-dimensional control. Our control protocols -- derived with no a priori knowledge of the energy landscape -- yield substantially reduced variance and bias in free energy landscape reconstructions compared to naive linear protocols."}

Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice.

Using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we compute total excitation cross sections for circular Rydberg states of hydrogen, rubidium, and cesium targets using Bessel electron beams. Our models account for the full Bessel-beam structure of the incident electron and incorporate macroscopic target effects to model experimentally-relevant conditions. Our results show that twisted electrons with large opening angles produce significant enhancements in the excitation probability relative to plane-wave electrons, particularly for large opening angles and low energies. We trace this enhancement to contributions from projectiles with large values of orbital angular momentum.

In this work, we performed scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on the pyrochlore superconductor CsBi2 and spin liquid Pr2Ir2O7 at 0.3 K. For the first time, we obtained atomically resolved images of their (111) surfaces, revealing a hexagonal lattice or a kagome lattice. Tunneling spectroscopy in CsBi2 reveals a nearly fully opened superconductivity gap. The ratio of 2Δ/kBTC = 4.7 suggests relatively strong coupling superconductivity, as compared with that in kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs). In contrast to the previous study categorizing CsBi2 as a type-I superconductor, the applied magnetic field induces a hexagonal vortex lattice in which each vortex core exhibits an intriguing three-fold symmetry state. In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids."}

When incident loads take the form of acoustic or vibrational waves, the ability to mechanically process information eliminates the need for transduction, paving the way for passive computing. Recent studies have proposed systems that learn and execute mechanical logic through buckling, bistability, and origami-inspired lattices. However, owing to the large timescales of shape morphing, such concepts suffer from slow operation or require active stimulation of adaptive materials. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach to mechanical logic, leveraging the rich dynamics of wave propagation in elastic structures. In lieu of traditional forward-design tools, such as band diagrams and transmission spectra, we employ a multi-faceted topology optimization approach, enabling us to identify candidate waveguide configurations within an extremely large design space. By incorporating voids within an otherwise uniform substrate, the optimized waveguides are able to precisely manipulate wave propagation paths, triggering desirable interferences of the scattered wavefield that culminate in energy localization at readouts corresponding to a given logic function. An experimental setup is used to demonstrate the efficacy of such logic gates and their resilience to non-uniform loading. By implementing these building blocks into a mechanical adder, we demonstrate the scalable deployment of more sophisticated mechanical computing circuits, opening up new avenues in mechanical signal processing and physical computing."}

Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations, where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications."}

Further, the larger number of internal parameters allows for the exploration of different forms of heterogeneity among the individual oscillators. When rotational symmetry is preserved there can be various forms of synchronization as well as multistability and $partial$ amplitude death, namely, the quenching of oscillations within a subset of variables that asymptote to the same constant value. The oscillatory dynamics in these cases are characterized by phase-locking and phase-drift. When the coupling breaks rotational symmetry we observe $partial$ synchronization (when a subset of the variables coincide and oscillate) and $partial$ oscillation death (when a subset of variables asymptote to different stationary values), as well as the coexistence of these different partial quenching phenomena."}

A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \\textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\\times$2 up to 5$\\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns.

The extended wavefunction of the Rydberg electron induces a finite-range potential that can bind atoms from the BCS medium, forming molecular states. As a consequence, the optical absorption spectrum of the impurity encodes key many-body properties. Using the functional determinant approach, we provide a direct measure of the superfluid gap through frequency shifts of dimer and trimer peaks. The spectra also reveal whether the Cooper pairs are broken or trapped intact. For static Rydberg atoms, we relate this signature of pairing to the suppression of the orthogonality catastrophe due to the superconducting gap resulting in the formation of well-defined polaron quasiparticles.

The magneto-optical resonances are observed as a change in the ellipticity parameter of the light wave polarization when scanning the transverse magnetic field near zero. We use a miniature ($\\approx\\,$$0.125$ cm$^3$) glass cesium vapor cell heated to a relatively low temperature of $\\approx\\,$$85^\\circ$C. Under the current experimental conditions, the sensitivity of magnetic field measurements is limited by a technical noise, reaching $180$ fT/$\\surd$Hz in a $200$ Hz bandwidth. The ultimate photon-shot-noise-limited sensitivity of the method is estimated to be $\\approx\\,$$5$ fT/$\\surd$Hz. The proposed scheme is promising for the development of a zero-field atomic magnetometer with reduced heat dissipation of the sensor head and relaxed requirements for magnetic shielding compared to counterparts operating in the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime. These features are of particular value for biomedical applications."}

Existing {\\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments."}

The silicon platform offers several advantages, including significantly lower cost, CMOS compatibility, and mature fabrication processes. However, a silicon-based design for modulating thermal emission remains absent. Here, we present an all-silicon device utilising electrical control over carrier dynamics to modulate a narrowband thermal emission in the mid-infrared region. We design a silicon device exhibiting voltage-controlled narrowband thermal emission at 10 μm and confirm its performance using electromagnetic calculations. This work paves the way for scalable, low-cost, and integrated thermal emission devices made possible by the silicon platform."}

The significance of this search lies in its fast and unmodeled approach, leveraging a cross-correlation technique to identify common signals across the detector network. As a result, this method serves as an excellent alternative to search for unknown or poorly modeled continuous wave sources and narrowband components of the gravitational wave (GW) background. For continuous wave sources whose waveform can be modeled, this method can serve as the first stage of a hierarchical scheme by identifying sub-threshold candidates to be followed up with more optimal but computationally expensive searches. The ASAF search, however, presently suffers from beam smearing, where multiple candidates may arise due to the same noise fluctuations, detector artifact, or a GW source. This can reduce the detection probability in follow-up analyzes, especially with limited computing resources. To mitigate this issue and reduce the number of correlated and unnecessary candidates, we introduce a novel Peak Finder algorithm. This algorithm helps identifying the most representative candidates while preserving detection sensitivity, thereby allowing follow up of a much larger number of independent candidates. The reduction in correlated samples leads to a significant reduction in False Dismissal Rate (FDR) using the Peak Finder method compared to the Full-sky method. For instance, following up 2 Peak Finder candidates at 30 Hz reduces FDR by a factor of 3."}

Our framework generalizes both the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt and Gisin's elegant inequalities, yielding Bell expressions maximally violated by any number of pairwise anticommuting Clifford observables together with the corresponding maximally entangled state. Under suitable assumptions, our inequalities also enable the device-independent certification of Majorana fermions, understood as multiqubit realizations of Clifford algebra generators. Importantly, we identify an additional equivalence that must be incorporated into the definition of self-testing beyond invariance under local isometries and transposition. This equivalence arises from partial transposition applied to the shared state and to the measurements, which in specific cases leaves all observed correlations unchanged."}

By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses.

The dipole moments (DMs) of the 21 electronic states of ICl+ are systematically studied, and the variations of DMs of the identical symmetry state in the avoided crossing regions are elucidated by analyzing the dominant electronic configuration. With the help of the calculated SOC matrix element, the interaction between crossing states can be elucidated. Spin-orbit coupling matrix elements involving the several states are calculated. By analyzing potential energy curves of these states and the nearby electronic states, the possible predissociation channels are provided.

The comparison of the spectroscopic constants including and excluding SOC effect indicates that the SOC effect has an obvious correction to the spectroscopic properties of low-lying states.

In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder.

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation."}

For $t'\\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit.

Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour.

Conventional Wave Front Sensing technique (WFS), which relies on the beat between the carrier and phase-modulated (PM) sidebands, is dominated by arm-axis signals when the carrier resonates in the full interferometer. This dominance limits the detection of other optical axes, such as the Power Recycling Cavity (PRC) and incident beam axes. To address this problem, we propose a novel sensing technique, \"Phase-Modulated-sideband $\\times$ Phase-Modulated-sideband Wave Front Sensing\" (PMPMWFS), which demodulates the beat signal at the difference frequency between two anti-resonant PM sidebands. We derived the theoretical response of PMPMWFS and experimentally demonstrated it using the Power-Recycled X-arm (PRXARM) configuration of KAGRA. The results show that PMPMWFS effectively decouples angular fluctuation signals of the PRC and incident beam from those of the arm cavity and provides orthogonal signal components for the end mirror of the arm cavity. Furthermore, feedback control using PMPMWFS achieved stable interferometer locking for over one hour. These results demonstrate that PMPMWFS offers an effective sensing method for decoupling multiple alignment degrees of freedom in future gravitational-wave detectors."}

Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts. We experimentally explore the topological phase in an acoustic quasicrystal. Surprisingly, we also discover symmetry-protected zero-energy modes near the center of the quasicrystal in a topologically trivial phase, a phenomenon not seen in crystals. We further experimentally observe these modes in a topologically trivial acoustic quasicrystal. Our work represents the first experimental observation of topological phases in quasicrystals without crystalline counterparts, paving the way for the study of exotic topological physics in quasicrystals."}

Isotonic (constant neutron number) systematics in the deformed rare-earth region have long suggested that odd-$Z$ nuclei are more compact than their even-$Z$ neighbors - except for Lu, whose recommended radius appeared anomalously large relative to Yb and Hf. We report a high-precision determination of the natural-abundance-averaged Lu-Yb charge-radius difference using extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy of highly charged Na-like and Mg-like ions, supported by high-accuracy relativistic atomic-structure calculations - a recently introduced method with the unique ability to measure inter-element charge radius differences. Combined with muonic-atom and optical isotope-shift data, our result resolves the longstanding Lu inversion anomaly and reestablishes a pronounced odd-even staggering along the $N=94$ isotonic chain. The magnitude of this staggering is unexpectedly large, far exceeding that observed in semi-magic nuclei and in deformed isotopic sequences. State-of-the-art nuclear density functional theory calculations, including quantified uncertainties, fail to reproduce this enhancement, possibly indicating missing structural effects in current models. Our work demonstrates the power of highly charged ions for precise, element-crossing charge-radius measurements and provides stringent new constraints for future theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear-size systematics."}

The modern numerical derivation of the 27 $B_k^q$ Stevens crystal field parameters (CFPs), which describe the splitting of the energy levels of a central ion, is traditionally achieved through the effective Hamiltonian theory and multiconfiguration wavefunction theory calculations, insofar as the lowest $J$ level fully captures the targeted low-energy physics.

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}

At the gap, the instrumental resolution skews the signal, producing a high-energy tail that complicates fitting. Our function assumes an instrumental $Q$-resolution with two equal wide and one narrow direction (typical of focused TAS instruments), and a parabolic dispersion at the gap, which is exact for quadratic and accurate for linear dispersions if the resolution is moderate. We demonstrate, that our function outperforms previous methods of fitting a gap, by giving a better fit and more accurate gap determination, seen in figure 4. Here, the anti-ferromagnetically gapped material; MnF$_2$ is simulated in a double-focusing TAS instrument. We also tested our function on experimental data on MnF$_2$ from a TAS-like instrument, where we reproduce the gap size from previous accurate experimentally determined measurements. The function is simple to implement, converges reliably, and we recommend its use for future gap fitting on TAS data."}

This method enables both directional monitoring and quantitative assessment of charge transfer among donor (D), bridge (B), and acceptor (A) moieties. We applied this approach to a series of newly designed carbazole-based prototypical organic dyes, doping the bridge at positions 1, 2, and 3 with nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms to generate mono-, di-, and tri-doped variants. Our results demonstrate a clear and progressive enhancement in charge transfer as the degree of nitrogen or oxygen doping increases from mono- to di- to tri-doped systems. For mono-doped dyes, the highest forward charge transfer from donor to bridge to acceptor (D$\\xrightarrow{}$B$\\xrightarrow{}$A) occurs when a heteroatom (N or O) is placed in the terminal ring of the bridge, closer to the acceptor. In di-doped dyes, the largest forward charge transfer is observed when heteroatoms occupy both terminal positions, with one atom (N or S) adjacent to the donor and the other (N) near the acceptor. Nitrogen-doped systems consistently outperform their oxygen and sulfur counterparts. Among all variants, the organic dye doped with three nitrogen atoms at the bridge exhibits the most efficient and highest directional donor-to-acceptor charge transfer (42.6\\%), making it the most promising candidate for potential applications in dye-sensitized solar cells. Finally, our calculations predict weak charge separation in all systems, indicating that charge transfer predominantly occurs from the bridge to the acceptor."}

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."}

Under the irradiation of righthanded circularly polarized light, we predict a three-stage topological phase transition in plumbene, whether it is in a free-standing form or grown on h-BN. Initially, a metallic state evolves into a K(K')-valley-based QAH state with a Chern number of -8, which then decreases to -6 after the valley gap closes. Finally, a band inversion occurs at the $Γ$ point, resulting in a multichannel QAH state with C = -3. The trigonal warping model accounts for both K(K')-valley-based and $Γ$-pointbased QAH states. Additionally, growing plumbene on a non-van-der-Waals substrate eliminates the K(K')-valley-based topology, leaving only the $Γ$-point-based QAH state with C = +3.

Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware.

The RMB is part of the new generation of multipurpose reactors, and studying neutron transport is essential for the project to meet its objectives of producing radioisotopes, irradiating materials, and generating neutron beams for scientific investigations. The neutron moderation process in the reflector tank is very well described by Maxwellian distributions, which provide temperatures ranging from T = 331.5 K in the core to T = 266.8 K in the peripheral regions. The relative proportions reveal the predominance (52%) of epithermal neutrons in the reactor core, followed by thermal (29%) and fast (19%) neutrons. The moderation process proves to be effective, considering that 100% of the neutrons fall within the thermal spectrum near the reflector tank wall. The fits using Maxwellian distributions reveal another effect of neutron moderation, a shift in the peak wavelength from 1.07 Å to 1.19 Å. The same effect is observed along the tube that supplies a neutron beam to the RMB imaging instrument, with $λ_{peak}$ = 1.18 Å increasing to $λ_{peak}$ = 1.21 Å."}

The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters.

While the non-Bloch polarization $P_β$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_β$ and the entanglement polarization $χ$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_β \\equiv χ(\\tilde{H})\\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $χ(\\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics."}

It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems.

This protocol is efficient for Clifford+T circuits with logarithmically many T-gates, where the limiting factor in the efficiency of the protocol is the difficulty, on input a quantum circuit $C$, of the classical task of producing a description of the unitary obtained by conjugating a Pauli $P$ (corresponding to a Bell-measurement outcome) by $C$, where this description only depends on the input-output functionality of $CPC^{\\dagger}$. The task above, in turn, is at least as hard as the problem of determining whether two $n$-qubit quantum circuits are perfectly equivalent up to global phase. In 2009, Tanaka defined the corresponding decision problem Exact Non-Identity Check (ENIC) and showed that ENIC is NQP-complete in general. Motivated by this, we consider in this work what happens when we pass from low T-count to low T-depth.

Nevertheless, it relies on large, diverse real-world medical data, whose availability is limited by privacy concerns and practical challenges. Although data augmentation has been extensively studied in various other deep learning tasks, it has not been systematically explored for MMF imaging. This work provides the first in-depth experimental and computational study on the efficacy and limitations of augmentation techniques in this field. We demonstrate that standard image transformations and conditional generative adversarial-based synthetic speckle generation fail to improve, or even deteriorate, reconstruction quality, as they neglect the complex modal interference and dispersion that results in speckle formation. To address this, we introduce a physical data augmentation method in which only organ images are digitally transformed, while their corresponding speckles are experimentally acquired via fiber. This approach preserves the physics of light-fiber interaction and enhances the reconstruction structural similarity index measure~(SSIM) by up to 17\\%, forming a viable system for reliable MMF imaging under limited data conditions."}

Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures. This work provides a powerful and accessible tool for the numerical exploration of topological phenomena in interacting mixed states, opening a pathway to study systems previously inaccessible due to computational obstacles."}

Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style.

This distinction originates from the path traced by its rotation matrices within the doubly connected SO(3) group manifold, leading to a nontrivial spinor phase of $e^{iπ}$ upon encircling the texture. Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $σ_z$ component with weak dipolar $σ_x, σ_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $σ_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone.

We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians.

In this study, we show that in the deep inverted Marcus regime, the augmented-FSSH (AFSSH, one version that includes decoherence) yields reasonably accurate rate constants but incorrect thermal populations over a broad range of parameters. We present an analytical derivation to understand the AFSSH behavior, and therefore, show that AFSSH obtains correct rate constants owing to the resonance of the time derivative coupling with the exothermicity, but obtains an incorrect thermal population owing to the self-consistency issue. The presented derivation provides an analytical expression for the quantum correction factor for AFSSH simulations in the Marcus inverted regime."}

The measured Hugoniot shows good agreement with the present model but exhibits significant softening above ~156 GPa relative to the original Greeff EOS, indicating that reduction in lattice specific heat becomes essential when shock temperatures exceed three times the melting point (T > 3Tm). Unloading behavior matches hydrodynamic simulations incorporating the recalibrated EOS, confirming its accuracy for off-Hugoniot states.

A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \\textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\\times$2 up to 5$\\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths. Our work establishes a pathway towards the development of large scale PCM-based reconfigurable multi-port devices which will allow implementing matrix operations on three orders of magnitude smaller areas than interferometer meshes."}

One of the key distinctions between a ciphertext embedding a covert message and an original ciphertext, compared to an anamorphic ciphertext, lies in the indistinguishability between the original ciphertext and the anamorphic ciphertext. This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption. Additionally, we introduce a definition of quantum anamorphic encryption that relies on symmetric key encryption. Furthermore, we provide a detailed generalized construction of quantum anamorphic symmetric key encryption within a general framework, which involves taking any two quantum density matrices of any different dimensions and constructing a single quantum density matrix, which is the quantum anamorphic ciphertext containing ciphertexts of both of them. Subsequently, we introduce a definition of computational anamorphic secret-sharing and extend the work of Çakan et al. on computational quantum secret-sharing to computational quantum anamorphic secret-sharing, specifically addressing scenarios with multiple messages, multiple keys, and a single share function. This proposed secret-sharing scheme demonstrates impeccable security measures against quantum adversaries."}

Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency."}

These spacetimes violated the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). Lentz proposed a new type of warp drive in 2020. It was claimed that this warp spacetime has non-negative energy density and can therefore be sourced by a classical plasma. We demonstrate that Lentz's claim is incorrect. We begin with a direct calculation of the energy-momentum tensor of Lentz's warp drive in a Eulerian reference frame, and show that there are spacetime regions where the energy density is negative. We then examine the theoretical basis of Lentz's investigation and identify several derivation errors. The derivation errors can be somewhat ameliorated with a modified version of Lentz's geometry, which more closely respects the equalities and inequalities discussed by Lentz. Even so, we show that the modified geometry still violates the WEC even in the Eulerian reference frame. We conclude with a brief discussion of no-go theorems and their relationship to geometries of the kind proposed by Lentz."}

Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts.

These modifications induce a secular drift in the orbital evolution of circular geodesic orbits, leading to measurable dephasing in the resulting EMRIs waveforms.

We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume.

Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $β$-smooth and $γ$-strongly convex / concave, where $β$ and $γ$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $ρ$ and $σ$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision.

The recently developed time-dependent double coupled-cluster (TD-dCC) ansatz achieves this by combining correlation effects from the N- and (N-1)-electron sectors, but its exact formulation remains computationally demanding. Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes.

Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights. In parallel, we construct a fault-tolerant quantum signal processing algorithm for the core-hole Green's function, providing a scalable quantum route for simulating correlated core-level dynamics. Together, these developments establish complementary classical and quantum methodologies for quantitative, many-body-accurate core spectroscopy."}

In this work, we employ a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art numerical approaches to classically simulate the dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our methods include three different tensor network techniques -- matrix product states, tree-tensor networks, and two-dimensional tensor-networks under the belief propagation approximation -- as well as time-dependent variational Monte Carlo with Neural Quantum States. We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs.

Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space."}

We show that charged particles such as electrons and protons can exhibit O(1) latitude deviations at the ISCO radius and remain stable under synchrotron emission even for extremely small values of the black hole magnetic charge. We then extend the analysis to rotating MBHs, numerically computing the prograde and retrograde orbital branches and demonstrating how frame-dragging modifies their structure and stability regions.

Our results suggest that environments surrounding magnetically charged black holes can exhibit distinctive phenomenological signatures, with potential implications for black hole imaging and polarimetric observations."}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}

In the presence of such a non-metricity, the length of vectors is preserved under autoparallel transport. We obtain the field equations assuming a vanishing total scalar curvature, implemented by a Lagrange multiplier, and investigate their cosmological implications. To do this, we derive the generalized Friedmann equations which now have terms involving the non-metricity and the Lagrange multiplier. Then, we consider two distinct cosmological applications of the model. First of all, by adopting distinct forms of these two basic variables and investigate the possibility of the existence of warm inflationary scenarios within the framework of these models. In particular, we consider the case that the non-metricity is described by a constant vector, and we show that with this assumption we recover standard general relativity. The scenario in which the Lagrange multiplier is a constant is also investigated, and we show that radiation can be created during the very early phases of expansion. The amount of radiation peaks at a certain time after which, there is a transition from an accelerating inflationary phase to a decelerating one. Moreover, we perform a detailed comparison of the predictions of the considered Schrödinger type cosmology with a set of observational data for the Hubble function, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, by adopting a simple linear form for the Lagrange density.

However, the resultant states only approach Fock states and therefore do not exhibit quantum coherence. Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions. We extend this case to include an unsaturable absorber (oscillator) and analyse switching between linear and nonlinear absorptions, suitable for broad classes of experiments."}

During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime."}

We first analyze a driven two-photon emission process and show how doublon BICs arise and mediate decoherence-free interaction between distant atoms. We then demonstrate that these many-body BICs also emerge under natural, undriven dynamics via a virtual two-photon emission process in three-level giant atoms. Our results reveal an interference-based mechanism for stabilizing many-body localization in open quantum systems, with potential applications in quantum simulation, non-ergodic dynamics, and protected quantum information processing."}

We obtain that positive self-interaction terms increase the maximum mass and compactness of E-FLS stars, allowing them to reach masses comparable to the Chandrasekhar limit without the need of ultralight bosonic masses. Moreover, in the limit where the real scalar field becomes massless, the solutions present larger effective radii and allow a broader range of stable solutions.

However, experimental measurement of QMI remains extremely difficult, particularly for nonequilibrium states, which are more complex than ground states. In this Letter, we employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to establish a universal mapping between the QMI and local correlations only up to second order for nonequilibrium states generated by quenches in a one-dimensional disordered XXZ model. Our approach provides a practical method for experimentally extracting QMI, readily applicable in platforms such as superconducting qubits.

We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle.

The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it.

In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s.

This framework allows us to study how the Lévy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schrödinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\\pm π/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry.

We show that combining this flux-induced localization with engineered dissipation leads to robust spin synchronization in rotationally symmetric spin geometries, referred to as Aharonov-Bohm motifs, with cyclic symmetries of any order. The synchronized dynamics is independent of initial conditions and features entanglement among spins within each motif. We further demonstrate that multiple motifs can fully synchronize when coupled, which is achieved by applying additional collective dissipation acting on all intra-motif spins. These results reveal a direct connection between flux-induced localization, dissipative engineering, and collective quantum synchronization."}

These flows are such that they preserve the symplectic and the (information) metric geometries; they explain the linearity of quantum mechanics and the appearance of complex numbers. In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with local gauge symmetries. More specifically, on the basis of maximum entropy methods and information geometry, for an appropriate choice of ontic variables and constraints, we derive the quantum electrodynamics of radiation fields interacting with charged particles. As a test that despite its unorthodox foundation the ED approach is empirically successful we derive the Maxwell equations."}

Leveraging the flexibility and robustness of optimal control theory combined with underlying insights from effective Hamiltonian theory, we present a new family of broadband DNP pulse sequences, termed LOOP (Longitudinally Optimized with Overarching Periodicity), that alleviates the excitation-pulse challenge by accomplishing longitudinal polarization transfer. These sequences define robust single-spin effective $z$ rotations, with impressive compensation towards microwave field inhomogeneity, and are capable of delivering DNP transfer with bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz, while employing a peak microwave field amplitude of only 32 MHz, at an external magnetic field of 0.35 T."}

Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.\n  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era.

To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216 which suggested that there might be no local-realist ontological model for bilocal classical theory. Moreover, it is the first time that an ontological model has been constructed for a theory that fails to be locally tomographic, showing that the assumption of local tomography underpinning the structure theorem in doi.org/10.22331/q-2024-03-14-1283 is a genuine limitation of the theorem. This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable. This shows that the fundamental status of compositional properties (such as local tomography) is not a technical side-issue, but a central and unavoidable question for a coherent understanding even of classicality itself."}

Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$. Our theory aims to facilitate principled implementation of QNEs for measured relative entropies and guide hyperparameter tuning in practice."}

We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound."}

We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement."}

We construct the Krylov basis analytically by applying the Lanczos algorithm and evaluate both the Krylov state and operator complexity. In regimes where the wave function of the universe is sharply peaked, our results indicate that the Krylov complexity grows quadratically with the scalar field clock for the state and operator complexities in both the WDW quantum cosmology and LQC. We further show that operator complexity is exactly twice the state complexity in these regimes. We discuss the interpretation of the global behavior of these systems by calculating the Krylov entropy for both quantum cosmological frameworks. We observe that in LQC, the Krylov complexity and entropy remain finite at the bounce, whereas in the WDW quantum cosmology, they diverge at the big bang/crunch singularity. Our work paves the way for computing Krylov complexity in more intricate quantum cosmological models, including those exhibiting phenomena such as quantum chaos."}

Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property.

This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials."}

From the theoretical perspecive, its central object is the universal density functional which contains all intrinsic information about the quantum system in question. Once the external potential is provided, in principle one can obtain the exact ground-state energy via a simple minimization. However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network. The resulting neural network preserves the positivity and convexity of the exact functionals. More importantly, it is differentiable, so it can be directly used in a Kohn--Sham calculation."}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}
