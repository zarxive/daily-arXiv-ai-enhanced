Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quasi-probability decompositions (QPDs) have proven essential in many quantum algorithms and protocols -- one replaces a ``difficult'' quantum circuit with an ensemble of ``easier'' circuit variants whose weighted outcomes reproduce any target observable. This, however, inevitably yields an increased configuration variance beyond Born-rule shot noise. We develop a broad framework for accounting for and reducing this variance and prove that stratified sampling -- under ideal proportional allocation -- results in an unbiased estimator with a variance that is never worse than naïve sampling (with equality only in degenerate cases).
  Furthermore, we provide a classical dynamic programme to enable stratification on arbitrary product-form QPDs. Numerical simulations of typical QPDs, such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) and Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI), demonstrate constant-factor reductions in overall variance (up to $\sim 60$--$80\%$ in an oracle model) and robust $\sim 10\%$ savings in the pessimistic single-shot regime. Our results can be applied immediately to reduce the net sampling cost of practically relevant QPDs that are commonly used in near term and early fault-tolerant algorithms without requiring additional quantum resources.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum sensors based on nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been a central topic in the sensing community for more than a decade. The extraordinary properties at room temperature of the spin system in diamond have made it one of the most prominent quantum platforms for the development of commercial quantum sensors. In particular, the sensitivity of the electronic spin in NV centers has made diamond-based magnetic sensors of special interest for their potential application in medical, industrial or navigation solutions. However, the use of these sensors for universal vector magnetometry was constrained by the need for previous knowledge on the field being measured to fully exploit their benefits. In this work, we show a method to perform unconditional vector magnetometry without the need of external information on the magnetic field, based only on the spatial arrangement of the diamond and the microwave antenna combination. While previous NV-based vector magnetometry methods require partial knowledge of the magnetic field (e.g. a calibrated bias field), we exploit the possibilities of selecting particular directions of the spins in the diamond with elliptically polarized microwave fields. We prove that our method allows to estimate both magnitude and direction of external magnetic fields without further assumptions or constraints.

Abstract: In seminal work (arxiv:quant-ph/9707021) Alexei Kitaev proposed topological quantum computing (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:quant-ph/0001108, arXiv:0707.1889), whereby logic gates of a quantum computer are conducted by creating, braiding and fusing anyonic particles on a two-dimensional plane. Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development.

Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum algorithm for direct first-principles simulation of electron-nuclear dynamics on a first-quantized real-space grid. Our algorithm achieves best-in-class efficiency for block-encoding the pre-Born-Oppenheimer molecular Hamiltonian by harnessing the linear scaling of swap networks for implementing the quadratic number of particle interactions, while using a novel alternating sign implementation of the Coulomb interaction that exploits highly optimized arithmetic routines. We benchmark our approach for a series of scientifically and industrially relevant chemical reactions. We demonstrate over an order-of-magnitude reduction in costs compared to previous state-of-the-art for the $\rm NH_3+BF_3$ reaction, achieving a Toffoli cost of $8.7\times10^{9}$ per femtosecond using $1362$ logical qubits (system + ancillas). Our results significantly lower the resources required for fault-tolerant simulations of photochemical reactions, while providing a suite of algorithmic primitives that are expected to serve as foundational building blocks for a broader class of quantum algorithms.

### [5] [Experimental challenges and prospects for quantum-enhanced energy conversion: Stationary Fano coherence in V-type qutrits interacting with polarized incoherent radiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11695)
*Ludovica Donati,Francesco Saverio Cataliotti,Stefano Gherardini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the generation of Fano coherence in a three-level quantum system under polarized incoherent radiation, showing how it can be used for energy conversion and storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum coherence is a key resource for energy conversion technologies, and this study investigates its generation under specific conditions.

Method: The study employs the Bloch-Redfield equation derived from first principles, analyzing the reduced dynamics of a V-type three-level system under polarized incoherent radiation.

Result: The research identifies conditions for steady-state Fano coherence, characterizes its magnitude in different dynamical regimes, and evaluates its dependence on pumping intensity and energy splitting.

Conclusion: A three-level system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust coherence resource for energy conversion, with experimental feasibility using Rubidium atoms.

Abstract: Quantum coherence offers potential for energy conversion technologies. It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms.

Abstract: Resolving signals with closely spaced frequencies is central to applications in communications, spectroscopy and sensing. Recent results have shown that quantum sensing protocols can exhibit superresolution, the ability to discriminate between spectral lines with arbitrarily small frequency separation. Here, we revisit this problem from the perspective of quantum control theory, utilizing the filter function formalism to derive general, analytic conditions on quantum control protocols for achieving superresolution. Building on these conditions, we develop an optimal control framework, the utility of which is demonstrated through numerical identification of superresolution control protocols in the presence of realistic, experimentally-relevant constraints. We further extend our results to entangled initial states and assess their potential advantage. Our approach is broadly applicable to a wide variety of quantum sensing platforms, and it provides a systematic path to discover novel protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits in these systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Simulating chemical reactions is a central challenge in computational chemistry, characterized by an uneven difficulty profile: while equilibrium reactant and product geometries are often classically tractable, intermediate transition states frequently exhibit strong correlation that defies standard approximations. We present a protocol for dissipative ground state preparation that exploits this structure by treating the reaction path itself as a computational primitive. Our protocol uses an approach where a state prepared at a tractable geometry is propagated along a discretized reaction coordinate using Procrustes-aligned orbital rotations and stabilized by engineered dissipative cooling. We show that for reaction paths satisfying a localized Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) drift condition in the strongly correlated regime, the algorithm prepares ground states of chemical systems with $N_o$ orbitals to an energy error $ε_E$ with a total gate complexity scaling as $\widetilde{O}(N_o^{3}/ε_E)$. We provide logical resource estimates for benchmark systems including FeMoco, Cytochrome P450, and Ru-based carbon capture catalysts.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Maxwell's demon experimentally proves his prediction that photons with Bose-Einstein statistics can create a greater temperature difference in a quantum system compared to distinguishable photons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the intersection of thermodynamics, information theory, and quantum statistics.

Method: Using linear-optics with programmable measurement and feedback to manipulate photon states, demonstrating Bose-Einstein statistics impact on a system's thermodynamic state.

Result: Experimental support for Maxwell's claim, showing higher temperature differences with indistinguishable photons.

Conclusion: Significant step in understanding how information processing affects thermodynamic systems, potential for validating boson-sampling devices.

Abstract: Maxwell's demon elucidates the value of information in thermodynamics, using measurement and feedback: he evolves an equilibrated gas into a nonequilibrium state, from which one might extract work. The demon can evolve the system farther from equilibrium, on average, if the particles obey Bose-Einstein statistics than if they are distinguishable. We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics. Additionally, this work suggests a thermodynamic means of weakly validating boson-sampling platforms.

TL;DR: This paper describes an experimental platform that integrates cavity-mediated interactions with neutral-atom arrays to enable quantum network nodes and photonic-state engineering, addressing the challenge of combining Rydberg coupling with optical cavities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to solve the long-standing challenge of combining high-fidelity Rydberg arithhs with optical cavities for scalable quantum computing and networks.

Method: The researchers demonstrated strong coupling between atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array and a high-finesse optical cavity, achieving controlled excitation to Rydberg states and measuring the resulting dispersive shift.

Result: They observed the dispersive shift in the cavity's resonance and the collective enhancement of Rydberg couplings, confirming successful integration of cavity-mediated interactions with Rydberg arrays.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables new quantum technologies, including quantum simulation and photonic-state engineering, offering practical applications in quantum networks and computing.

Abstract: Scalable quantum computers and quantum networks require the combination of quantum processing nodes with efficient light-matter interfaces to distribute quantum information in local or long-distance quantum networks. Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces to photons. However, combining these two capabilities and coupling atom arrays to highly excited Rydberg states in the mode of an optical cavity has been an outstanding challenge. Here we present a novel cavity-coupled Rydberg array that achieves this long-standing goal. We prepare, detect, and control individual atoms in a scalable optical tweezer array, couple them strongly to the optical mode of a high-finesse optical cavity and excite them in a controlled way to Rydberg states. We show that strong coupling to an optical cavity - demonstrated via the dispersive shift of the resonance of the cavity in presence of the atoms - and strong Rydberg interactions - demonstrated via the collective enhancement of Rydberg coupling in the atomic array - can be achieved in our setup at the same spatial location. Our presented experimental platform opens the path to several new directions, including the realization of quantum network nodes, quantum simulation of long-range interacting, open quantum systems and photonic-state engineering leveraging high-fidelity Rydberg control.

Conclusion: Krylov子空间方法为研究量子系统中的激发态能隙行为提供了一个强有力的工具。

Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce \emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of quantum nonreciprocity induced via a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in an otherwise achiral, waveguide quantum electrodynamics. Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子干涉仪在导航、惯性测量和引力波探测等领域的广泛应用，噪声抑制是关键挑战。现有的基于信号相关的方法在理想条件下表现优异，但实际应用中往往受到噪声干扰，导致性能不理想。为此，我们需要一种在实际应用中更鲁棒的相位估计方法。

Method: 文章提出了PEAC方法，通过分析原子干涉仪中不同磁敏感亚态的特性，施加特定的拟合方法，针对幅值衰变的情况进行相位估计。PEAC方法通过在远离相位极值点处工作，结合幅值与相位的关系，提高了测量的真确性。

Result: PEAC在相关信号情况下，otropic比传统的工具减少了80%以上偏差，达到更高的精密度。而且，在相位极值点之外运行，显示了与现有方法相当的精度，打破了前人关于最佳操作点的理论。该方法在无需相位稳定性的前提下，能够广泛应用于相关干涉仪的评估，显著提升了整体的测量精度。

Conclusion: 本文的PEAC方法为基于信号相关性的干涉仪测量提供了一种更优的选择。与传统方法相比，PEAC在不依赖理想条件的情况下，能更精确地测量相位，拓展了其在多种实际应用中的可行性，如原子、分子、光子等的量子效应检测。这一突破性进展将显著提升量子干涉仪在高精度测量领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Operating matter-wave interferometers as quantum detectors for fundamental physics or inertial sensors in real-world applications with unprecedented accuracies relies on noise rejection, often implemented by correlating two sensors. Such sensors can be spatially separated (gradiometry or gravitational-wave detection) or consist of different internal states (magnetometry or quantum clock interferometry), in which case a signal-amplitude modulation may serve as a signature of a differential phase. In this work, we introduce Phase Estimation from Amplitude Collapse (PEAC) by applying targeted fitting methods for different magnetically sensitive substates of an atom interferometer. We demonstrate that PEAC provides higher trueness (up to 80% bias reduction) than standard tools for perfectly correlated signals. At its working point near, but not exactly at phase settings resulting in vanishing amplitude, it achieves precision competitive with standard methods, contrasting prior claims of optimal operation at vanishing amplitude. PEAC presents a generally applicable complementary evaluation method for correlated interferometers without phase stability, increasing the overall accuracy and enabling applications beyond atom interferometry.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算复杂性的 increase，整数线性规划问题在调度、物流和设计优化中扮演着重要角色，量子计算为求解这类问题提供了潜在的机会。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子约束编程提供了坚实的起点，为在组合优化问题中纳入更多量子加速奠定了基础。

Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) remains computationally challenging due to its NP-complete nature despite its central role in scheduling, logistics, and design optimization. We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\mathcal{O}(n\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 量子位群等价状态在量子信息处理中的重要性需要进一步确认。

Method: 通过分析 teleportation 和 superdense coding 协议的 LU 不变性，确定哪些状态适合这些协议。

Result: PTP 和 PSDC-2 是 LU 不变的，而 PSDC-3 不是。此外，Nielsen 的 teleportation 也不是 LU 不变的。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究如何利用这些发现优化量子通信协议。

Abstract: It is known that two local unitaries (LU) equivalent states possess the same amount of entanglement and can be used to perform the same tasks in quantum information theory (QIT). For a protocol for a task in QIT, we call a protocol LU invariant if two LU-equivalent states are either both suitable for the protocol or neither is. So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev. A, 74, 062320 (2006)], Agrawal and Pati proposed the perfect teleportation protocol (PTP) and the protocol for superdense coding to transmit 2-bit classical information by sending one qubit (PSDC-2) and 3-bit classical information by sending two qubits (PSDC-3). In this paper, we show that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU invariant. That is, two LU equivalent states are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 or neither of them is. We show that PSDC-3 is not LU invariant. We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively. Via the LU invariance of PTP and PSDC-2, we prove that a state is suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 if and only if it has 1 ebit of shared entanglement, respectively and find all genuine entangled states and separable states which are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2, respectively. So far, no one has indicated that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement. Agrawal and Pati suggested to study if there are subclasses of W SLOCC class which are suitable for PSDC-3. So far, it still remains an unsolved question. We show that any state of the SLOCC class W is not suitable for PSDC-3.

Abstract: Besides well-known conditions of locality or factorisability, deriving the Bell inequalities requires assuming that the distribution of hidden variables and Alice's and Bob's measurement settings be independent of each other. We show that (analogously to violations of locality due to action at a distance) certain violations of this Measurement Independence assumption can be associated with a notion of signalling in principle, thus making them also testable in principle, and spell out the appropriate conditions. Accordingly, we show that by imposing no-signalling one can prove a version of Bell's theorem that does not require the assumption of Measurement Independence. We discuss the "Schulman model" as an example, as well as lessons for "experimental metaphysics".

Abstract: Entangling interactions between distant qubits can be mediated via an additional degree of freedom. In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.
  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string. Through several explicit examples, we highlight the advantages over existing magnetic-gradient schemes and show how gates on multiple ion pairs can be carried out simultaneously.

Conclusion: 总结了VQE在量子计算中的现状及未来发展方向。

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm has been developed to target near term Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers as a method to find the eigenvalues of Hamiltonians. Unlike fully quantum algorithms such as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), VQE based methods are hybrid algorithms that utilize both quantum and classical hardware to combat issues with the near term quantum hardware such as small numbers of available qubits and the decoherence of qubits. Different adaptations (flavors) of VQE have been implemented to combat these scalability issues on NISQ devices compared to standard VQE. These different flavors are modifications of the underlying VQE ansatz to reduce the computational workload on the quantum hardware. In this review we focus on 3 main areas related to VQE. The first focus is on flavors of VQE that fall under the categories of circuit complexity reduction, chemistry inspired ansatz, and extensions of VQE to excited states. The remaining portion of the review focuses on benchmarking the accuracy of VQE methods and an overview of the current state of quantum simulators.

Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of the exotic Landau model in a two-dimensional noncommutative plane. Beginning with the classical formulation where two conserved quantities $\mathcal{P}_i$ and $\mathcal{K}_i$ are derived, we proceed to the quantum level where these lead to two independent oscillator representations generating bosonic Fock spaces $Γ_{\mathcal{P}}$ and $Γ_{\mathcal{K}}$. Coherent states satisfying all Klauder's criteria are explicitly constructed, and their physical properties including normalization, continuity, resolution of the identity, temporal stability, and action identity are rigorously proven. We further develop matrix vector coherent states and quaternionic vector coherent states, examining their mathematical structure and physical implications. Detailed calculations of the free particle propagator via path integrals, uncertainty relations, and time evolution of probability densities are provided.

We detail recent implementations of room-temperature sources of quantum light based on the high second- and third-order optical nonlinearities of the material, as well as photonic circuits embedding various functionalities ranging from polarizing beamsplitters to Mach-Zehnder interferometers, modulators and tunable filters. We then present several realizations of quantum state engineering enabled by these recent advances and discuss open perspectives and remaining challenges in the field of integrated quantum photonics with AlGaAs.

Abstract: Superradiant biphoton emission from atomic ensembles provides a powerful route to generating highly correlated quantum light, yet its microscopic physical origin has remained incompletely understood. In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the microscopic sources of TLS in Josephson junctions is crucial for improving the scalability of quantum processors, as TLS can disrupt superconducting qubits and affect quantum computing performance.

Method: A high-throughput, data-driven approach was employed, involving the creation of a massive dataset of Josephson junctions and atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. Statistical analysis was used to correlate fabrication parameters with TLS occurrence.

Result: The study found a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Reducing electrode thickness and grain size led to a significant decrease in TLS density by two-thirds.

Conclusion: This methodology provides a robust framework for identifying and controlling microstructural defects in quantum circuits, paving the way for improved scalability and reduced TLS density in superconducting Josephson junctions.

Abstract: Materials defects in Josephson junctions (JJs), often referred to as two-level systems (TLS), couple to superconducting qubits and are a critical bottleneck for scalable quantum processors. Despite their importance, understanding the microscopic sources of TLS and how to mitigate them has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput, correlated approach to trace the microstructural origins of strongly-coupled TLS in Josephson circuits. We assembled a massive dataset of TLS across 6,000 Al/AlOx/Al JJs and more than 600 atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy images. We statistically link fabrication, microstructure, and TLS occurrence, revealing a strong correlation between Al electrode thickness, Al grain size, and TLS density. Correspondingly, we find a two-thirds reduction in TLS prompted by a change in electrode fabrication parameters. These results demonstrate a robust, data-driven methodology to understand and control defects in quantum circuits and pave the way for significantly reducing TLS density.

Abstract: The realisation of utility-scale quantum computing inextricably depends on the design of practical, low-overhead fault-tolerant architectures. We introduce the \textit{Pinnacle Architecture}, which uses quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes to allow for universal, fault-tolerant quantum computation with a spacetime overhead significantly smaller than that of any competing architecture. With this architecture, we show that 2048-bit RSA integers can be factored with less than one hundred thousand physical qubits, given a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, code cycle time of $1$ \textmu s and a reaction time of $10$ \textmu s. We thereby demonstrate the feasibility of utility-scale quantum computing with an order of magnitude fewer physical qubits than has previously been believed necessary.

The double-resonator coupler superconducting quantum circuit has the advantage of simple fabrications, introducing less flux noises, reducing occupancy of dilution refrigerator cables, which might supply a promising platform for future large-scale superconducting quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum Byzantine Agreement (QBA), a cornerstone of quantum blockchain, offers inherent advantages in security and fault tolerance over classical protocols, guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. However, existing multiparty QBA protocols face challenges for large-scale deployment due to exponential communication complexity or reliance on complex multi-particle entanglement. To address this, we propose a multiparty circular QBA protocol that adopts a semi-decentralized architecture, leveraging circular message gathering and quantum digital signatures to achieve quadratic communication complexity and enhanced fault tolerance. Our protocol is experimentally feasible, requiring only weak coherent states, and is compatible with existing star-shaped quantum networks. Simulations conducted on a global satellite-to-ground network demonstrate that the protocol sustains high consensus rates among multiple users, even when employing different key generation protocols under realistic conditions. This work presents a scalable framework for large-scale QBA networks, establishing the foundation for a practical quantum blockchain that enables secure and fault-tolerant decentralized services.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce constructions for non-Abelian qLDPC codes obtained by gauging transversal Clifford gates using measurement and feedback. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian Clifford stabilizer code, whose stabilizers are reminiscent of the action of a Type-III twisted quantum double. Our second approach applies to general qLDPC codes, and uses a graph of ancilla qubits which may be tailored to properties of the input codes to gauge a single transversal gate. For both constructions, the resulting gauged codes are shown to have properties analogous to 2D non-Abelian topological order -- e.g. the analog of a single anyon on a torus. We conclude by demonstrating that our gauging procedures enable magic state preparation via the measurement of logical Clifford gates. Consequently, our gauging constructions offer a protocol for performing non-Clifford operations on any qLDPC code.

Abstract: We show that a single spatially superposed 'source' mass acting on a 'probe' matter wavepacket can reveal the quantum nature of the gravitational field. For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A central task in quantum information science is state certification: testing whether an unknown state is $ε_1$-close to a fixed target state, or $ε_2$-far. Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $ε_1$, they can only positively certify states within $ε_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.
  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $ε_1=Θ(1)$, using a single $O(\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $ε_1=Ω(1/\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Distributed architectures are gaining prominence in quantum machine learning as a means to overcome hardware limitations and enable scalable quantum information processing. In this context, we analyze the design and performance of distributed Quantum Extreme Learning Machine (QELM) architectures for learning functions of quantum states directly from data, restricting measurements to easily implementable projective measurements in the computational basis. The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, Rényi entropy, and entanglement measures. Our results demonstrate that the distributed design enables the reconstruction of higher-order nonlinearities by increasing the number of interacting subsystems with reduced resources, rather than increasing the size of an individual reservoir, providing a scalable and hardware-efficient route to quantum property learning.

Abstract: Space-based distribution of quantum entanglement will be essential for global quantum networking and secure communications. Modelling and analysis of the performance of satellite entanglement pair distribution is important for the architecture and design of constellations and space systems. Entanglement-based quantum key distribution, in the absence of quantum repeaters, is especially prone to finite key effects due to low coincident count rates compared to trusted node single-path links. Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations. These results provide quantitative performance bounds and design guidelines for near-term SatQKD missions, enabling informed trade-offs between satellite payload complexity, ground infrastructure, and achievable secure key throughput.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We propose a recipe to transform any depth-L CNOT block preparing n-qubit GHZ states into an n-qubit fanout gate of depth 2L-1 without ancilla qubits, achieving logarithmic-depth fanout gates. This method matches complexity theory constructions and can be adapted to heavy-hex constraints like ibm_fez, yielding a 156-qubit fanout with depth 33. Additionally, our fanout constructions enable efficient measurement of Pauli observables, allowing single-shot characterization of GHZ-like states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum circuit optimization is crucial for practical quantum computing, especially for minimizing circuit depths and reducing resource usage. Efficient fanout gates and GHZ states are fundamental components in many quantum algorithms, making efficient constructions particularly valuable for near-term quantum hardware.

Method: Our method involves transforming a depth-L CNOT block into a fanout gate of depth 2L-1 without ancilla qubits. This technique leverages known logarithmic-depth circuits for GHZ states and applies it to fanout gate constructions, including adaptations to specific hardware constraints such as ibm_fez's heavy-hex connectivity restrictions.

Result: We successfully constructed a 156-qubit fanout gate with a depth of 33 on ibm_fez. Additionally, our fanout constructions enable efficient measurement of commuting observables, allowing for single-shot characterization of GHZ-like states, such as a 156-qubit GHZ state, with a circuit depth of 33 on ibm_fez.

Conclusion: Our work provides practical methods for constructing efficient fanout gates and GHZ states without ancilla qubits, matching theoretical lower bounds and adapting to specific hardware architectures. These constructions enable optimized resource usage and efficient characterization of quantum states in practical settings.

Abstract: We propose a practical recipe to transform any depth-$L$ block of CNOTs that prepares $n$-qubit GHZ states into an $n$-qubit fanout gate (multitarget-CNOT) of depth $2L-1$, without the need for ancilla qubits. Considering known logarithmic-depth circuits to prepare GHZ-states, this allows us to construct an $n$-qubit fanout gate with depth $2\log_2(n)-1$, reproducing previous ancillaless constructions. We employ our recipe to construct $n$-qubit fanout gates under heavy-hex connectivity restrictions, obtaining a depth of $O(n^{1/2})$, again reproducing previous complexity theory constructions. Using this recipe on the \textit{ibm\_fez} architecture yields a $156$-qubit fanout construction with depth $33$. Additionally, we show how to employ these $n$-qubit fanout constructions to measure complete sets of commuting observables from the $n$-body Pauli group with the same depth, allowing for efficient single-shot characterization of any GHZ-like state in a given known basis, e.g. fully characterizing a single copy of a $156$-qubit GHZ state using circuit depth $33$ in $\textit{ibm\_fez}$ (its preparation requires an additional depth of $17$).

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study sequential quantum changepoint detection in settings where the pre- and post-change regimes are specified through constraints on the expectation values of a finite set of observables. We consider an architecture with separate measurement and detection modules, and assume that the observables relevant to the detector are unknown to the measurement device. For this scenario, we introduce shadow-based sequential changepoint e-detection (eSCD), a novel protocol that combines a universal measurement strategy based on classical shadows with a nonparametric sequential test built on e-detectors. Classical shadows provide universality with respect to the detector's choice of observables, while the e-detector framework enables explicit control of the average run length (ARL) to false alarm. Under an ARL constraint, we establish finite-sample guarantees on the worst-case expected detection delay of eSCD. Numerical experiments validate the theory and demonstrate that eSCD achieves performance competitive with observable-specific measurement strategies, while retaining full measurement universality.

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems leverage an expanded Hilbert space to enhance resilience against decoherence and noise. However, standard quantum teleportation is fundamentally limited by the quadratic growth of measurement complexity and high classical communication overhead, requiring the resolution of $d^2$ Bell states and $2\log_2 d$ classical bits. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient high-dimensional coherence teleportation (REHDCT) protocol. By designing $d$ sets of specialized positive operator-valued measure (POVM) bases, our protocol achieves a 50\% reduction in classical communication by utilizing one of the $d$ designed POVM sets, which effectively scales the measurement complexity from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing initial phase engineering to align the target qudit with the measurement basis, theoretically perfect teleportation of quantum coherence can be achieved for arbitrary qudit states. A quantitative robustness analysis reveals that the protocol remains highly resilient to operational errors, maintaining an efficiency above 99.6\% even under a 0.1 rad phase deviation for $d=16$. Our analysis under various noise models (amplitude damping, phase flip, depolarizing, and dit-flip) confirms that high-dimensional systems exhibit an expanding quantum advantage window as dimensionality increases. Notably, under dit-flip noise, perfect coherence teleportation can be restored through the optimal selection of the POVM basis. These findings establish REHDCT as a practical, hardware-friendly framework for resource-efficient quantum communication in future high-dimensional networks.

The Rider-Order Assignment problem is a practically motivated optimization problem arising in online food delivery and related logistics applications. While the problem is closely related to the classical matching problem, the inclusion of realistic operational constraints renders it computationally challenging.

Abstract: Superconducting qubit parameters drift on sub-second timescales, motivating calibration and benchmarking techniques that can be executed on millisecond timescales. We demonstrate an on-FPGA workflow that co-locates pulse generation, data acquisition, analysis, and feed-forward, eliminating CPU round trips. Within this workflow, we introduce sparse-sampling and on-FPGA inference tools, including computationally efficient methods for estimation of exponential and sine-like response functions, as well as on-FPGA implementations of Nelder-Mead optimization and golden-section search. These methods enable low-latency primitives for readout calibration, spectroscopy, pulse-amplitude calibration, coherence estimation, and benchmarking. We deploy this toolset to estimate $T_1$ in 10 ms, optimize readout parameters in 100 ms, optimize pulse amplitudes in 1 ms, and perform Clifford randomized gate benchmarking in 107 ms on a flux-tunable superconducting transmon qubit. Running a closed-loop on-FPGA recalibration protocol continuously for 6 hours enables more than 74,000 consecutive recalibrations and yields gate errors that consistently retain better performance than the baseline initial calibration. Correlation analysis shows that recalibration suppresses coupling of gate error to control-parameter drift while preserving a coherence-linked performance. Finally, we quantify uncertainty versus time-to-decision under our sparse sampling approaches and identify optimal parameter regimes for efficient estimation of qubit and pulse parameters.

Abstract: Quantum subspace diagonalization and quantum Krylov algorithms offer a feasible, pre- or early-fault tolerant alternative to quantum phase estimation for using quantum computers to estimate the low-lying spectra of quantum systems. However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for preparing Matrix Product States (MPS) that combines heuristic and variational optimization methods to efficiently prepare arbitrary quantum states with significant scaling improvements over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preparation of quantum states with high accuracy and efficiency is crucial for various quantum computing applications, particularly in the context of near-term quantum devices where resources are limited.

Method: The framework combines heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits with variational optimization methods. It also incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering and low-level optimizations to reduce circuit depths and CNOT counts.

Result: Experiments show that optimized brick wall circuits achieve the lowest depths, while optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. The framework enables high-fidelity state preparation for large systems with trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPS as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Preparing arbitrary quantum states requires exponential resources. Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. Overall, our results provide principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPSs as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于多参数量子 metrology 中边界可达性的重要见解，并为后续研究提供了方向性的指导。

Abstract: The quantum Cramér-Rao (QCR) bound sets the ultimate local precision limit for unbiased multiparameter estimation. Yet, unlike in the single-parameter case, its saturability is not generally guaranteed and is often assessed through commutativity-based conditions. Here, we resolve the logical hierarchy of these commutativity conditions for unitary parameter-encoding transformations. We identify strict gaps between them, uncover previously assumed but missing implications, and construct explicit counterexamples to characterize the boundaries between distinct classes. In particular, we show that commutativity of the parameter-encoding generators alone does not ensure the saturability of the QCR bound once realistic noise produces mixed probe states. Our results provide a systematic classification of saturability conditions in multiparameter quantum metrology and clarify fundamental precision limits in noisy distributed quantum sensing beyond idealized pure-state settings.

TL;DR: A scalable protocol for creating high-excitation coherent states in quantum optics with improved error resistance and optimization simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-excitation coherent states in quantum optics are essential for technologies like quantum computing and metrology, but their creation is technically sustainable.

Method: Using resonant subspace engineering (RSE), a protocol is mathematically derived to constrain quantum state dynamics into a two-dimensional subspace, allowing controlled rotation and state transfer.

Result: RSE achieves a $O(n^{1/4})$ scaling in evolution time and gate depth, making it highly efficient for single Fock states, generalizes to multi-qubit states, and reduces resource requirements for large-scale systems.

Conclusion: RSE offers a crucial framework for quantum state engineering by leveraging subspace dynamics under resonance and phase-matching conditions, providing a scalable solution for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: Deterministic preparation of high-excitation Fock states is a central challenge in bosonic quantum information, with control complexity that generically explodes as the Hilbert space dimension grows. Here we introduce resonant subspace engineering (RSE), a protocol that analytically confines the infinite-dimensional bosonic dynamics to a two-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by an initial coherent state and the target state. State transfer then reduces to a geodesic rotation on a synthetic Bloch sphere, governed by resonance and phase-matching conditions we derive in closed form. For single Fock states, RSE achieves $O(n^{1/4})$ scaling in both evolution time and gate depth, showing a fundamental improvement over existing deterministic schemes. The construction generalizes to $K$-component superpositions via a $(K{+}1)$-dimensional invariant subspace with full $\mathrm{SU}(K{+}1)$ controllability, requiring only 3-5 iterations of operations for superpositions spanning photon numbers 70--100. RSE provides a scalable and analytically transparent framework for large-scale bosonic state engineering and gate synthesis across single- and multimode platforms.

Abstract: Analytical and algebraic geometry are valuable tools for dealing with problems involving analytical functions and polynomials. In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing the source of a target signal, or evaluating the field (or a derivative thereof) in an arbitrary position. In this work we also link this problem to networks of quantum sensors, and the role and usefulness of entangling these sensors. We find that the estimators that come out as a solution to the problem are such that a non-local entangled strategy provides maximum precision. We start by working under the assumption of polynomial fields, which relates to the interpolation problem, and then generalize for any signal that is modeled via analytical functions, giving rise to any general least-squares estimator. We discuss the effects of the placement of the sensors in the estimation, namely, how to find well defined, construction error-free placements for the sensors. In the case of interpolation we provide concrete examples and proofs in a $m$-dimensional array of sensors, and discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for the more general cases. We provide clear examples of the possible use-cases and statements, and compare a non-local entangled strategy with the best local strategy for an interpolation problem, showing the benefit in terms of precision in a distributed sensing scenario. This is a key tool for a wide-range of problem in sensing problems, ranging from large-scale such as earth-sized experiments, to local-scale, such has biological experiments.

Abstract: Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by the quantum Fisher information. On each leaf we construct the least-biased state compatible with normalization and mean energy, defining a leaf-canonical ensemble. The Gibbs ensemble is recovered on the distinguished commuting leaf, while generic states are organized by their leaf label. This structure provides a natural setting to extend eigenstate thermalization beyond equilibrium via a "leaf typicality" hypothesis. According to that hypothesis, under unitary time evolution local observables depend only on the leaf and energy and, at all times, are reproduced by evolving a representative (pure) state drawn from the optimal ensemble.

TL;DR: This paper studies the discriminant power of projective measurements with post-measurement states and demonstrates that considering Lüders' instrument can help distinguish some measurements to infinite advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discriminating quantum measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum information, with applications in quantum metrology and quantum communication.

Method: Mathematical analysis using positive-operator valued measures and Lüders instruments; derivation of a lower bound for the discrimination bias ratio.

Result: When post-measurement states are taken into account, distinguishing some binary projective measurements can have arbitrarily large bias improvement compared to when states are ignored.

Conclusion: Means of improving discrimination through considering post-measurement data can render some measurement pairs distinguishable infinitely better than previously thought possible.

Abstract: The standard approach to quantum measurement discrimination is to perform the given unknown measurement on a probe state, possibly entangled with an auxiliary system, and make a decision based on the measurement outcome obtained. In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measurement quantum state. More specifically, instead of considering only the positive-operator valued measure (POVM) operators, we consider their associated Lüders' instrument associated with them. We prove that, when the post-measurement quantum states are available, the task of discriminating two qubit projective measurements is equivalent to discriminating two copies of quantum states associated to each projector pair, extending previous results known for the case where probe states are separable. Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination.

Abstract: Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states.

Conclusion: 该研究通过反应扩散方程构建了一个新的模型，能够解释微生物群体在资源限制下的sublinear增长现象。该模型不仅丰富了反应扩散方程的应用领域，也为理解微生物群落的复杂动力学行为提供了新的理论框架。这些发现对生物学、生态学以及相关的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion equations describe various spatially extended processes that unfold as traveling fronts moving at constant velocity. We introduce and solve analytically a model that, besides such fronts, supports solutions advancing as the square root of time. These sublinear fronts preserve an invariant shape, with an effective diffusion constant that diverges at the transition to linear spreading. The model applies to dense cellular aggregates of nonmotile cells consuming a diffusible nutrient. The sublinear spread results from biomass redistribution slowing due to nutrient depletion, a phenomenon supported experimentally but often neglected. Our results provide a potential explanation for the linear rather than quadratic increase of colony area with time, which has been observed for many microbes.

Abstract: Objective. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a fundamental mechanism underlying learning and memory, yet its investigation at the network level in vitro remains challenging, particularly when optogenetic stimulation is used. The objective of this work is to develop a robust experimental and analytical framework for inducing and quantifying optogenetically driven LTP in neuronal cultures recorded with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Approach. We first systematically investigate the effect of widefield optogenetic stimulation frequency on evoked neuronal activity, to identify a test-stimulus that reliably probes network responses without inducing activity modulation. By analyzing spike-rate dynamics during repeated stimulation, we characterize frequency-dependent response adaptation consistent with Channelrhodopsin-2 photocycle kinetics. Based on these results, an optimized low-frequency test-stimulus is selected and combined with a spatially confined tetanic optogenetic stimulation to induce LTP. Network responses are quantified using post-stimulus time histograms and a normalized efficacy metric, enabling electrode-wise and network-level analysis of plasticity. Main results. Low-frequency optical stimulation (<= 0.2 Hz) preserves stable evoked responses, whereas higher frequencies induce a pronounced sigmoid-like decay in firing rate. Following tetanic stimulation, a subset of electrodes exhibits robust and long-lasting potentiation, persisting for several hours. Significance. This work provides a systematic methodology for studying activity-dependent plasticity in optogenetically driven neuronal networks.

Abstract: Odd-parity magnetism has attracted significant interest for its unconventional spin splitting. However, a concrete microscopic route for its realization remains elusive. In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory. Our results establish van der Waals heterostructures as a practical platform for non-relativistic spintronics with electric control of odd-parity spin textures.

Abstract: Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究介绍了量子晶格系统中的分层对称算符和分层异常，作为 onsite对称性算符和 onsite射影表示的推广。分层对称算符可以通过相互独立的子系统对称算符分层因子化，其分层异常定义为这些子对称算符的相关异常集合。开发了基于胞腔链复形的分层对称内群的异常理论，并表明在具有晶体群对称性的存在下，分层异常会产生李布-施 Shankar-马蒂丝 (LSM) 约束，包括 LSM 异常和 SPT-LSM 定理。应用于模化 $G$ 对称性，后者是指总对称群 $G_	ext{tot} = G times G_	ext{s}$ 的对称性，其中 $G_	ext{s}$ 是晶体群。特别地，分层异常非零在 $G_	ext{s}$ 基本域（例如一个单元格）中并不总是导致模化对称的 LSM 约束。${LSM}$ 异常的存在与否还取决于 $G_	ext{s}$ 如何作用于 $G$。当 $G_	ext{s}$ 是晶格平移群时，我们得出一个明确的准则，说明分层异常引起 LSM 异常的条件，并使用 $G_	ext{s}$-不变的胞腔链来分类 LSM 异常。通过一维和二维的例子，包括指数和偶极对称性具有分层异常的情况，说明了该准则。还构建了一个受 SPT-LSM 定理约束的模化 SPT 的稳定器代码模型。

Abstract: We introduce stratified symmetry operators and stratified anomalies in quantum lattice systems as generalizations of onsite symmetry operators and onsite projective representations. A stratified symmetry operator is a symmetry operator that factorizes into mutually independent subsystem symmetry operators; its stratified anomaly is defined as the collection of anomalies associated with these subsystem operators. We develop a cellular chain complex formalism for stratified anomalies of internal symmetries and show that, in the presence of crystalline symmetries, they give rise to Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) constraints. This includes LSM anomalies and SPT-LSM theorems. We apply this framework to modulated $G$ symmetries, which are symmetries whose total symmetry group is ${G_\mathrm{tot} = G \rtimes G_\mathrm{s}}$, with $G_\mathrm{s}$ the crystalline symmetry group. Notably, a nonzero stratified anomaly within a fundamental domain of $G_\mathrm{s}$ (e.g., a unit cell) does not always imply an LSM anomaly for modulated symmetries. Instead, the existence of an LSM anomaly also depends on how $G_\mathrm{s}$ acts on $G$. When $G_\mathrm{s}$ is the lattice translation group, we find an explicit criterion for when a stratified anomaly causes an LSM anomaly, and classify LSM anomalies using homology groups of $G_\mathrm{s}$-invariant cellular chains. We illustrate this through examples of exponential and dipole symmetries with stratified anomalies, both in ${(1+1)}$D and ${(2+1)}$D, and construct a stabilizer code model of a modulated SPT subject to an SPT-LSM theorem.

Abstract: Three-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields host partially flat bands that disperse along the field direction yet exhibit Landau-level quantization in the transverse dimensions. Early work established that for spin-polarized electrons confined to the lowest Landau level band, repulsion triggers a charge density wave (CDW) in which electrons 'self-layer' into integer quantum Hall states, while attraction generates a non-Fermi liquid (rather than a superconductor). We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers. These results expand the rich phenomenology of interacting bulk electrons in the high-field regime and potentially inform the design of field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of the $T$-linear specific heat in pressurized and magnetized Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, we perform the state-of-the-art thermal tensor-network computation on the Shastry-Sutherland model under a magnetic field. Our simulation results suggest the existence of a symmetric intermediate phase with $T$-linear specific heat at low temperature, occupying a large parameter space and separating the plaquette-singlet phase and antiferromagnetic phase at low fields and other symmetry-breaking phases at high fields before the system is fully polarized. Such an unexpected novel state bears an astonishing similarity to the experimental findings in the material. It opens the door to further investigations of the possible liberation of deconfined magnetized Dirac spinons by the competing interactions in this highly frustrated quantum magnet model, and by the combined effects of magnetic field and pressure in the the associated Shastry-Sutherland Mott insulator SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$.

Abstract: We have experimentally investigated the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) of a prototype spin-frustrated one-dimensional spin-chain system, the famous Haldane-chain system, R2BaNiO5 (R = Nd, Gd, Er, Dy). The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively. Our study presents a pathway for tuning MCE switching and the MCE effect over large temperature regions in d-f coupled spin-frustrated and spin-chain oxide systems.

Abstract: Inspired by recent discovery of metallic $d$-wave altermagnetism in KV$_2$Se$_2$O, we develop a self-consistent microscopic many-body calculation of density-wave order for an itinerant altermagnetic metal. We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce the key features observed in the spectroscopic measurements, offering a consistent and generic understanding of the reported phenomena in KV$_2$Se$_2$O and, more broadly, in metallic altermagnets with strong spin-momentum locking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the conditions under which quantum systems are gapless is crucial for comprehending their physical properties, especially when symmetry plays an active role.

Method: Construct symmetry spans with configurations where a global symmetry E is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries (D and C). Gapped phases must arise as restrictions of gapped phases of these larger symmetries.

Result: A mechanism for enforcing gaplessness using only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, realizable on lattices, is discovered. Concrete examples are provided in 1+1D, conformal field theories, and lattice models, demonstrating the mechanism's applicability.

Conclusion: This mechanism offers a systematic approach to proving gaplessness in various quantum systems under specific symmetry conditions, with a wide range of applications and potential implications for condensed matter and high-energy physics.

Abstract: Anomaly matching for continuous symmetries has been the primary tool for establishing symmetry enforced gaplessness - the phenomenon where global symmetry alone forces a quantum system to be gapless in the infrared. We introduce a new mechanism based on \textit{symmetry spans}: configurations in which a global symmetry $\mathcal{E}$ is simultaneously embedded into two larger symmetries, as $\mathcal{D}\hookleftarrow\mathcal{E}\hookrightarrow\mathcal{C}$. Any gapped phase with the full symmetry must, upon restriction to $\mathcal{E}$, arise as the restriction of both a gapped $\mathcal{C}$-symmetric phase and a gapped $\mathcal{D}$-symmetric phase. When no such compatible phase exists, gaplessness is enforced. This mechanism can operate with only discrete and non-anomalous continuous symmetries in the UV, both of which admit well-understood lattice realizations. We construct explicit symmetry spans enforcing gaplessness in 1+1 dimensions, exhibit their realization in conformal field theories, and provide lattice Hamiltonians with the relevant symmetry embeddings.

Abstract: We investigate the spectral statistics of an interacting fermionic system derived by projecting the Hubbard interaction onto the two lowest-energy, degenerate flat bands of the dice lattice subjected to a $π$-flux. Surprisingly, the distributions of level spacings and gap ratios correspond to distinct Gaussian ensembles, depending on the parity of the particle number. For an even number of particles, the spectra conform to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, as expected for a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian. In stark contrast, the odd-parity sector exhibits exact double degeneracy of all eigenstates even after resolving all known symmetries, and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble accurately describes the spacing distribution between these doublets. The simultaneous emergence of two different random-matrix ensembles within a single physical system constitutes an unprecedented finding, opening new avenues for both random matrix theory and flat-band physics.

Abstract: We report calorimetric, magnetic, and neutron scattering studies on an S = 5/2, nearly Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K2Mn(SeO3)2 with weak XXZ easy-axis anisotropy. Multiple magnetic phases are identified, including a non-collinear Y phase in zero field, a field-induced collinear m = 1/3 magnetization plateau, and a high-field V phase. In the Y phase, the magnetic excitation spectrum exhibits both single-magnon excitations and an extended high-energy continuum. Both features are well described by non-linear spin wave theory. In the field-induced phases, complex effects of the spectrum renormalization even for large S = 5/2 material are clearly detectable. These results underscore the essential role of magnon-magnon interactions in the dynamics of large-S Heisenberg spin systems on a triangular lattice.

Abstract: We propose an index of non-invertible symmetry operators in 1+1 dimensions and discuss its relation to the realizability of non-invertible symmetries on the tensor product of finite dimensional on-site Hilbert spaces on the lattice. Our index generalizes the Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner index of invertible symmetry operators represented by quantum cellular automata (QCAs). Assuming that all fusion channels of symmetry operators have the same index, we show that the fusion rules of finitely many symmetry operators on a tensor product Hilbert space can agree, up to QCAs, only with those of weakly integral fusion categories. We also discuss an attempt to establish an index theory for non-invertible symmetries within the framework of tensor networks. To this end, we first propose a general class of matrix product operators (MPOs) that describe non-invertible symmetries on a tensor product Hilbert space. These MPOs, which we refer to as topological injective MPOs, include all invertible symmetries, non-anomalous fusion category symmetries, and the Kramers-Wannier symmetries for finite abelian groups. For topological injective MPOs, we construct the defect Hilbert spaces and the corresponding sequential quantum circuit representations. We also show that all fusion channels of topological injective MPOs have the same index if there exist fusion and splitting tensors that satisfy appropriate conditions. The existence of such fusion and splitting tensors has not been proven in general, although we construct them explicitly for all examples of topological injective MPOs listed above.

Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

Abstract: Topological boundary modes, a hallmark of quantum topological phases, remarkably occur in classical mechanical systems through an interesting correspondence with the quantum case. Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders.

Abstract: Molecular polaritons have drawn great interest in recent years as a possible avenue for providing optical control over chemical dynamics. A central challenge in the field is to identify physical phenomena that require a quantum rather than a classical treatment of electrodynamics. In this work, we use our recently developed mean-field quantum (mfq) and full-quantum (fq) real-time nuclear--electronic orbital (RT-NEO) time-dependent density functional theory methods to simulate polaritonic dynamics for a molecule under vibrational strong coupling when a quantized cavity mode is initialized in a Fock state rather than a coherent state. Our previous work showed that a coherent state initial condition for the cavity mode leads to polariton formation for both the mfq-RT-NEO and fq-RT-NEO methods. Herein, we show that the mfq-RT-NEO method, which does not allow light--matter entanglement, does not predict polariton formation for a Fock state initial condition. Similar to the mfq-RT-NEO method, the fq-RT-NEO method does not predict oscillations of the cavity mode coordinate and molecular dipole operator expectation values for a Fock state initial condition. However, the fq-RT-NEO method does predict oscillations of the expectation values of even powers of these operators as well as light--matter entanglement, implicating polariton formation with a Fock state initial condition. All these observations can be explained with model systems. These results suggest that using a quantized cavity mode initial condition that does not have a direct analogy to an initial condition in classical electrodynamics can lead to physical phenomena that can only be described by a quantum treatment of the cavity mode.

Abstract: Quantum-state-controlled reactivity is a long-standing goal in the field of physical chemistry. In this work, we explore the vibrational-state-dependent behavior of the ion-molecule reaction between O2+ in distinct vibrational states and two isomers of C3H4, allene (H2C3H2) and propyne (H3C3H). While most products are formed regardless of the vibrational state of O2+, the branching ratios are influenced by vibrational excitation, and a new product, C2O+, appears exclusively in the excited-state reactions. This selective formation of C2O+ demonstrates that vibrational excitation can effectively activate a reaction pathway, providing direct evidence of quantum-state control in reactivity. These results represent an important step towards the goal of quantum-state-controlled chemistry in molecular systems.

Motivation: Acceleration of electronic-structure simulations for sustainability and efficiency.

Method: Hardware-native FPGA implementation of EHT and DFTB0 using streaming dataflow for deterministic execution.

Result: DFTB0 achieves over fourfold throughput improvement over mid-range CPUs.

Conclusion: FPGA-based acceleration offers a pathway for hardware-native methods in quantum chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: High-throughput quantum-chemical calculations underpin modern molecular modelling, materials discovery, and machine-learning workflows, yet even semi-empirical methods become restrictive when many molecules must be evaluated. Here we report the first hardware-native realisation of semi-empirical electronic structure theory on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), implementing as a proof of principle Extended Hückel Theory (EHT) and non-self-consistent Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB0). Our design performs Hamiltonian construction and diagonalisation on the FPGA device through a streaming dataflow, enabling deterministic execution without host intervention. On a mid-range Artix-7 FPGA, the DFTB0 Hamiltonian generator delivers a throughput over fourfold higher than that of a contemporary server-class CPU. Improvements in eigensolver design, memory capacity, and extensions to nuclear gradients and excited states could further expand capability. Combined with the inherent energy efficiency of FPGA dataflow, this work opens a pathway towards sustainable, hardware-native acceleration of electronic-structure simulation and direct hardware implementations of a broad class of methods.

*Venkat Kapil*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Regularized End-point Gradient (REG) TI is introduced to address the numerical challenges in free energy calculations for solids with diffusive degrees of freedom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Free energy calculations are essential in understanding the thermodynamics of solids, but standard methods like harmonic-to-anharmonic thermodynamic integration (TI) often face numerical challenges due to near-singularities in the integrand.

Method: The REG TI method removes the singularity in the integrand by regularizing the end-point gradient, allowing for accurate evaluation on a uniform grid.

Result: REG TI outperforms standard TI, enabling more reliable and efficient calculations for systems with diffusive degrees of freedom, such as quasi-free methyl rotations in paracetamol polymorphs.

Conclusion: This advancement simplifies anharmonic free energy calculations and could pave the way for automated thermodynamic analysis of complex solid systems.

Abstract: Standard harmonic-to-anharmonic thermodynamic integration (TI) is known to develop a near singularity in the integrand for solids exhibiting diffusive degrees of freedom, such as rotating functional groups or migrating defects. This pathology results in numerical challenges for estimating absolute free energies within a single thermodynamic cycle. In this work, we introduce a simple regularization that removes this singularity and yields a well-behaved integrand that can be accurately evaluated on a uniform grid. The approach -- termed Regularized End-point Gradient (REG) TI -- is demonstrated on a model system and on predicting the relative stability of paracetamol polymorphs for which quasi-free methyl rotations lead to a near singularity in standard TI. We expect REG TI to simplify anharmonic free energy calculations for solids and to potentially enable their automation.

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: Noise suppression techniques are used in beam loss detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beam loss signals are crucial for monitoring machine performance, and noise interference makes accurate detection challenging.

Method: Advanced digital filters are employed to suppress noise, including multi-stage filters optimized for real-time processing.

Result: The integrated approach showed good performance in noise suppression and baseline tracking.

Conclusion: Implementation of combined filtering and baseline correction methods improves data quality for beam loss monitoring.

Abstract: In Fermilab's PIP-II machine protection system, beam loss signals from various detectors are digitized at 125 MS/s. Noise from both high-frequency sources and low-frequency 60 Hz AC power equipment can contaminate the data. To suppress noise across these ranges especially 60 Hz and its harmonics, which overlap with beam loss signal frequencies advanced digital processing beyond standard filtering is required. Several real-time functional blocks were simulated and tested on an FPGA: (1) a dual time-constant discharging integrator filter, (2) a de-ripple baseline extraction and storage block, and (3) a fast-recovery discharging integrator. The nonlinear IIR integrator filter removes high-frequency noise and feeds into the baseline extractor. Upon detecting abrupt beam loss, it switches to a longer time constant to prevent baseline distortion. The de-ripple block calculates a valid baseline by averaging over multiple 60 Hz periods, storing results in a 4096-word FPGA RAM. This baseline is subtracted from raw data before integration by the fast-recovery block, which resets quickly after use. All blocks achieved expected performance.

Abstract: Intrabeam scattering refers to the effects of the Coulomb interaction acting between pairs of charged particles within a bunch in an accelerator. One of the main consequences of intrabeam scattering is a change in the emittances of a bunch: in some circumstances (in particular, in hadron storage rings operating above transition), the transverse and longitudinal emittances may grow over time without limit. This may restrict the performance of machines for which maintaining low beam emittance is an important requirement. In this note, we describe some of the models used to analyse the effects of intrabeam scattering, and present in particular the Piwinski formulae for the emittance growth rates. We compare the predicted changes in emittance with measurements in a number of machines operating in different parameter regimes.

Abstract: Understanding and controlling phase transitions is a fundamental part of physics and has been central to many technological revolutions, from steam engines to field-effect transistors. At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes.

Abstract: Blinking and multiphoton emission in metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) limit their use as single-photon quantum emitters. Conventional models distinguish between trion-related A-type blinking and defect-assisted BC-type blinking, both expected to degrade single-photon purity in a dark state. Here, time-resolved spectroscopy on individual PQDs reveals a qualitatively different regime in which low emitting dark states exhibit higher single-photon purity than bright states. For those PQDs state-resolved $g^{(2)}(τ)$ analysis shows that the exciton photoluminescence quantum yield decreases by a factor of $\sim 8$, while the biexciton one is suppressed by a factor of $\sim 10$. This leads to a moderate improvement of single-photon purity with $g^{(2)}_0$ decreased from 0.155 to 0.120. In contrast, PQDs with fluorescence lifetime--intensity distribution patterns characteristic for A-type blinking, display the expected increase of $g^{(2)}_0$ in charged, trion-dominated states. To explain the observed improvement of single-photon purity of low-emitting dark states, we propose a self-trapped-exciton (STE) mechanism that selectively blocks biexciton formation by diverting hot excitons into long-lived, weakly emissive STE configurations. This STE-mediated blinking channel explains why certain low-emitting states improve, rather than degrade, single-photon purity and suggests a lattice-driven route to perovskite quantum emitters with intrinsically suppressed multiphoton events.

Abstract: We investigate the properties of trions in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) monolayers using the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM) adapted to two-dimensional systems. Excitons and trions in monolayer TMDCs with the chemical composition MX$_2$ in the 2H phase are studied systematically. We computed the associated exciton and trion binding energies. We find in addition to the known $J = 0$ trion the existence of a bound state with orbital angular momentum $J = 1$. The results for $J = 0$ are benchmarked against existing calculations from the Stochastic Variational Method (SVM) and Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Furthermore, we analyze the trion internal structure and geometry through their probability density distributions, accounting for the effects of different material shows that GEM -- widely used in studies of strongly interacting few-body systems -- is well adapted to allow comprehensive and computationally efficient investigations of trions and potentially other weakly bound few-body states in layered materials. In addition, we systematically exploit the effect of strain and dieletric environment in the $J = 1$ trion predictions, illustrated for the MoS$_2$ monolayer example.

### [67] [Optical gain in colloidal quantum dots is limited by biexciton absorption, not biexciton recombination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11428)
*Davide Zenatti,Patanjali Kambhampati*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A microscopic theory of optical gain in colloidal quantum dots is developed, explaining gain thresholds, size dependence, and small cross sections through a balance of stimulated emission and absorption involving single excitons and biexcitons, without relying on long-lived biexcitons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the microscopic mechanisms behind optical gain in colloidal quantum dots is crucial for advancing their applications in lighting and optoelectronics.

Method: The theory uses a spin-boson model with excitons coupled to a lattice bath, analyzing the interplay between biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice interactions.

Result: The theory successfully explains existing experimental observations and predicts a continuous transition to near-thresholdless gain in disordered materials.

Conclusion: This theory unifies previous models and provides a new framework for understanding and designing quantum dots with enhanced optical properties.

Abstract: Despite three decades of experimental study, optical gain in colloidal quantum dots still lacks a microscopic theory capable of explaining gain thresholds approaching one exciton per dot, their size dependence, or the anomalously small effective stimulated-emission cross sections observed across materials. Existing descriptions treat quantum dots as effective two-level systems comprised of an exciton and a biexciton, attributing gain thresholds to biexciton Auger recombination. This assumption is inconsistent with state-resolved optical pumping experiments and basic spectroscopic constraints. Here we present a microscopic theory of optical gain explicitly anchored in the Einstein relations governing absorption and stimulated emission. Within this framework, gain is determined by a spectral balance between stimulated emission from single excitons and excited-state absorption into biexcitonic manifolds, rather than by biexciton lifetimes. Using a spin-boson description of excitons coupled to a lattice bath, we show that gain thresholds and effective gain cross sections are controlled by the interplay of biexciton stabilization and exciton-lattice dressing. The theory unifies disparate materials by quantitatively explaining all longstanding gain phenomenology in CdSe quantum dots and predicts a continuous crossover to effective four-level, near-thresholdless gain in dynamically disordered lattices such as perovskite quantum dots.

Abstract: Thermodynamics coupled with quantum features on electron and hole dynamics in Dirac materials is quite interesting and crucial for real device applications. The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence. This study reveals information about the interaction potential-DOS relationship in the Dirac materials.

Abstract: Using mean-field theory, we determine the electronic phase diagram of undoped AB-stacked bilayer graphene in the presence of a transverse electric field. In addition to multiple competing electronic instabilities characterized by excitonic order parameters, our framework incorporates the long-range Coulomb energy associated with interlayer polarization. This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers. Field-driven transitions are accompanied by discontinuous and non-monotonic variations of the single-electron gap. We relate our results to Hartree-Fock numerical calculations and to experimental research, including observations of fractional metallic phases that emerge upon doping the bilayer system.

Abstract: Topological wave phenomena in continuous media are fundamentally challenged by unbounded spectra and the absence of a compact Brillouin zone, which obstruct conventional bulk--interface formulations. We develop a unified phase-space framework for screened magnetized plasma based on a pseudo-Hermitian formulation with a positive-definite metric, enabling a generalized Schrödinger description and a Weyl-symbol analysis of the bulk generator. We show that the bulk symbol hosts isolated band degeneracies acting as Berry--Chern monopoles, including a higher-order spin-1 degeneracy with topological charge $+2$ that generically splits into two spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Weyl points under symmetry breaking. To characterize topology in this noncompact setting, we introduce a strip-gap Chern number associated with finite real-frequency strips of the bulk spectrum, extending band Chern topology to continuum systems. This invariant governs the spectral flow of interface modes induced by spatial variations of the magnetic field and establishes a bulk--interface correspondence at the level of phase-space symbols. By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge. We further show that this correspondence persists under collisional damping, provided that a finite strip gap remains and no exceptional points enter it. Our results provide a systematic phase-space framework for topological wave transport in continuous media beyond compact-band and idealized Hermitian settings.

Abstract: We investigate the charge and spin transport in a non-Hermitian ring of electrons subject to an external Zeeman field. By introducing non-Hermiticity through anti-Hermitian hopping in the nearest neighbour bonds, we demonstrate that anti-Hermiticity, along with the applied Zeeman field significantly modify the energy spectrum and strongly influence transport properties. As a result, we obtain that when antiferromagnetic Zeeman field is considered, a finite charge current emerges in both the real and imaginary parts of the current, which are in contrast to the ferromagnetic case where only the imaginary current exist. On the other hand, in both cases, the spin current vanishes. Interestingly, we reveal an emergence and strong enhancement of spin currents under balanced spin population upon introducing quasiperiodicity in the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering. At the same time, the charge current also exhibits substantial enhancement due to quasiperiodic modulation. These results highlight non-Hermitian quantum rings as versatile platforms for unconventional spin-charge transport.

Abstract: The integration of topological insulators (TIs) with graphene offers a pathway to engineer hybrid quantum states, yet the impact of strain at the 2D limit remains a critical open question. Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moiré ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit.

Abstract: A two-dimensional crystal melts via the proliferation and unbinding of topological defects, yet quantitatively predicting the melting temperature $T_m$ in real systems is challenging. Here we resolve this discrepancy in quantum Hall electron bubble phases by combining Corbino-geometry transport experiment in an ultraclean GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well for Landau levels 2 to 5 with Hartree--Fock elasticity and the full Kosterlitz--Thouless--Halperin--Nelson--Young melting criterion including the finite-temperature renormalization-group calculation. The theoretically obtained $T_m$ quantitatively captures the measured solid-liquid phase transition boundaries across all probed ranges, validating the bubble-crystal interpretation and establishing defect--mediated melting as a predictive framework for strongly interacting electronic solids. This agreement further supports using bulk transport to probe the energetics of topological defects and screening in quantum Hall physics, and the approach is readily extendable to other electronic crystals, including the generalized Wigner crystal in moiré Chern bands.

Abstract: Coherent control of two-level quantum systems is typically achieved using resonant driving fields, forming the basis for qubit operations. Here, we report a mechanism for inducing complete Rabi oscillations in monochromatically driven two-level quantum systems, when the drive frequency is much larger than the Larmor frequency of the qubit. This effect$\unicode{x2015}$Rabi oscillations induced by nonresonant geometric drive (RING)$\unicode{x2015}$requires that the control field is elliptical, enclosing a nonzero area per cycle. We illustrate the effect with numerical simulations, and provide an analytical understanding via a simple effective Hamiltonian obtained from Floquet theory and perturbation theory. We show that RING enables coherent oscillations without relying on resonant energy exchange, allows for high-pass noise filtering, provides access to non-Abelian phases in finite magnetic fields. We detail a realization in electrically driven spin-orbit qubits and argue that the RING mechanism enables amplification of the Rabi frequency using the same gate voltage amplitudes at higher drive frequencies. Our results broaden the landscape of quantum control techniques, by highlighting a pathway to achieving coherent oscillations under off-resonant driving conditions.

Abstract: We study the non-Hermitian topology of multi-terminal transport in a quantum spin-Hall device described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry alone does not imply non-reciprocal transport or a non-Hermitian conductance matrix. Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators coupled to solid-state qubits offer a scalable architecture for long-range entangling operations and fast, high-fidelity readout. Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable. We also map out the respective charge-photon couplings and photon-loss rates required. Furthermore, we show that experimental constraints on charge-photon coupling and photon loss can be mitigated using squeezed input fields. As similar trade-offs appear in quantum-dot-based qubits, our methods and insights extend naturally to these platforms, offering a potential route toward scalable architectures.

TL;DR: 我们得到了一个$(3+1)$维黑洞弦和btz黑洞在dekel-zhao暗物质镜面配置下的解析解。暗物质环境诱导了里奇和凯氏标量的奇点，但没有在真空btz情况下出现。我们evaluate了应力能量张量的有效分量，发现null, weak, 和strong energy conditions都被严格满足，但dominant energy条件在btz情形下被违反，由于高的切向压力梯度。暗物质调整了 Hawking 温度和自由能，没有破坏局域或全局稳定性。暗物质分布使原本常曲率的btz时空变成了奇异的时空，暗物质分布的固有刚性是这些解因果结构的决定因素。

Conclusion: 暗物质对$(3+1)$维黑洞弦和btz黑洞的演化有重要影响，特别是在奇点形成和能量条件满足方面。此研究为暗物质对 black hole 的影响提供了一个理论框架。

Abstract: In this work, we obtain analytical solutions for a $(3+1)$-dimensional black string and a BTZ black hole, both sourced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter (DM) density profile. Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions.

Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically extremal black holes through the nonlinear evolution of a charged scalar field. Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with "hair"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity.

Abstract: The novel proposal to invoke the split of the Ricci scalar into bulk and boundary terms in the gravitational action, opens up a new avenue of investigation into stellar dynamics. The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves.

Abstract: The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.

Abstract: We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) as a diagnostic tool for probing frame-dragging effects and accretion disk physics in the spacetime of a rotating regular magnetic black hole (BH). Specifically, we analyze the precession of bound orbits and the epicyclic oscillations of test particles under small perturbations in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate how the BH nonminimal coupling parameter (lambda/M^4) and dimensionless magnetic charge (Q/M) significantly influence the three fundamental epicyclic frequencies. By applying the relativistic precession model and employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC), we constrain the BH characteristic parameters, including mass, spin, magnetic charge, and nonminimal coupling, using observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries: GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, and GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, we examine the Lense-Thirring, geodetic, and general spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer around the black hole. Our theoretical results indicate that the regular charged black hole suppresses these precession frequencies compared with the Kerr black hole case.

Abstract: Gravitational effects associated with black holes are widely believed to universally degrade quantum entanglement, with the loss of maximal entanglement being particularly severe and even irreversible for bosonic fields. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols.

Abstract: In context of Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theories of gravity, it has recently been obtained that the post-Newtonian parameters should be generalized in the context of strongly gravitating bodies, and that its generalization -- the so-called $\textit{exact parameters}$ -- actually depends on the pressure and energy density of a considered celestial body. Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Farèse non-pertubative parameter $α_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\mathcal{L}_m=-ρ$, where $ρ$ is the total energy density. If $\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.

Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant framework for holonomy effects in models of loop quantum gravity with consistent black hole solutions coupled to a scalar field. Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws.

Abstract: We revisit the notion of massive particle hypersurfaces and place it within a unified framework alongside photon hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes. More precisely, for Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces $T=\mathbb{R}\times S_0$, where $S_0$ is a smooth embedded surface in a spacelike slice $S$ of the stationary spacetime, we show that $T$ is a photon hypersurface or a massive particle hypersurface if and only if $S_0$ is totally geodesic with respect to certain associated Finsler structures on the slice: a Randers metric governing null geodesics and a Jacobi--Randers metric governing timelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation at fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio. We also prove existence and multiplicity results for proper-time parametrized solutions of the Lorentz force equation with fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio, either connecting a point to a flow line of the Killing vector field or having periodic, non-constant projection on $S$.

Abstract: The relation between spin and statistics in quantum field theory relies on Poincaré invariance, a symmetry that is lost in the presence of a gravitational field, and replaced in general relativity by the principle of general covariance. In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics.

TL;DR: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors will enable milli-Hertz gravitational wave astronomy.

The tool uses high-performance parallel programming and automatic differentiation for efficient computation. It also presents an optimized waveform model integration. Bayesian parameter estimation with higher modes shows improved source property measurements. Automatic differentiation provides accurate Fisher matrices without manual tuning.

Motivation: Gravitational wave astronomy is expanding into the milli-Hertz band, which requires advanced data analysis tools. Efficient parameter estimation is crucial for detecting and understanding massive black hole binaries.

Method: The paper utilizes the high-performance parallel programming framework Taichi-Lang to handle core computations. Automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration are employed for waveform modeling and Bayesian parameter estimation.

Result: Higher modes are essential for breaking parameter degeneracies. Coincident observations improve source property measurements. Automatic differentiation enhances Fisher matrix accuracy, and approximated posteriors validate the Bayesian method.

Conclusion: PBAT (pespace) is a powerful tool for massive black hole binary parameter estimation. Its efficient computation and integration of waveform models advance milli-Hertz gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors will expand the scope of gravitational wave astronomy to the milli-Hertz band in the near future. The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \texttt{PhenomXAS} and \texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate different treatments of dark matter (DM) distributions surrounding extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to assess their impact on orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission. Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe and may have an enhanced abundance in bouncing cosmologies, where a long contracting phase can amplify perturbations. We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.

Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.

### [91] [Black Holes Trapped by Ghosts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12101)
*Cheng-Yong Zhang,Yunqi Liu,Bin Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Newton's law fails in non-linear scenarios. This paper points out that before the linear phase predicted by gravitational wave models, there's a nonlinear bottleneck phase that could cause significant delays in black hole or neutron star mergers. The nonlinear effect is related to a universal property of bifurcation in physics and can cause a 'quiescence-burst' pattern in gravitational waves, which might be detectable by future instruments like LIGO or Neutron Star Delay Observables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detection. Understanding the dynamics of black hole and neutron star mergers has been a key focus of gravitational wave physics. Recent work has predicted a linear phase where gravitational waves can be modeled with simple theory, but this paper suggests there's a more complex, nonlinear phase that could affect observations and our understanding of these cosmic events.

Method: Mathematical analysis and numerical simulations. The authors likely used a combination of analytical methods and computer simulations to model the behavior of black hole remnants and gravitational waves in both linear and nonlinear regimes.

Result: The discovery of a nonlinear bottleneck phase in black hole remnants could have significant implications for gravitational wave physics. This was characterized by a 'silen为c-burst' pattern in gravitational wave emissions, with a prolonged period of silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown phase. The mechanism involves a saddle-node bifurcation in phase space, which was identified as a universal property of certain nonlinear systems in nature.

Conclusion: This work challenges the traditional view of black hole mergers and opens up new areas of research in gravitational wave physics. The identification of a universal nonlinear phenomenon could lead to new predictions and potentially new phenomena observes with future gravitational wave detectors like LIGO.

Abstract: Violent cosmic events, from black hole mergers to stellar collapses, often leave behind highly excited black hole remnants that inevitably relax to equilibrium. The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.

Abstract: Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.

Abstract: Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.

Abstract: Volumetric lithography offers a path to scalable fabrication of complex three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanoscale architectures, yet existing approaches are limited by quasi-two-dimensional exposure physics or slow serial writing. We present a single-exposure volumetric fabrication strategy that enables creation of ultrahigh-aspect-ratio 3D structures with 6 um minimum features. An inverse-designed volumetric (holographic) phase mask generates an extended-depth-of-field intensity distribution inside a photoresist volume while preserving high transverse resolution, enabling uniform polymerization of the full volume in a single exposure. With exposure times of approximately 20 s, we fabricate lattices, Penrose tilings, and micromechanical elements with feature sizes down to 6 um over volumes up to 800 x 800 x 720 um^3, achieving aspect ratios exceeding 120:1. Quantitative analysis of capillary flow in hollow lattices demonstrates controlled fluid transport with an effective capillary transport coefficient of 176.3 um/(ms)^(1/2). In situ nanoindentation-based micro-compression reveals that the printed 3D hexagonal close-packed lattices exhibit a well-defined linear elastic regime with an effective Young's modulus of 5.7 GPa, followed by progressive buckling and densification characteristic of mechanically robust cellular architectures. Overlapping, tilted and multi-mask exposures further enable quasi-3D complex geometries with potential for reconfigurability. This approach establishes a new regime of high-throughput volumetric fabrication.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a switchable high-Q light absorber based on a reconfigurable metasurface enabled by a lowloss phase-change material (PCM). By leveraging the coupling between guided-mode resonance and Fabry-Perot modes, mediated by the phase-transition dynamics of the embedded PCM, the resonance Q factor can be actively tuned. This allows the system to switch from a perfect dark state, governed by the physics of bound states in the continuum, to a critically coupled resonance with a finite Q factor. Consequently, the metasurface exhibits perfect absorption in the amorphous state and a reflection-dominated response in the crystalline state. The proposed metasurface holds significant potential for diverse nanophotonic applications, including photodetection and thermal emission control.

Abstract: Dispersion-based photonics-assisted microwave measurement systems provide immense potential for real-time analysis of wideband and dynamic signals. However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective.

Abstract: Supercontinuum generation (SCG) on integrated photonic platforms is a pivotal technology for developing next-generation chip-scale systems for precision spectroscopy and metrology. While significant progress has been made with silicon (Si) and silicon nitride ($Si_3N_4$) platforms, they are often constrained by two-photon absorption (TPA) or moderate nonlinear coefficients, necessitating a trade-off between energy efficiency and bandwidth. Tantalum pentoxide ($Ta_2O_5$), possessing both high nonlinearity and a wide bandgap, emerges as a promising candidate; however, current implementations remain challenged by high pump energy consumption. Here, we report a low-loss $Ta_2O_5$ integrated waveguide fabricated via the Damascene process. It enables the generation of a two-octave-spanning spectrum with a low pulse energy of only 92.9 pJ (60 fs, 1550 nm). Notably, the corresponding peak power is a mere 1.36 kW, which is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art comparable broadband sources. Furthermore, at the maximum pump energy, our spectrum exhibits an ultrabroad coverage from 450 nm to 3400 nm, spanning nearly three octaves. Supported by numerical simulations, we analyze the dynamics of soliton fission. Furthermore, a Michelson interferometry system developed using this source exhibits superior performance, achieving not only micrometer-scale axial resolution but also a 6 dB sensitivity roll-off length of 3.1 mm. This exceptional roll-off performance, combined with a displacement measurement sensitivity of 346 nm, underscores the immense potential of the $Ta_2O_5$ platform for applications in biomedical imaging and precision metrology.

Abstract: Coupled resonators form band-like optical states that support rich nonlinearities beyond what is possible in single resonators. In these systems, four-wave mixing mediates interband coupling, displaying multimode dynamics that span both spatial and spectral degrees of freedom. In this study, we propose a framework describing the onset and control of hybridized optical parametric oscillation in three coupled silicon nitride microring resonators. In a symmetric configuration, we observe the emergence of diverse phase-matching pathways defined by the dispersive band structure. We develop an analytical model that captures the parametric gain of these interband processes and derive closed-form expressions for the dominant gain maxima; the analytical framework itself readily extends to more complex coupled networks. We further report an asymmetric design that co-engineers mode overlap and dispersion to operate on a compact 7-GHz spacing, free from mode competition. Our findings establish design principles for engineering nonlinear dynamics in coupled-resonator platforms, with implications for coherent photonic computing and quantum information processing.

Abstract: Photon pairs play a vital role in modern science, driving extensive research into their generation. Yet, the narrow phase-matching bandwidth of conventional crystals has largely confined studies to specific wavelengths, leaving research on broadband tunable sources underexplored. Here, we employ a non-critical phase-matched lithium niobate (LN) crystal to generate widely tunable photon pairs. The generated near-infrared (NIR) photon pairs exhibit a high coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR > 20 dB) and are tunable across the 800-1600 nm range. We further showcase the utility of NIR photon pairs in spectroscopy by detecting carbon monoxide (CO) gas absorption. This approach will facilitate the design of advanced LN-based photonic experiments.

Abstract: This work focuses on optical tunneling across thin three-layer planar structures embedded in a thick and transparent dielectric medium. First, compact transmittance expressions for different configurations are obtained using a generalized Fresnel coefficient method. These expressions are subsequently used to analyze various tunnelling outcomes. We show that two types of tunneling effects can be distinguished, depending on the kind of waves that are present in the core layer. When harmonic waves propagate in this layer, the transmittance formula and the phase condition for resonant tunneling are identical to that obtained in a Fabry-Perot etalon. However, in the case of evanescent or damped waves in the core layer, the new expression for transmittance provides another resonant condition related, this time, to the wave amplitude. For clarity, transparent materials are addressed first (including ideal metals), and the implications of absorption are studied later. Different angular-spectral maps are displayed to exemplify the main features of the tunneling effect in each analyzed configuration. To highlight, it is shown that tunnelling can occur in photonic systems with thicknesses up to several wavelengths.

Abstract: Controlling how an open photonic system exchanges energy with its environment-and in particular how it radiates into the far field-is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian wave physics and a key enabler for directional photonic functionalities. Here, we propose a new route to robust unidirectional emission based on the non-Hermitian hybridization of resonances localized in spatially separated layers of a hetero-bilayer photonic crystal. By tailoring the interlayer coupling, we engineer hybrid photonc bands that exhibit strong unidirectional radiation across a broad spectral and momentum range while maintaining theoretically high quality factors. This asymmetric emission is organized by a topological vortex in a pseudo-polarization field defined from the front/back intensity imbalance, which endows the directionality with robustness against perturbations. We further show that, by tuning the surrounding refractive index, this singularity can be displaced in parameter space, enabling reversible switching of the emission direction and a reconfigurable far-field response. This framework opens perspectives for topological photonic sensing and for directional and switchable light sources, including unidirectional lasing supported by high-quality-factor modes.

Abstract: In two-photon polymerization (TPP), the degree of conversion (DC) of the resin has an effect on a broad range of material properties like refractive index (RI) or stiffness. Heterogeneous DC can substitute material doping and multimaterial structures, and outright enable structure designs not possible otherwise. However, obtaining variable DC in the polymer, typically achieved by implementing a variable exposure dose, is held back due to the lack of software support for fabrication and measurement techniques for validation, adding up to a high barrier of entry.
  This work presents two major breakthroughs in (3+1)D TPP: design freedom and variable-DC fabrication, that are provided by an open-source slicer, as well as calibration methodology for determination of the RI for any DC. Application examples include grayscale lithography, control over writing direction and trajectories, as well as bio-mimicking microphantoms with carefully engineered 3D RI. Results of the RI calibration demonstrate excellent repeatability, accuracy and stability of variable-DC structures. Supported by in-depth metrological analysis, the goal is to popularize variable DC printing within TPP community and to get more out of the existing TPP systems and workflows. In summary, this work provides a complete toolbox for 3D RI engineering and sets the stage for new inventions enabled by point-wise dose control.

Abstract: Coherent perfect tunneling in the presence of loss and asymmetry remains a fundamental challenge in wave transport, a universal problem across optics, acoustics, and quantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate coherent perfect tunneling at an exceptional point in a passive one-dimensional waveguide cascade with three coupled interfaces. Using a waveguide-invariant scattering framework, we show that the suppression of a selected output channel originates from a directional scattering degeneracy rather than from resonance or absorption collapse. This exceptional-point condition emerges when interference between boundary-induced feedback loops promotes a simple zero of the scattering response to a second-order degeneracy. As a direct consequence, fixed coherent excitation produces a robust quartic leakage law within a transparency-dominated tunneling window. These results establish directional degeneracy as a general mechanism for loss-tolerant tunneling enabled by exceptional points across a broad class of wave systems.

Abstract: In the present paper, we construct a theoretical description of a three-dimensional photonic topological insulator in the form of a simple cubic lattice of bianisotropic resonators that is based on a dyadic Green's function approach. By considering electric and magnetic dipole modes and the interactions between different numbers of the nearest resonators, we obtain the Bloch Hamiltonians and the corresponding tight-binding models and analyze the band diagrams, spatial structure of the eigenmodes, and their localization, revealing quadratic degeneracies in the vicinity of high-symmetry points in the absence of bianisotropy and the emergence of in-gap states localized at a domain wall upon the introduction of bianisotropy. Finally, we visualize the Berry curvature distributions to study the topological properties of the considered models.

Abstract: Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) phase retrieval becomes rapidly difficult in the strong-phase regime, where a crystal contains distortions beyond half a lattice spacing. An important special case is the phase domain problem, where blocks of a crystal are displaced with sharp jumps at domain walls. The strong-phase, here defined as beyond $\pm π/2$, generates split Bragg peaks and dense fringe structure for which classical iterative solvers often stagnate or return different solutions from different initialisations. Here, we introduce an unsupervised Fourier Vision Transformer (Fourier ViT) to solve this block-phase, multi-domain phase-retrieval problem directly from measured 2D Bragg diffraction intensities. Fourier ViT couples reciprocal-space information globally through multiscale Fourier token mixing, while shallow convolutional front and back-ends provide local filtering and reconstruction. We validate the approach on large-scale synthetic datasets of Voronoi multi-domain crystals with strong-phase contrast under realistic noise corruptions, and on experimental diffraction from a $\mathrm{La}_{2-x}\mathrm{Ca}_x\mathrm{MnO}_4$ nanocrystal. Across the regimes considered, Fourier ViT achieves the lowest reciprocal-space mismatch ($χ^2$) among the compared methods and preserves domain-resolved phase reconstructions for increasing numbers of domains. On experimental data, with the same real-space support, Fourier ViT matches the iterative benchmark $χ^2$ while improving robustness to random initialisations, yielding a higher success rate of low-$χ^2$ reconstructions than the complex convolutional neural network baseline.

Abstract: The infra-red behaviour of gauge theories coupled to matter remains an open problem in quantum field theory. For a given gauge group, such theories are expected to flow to an interacting conformal fixed point over a range of fermion or scalar flavours, known as the `conformal window.' Their nature is important for understanding critical phases and phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm like the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), yet remains challenging for conventional non-perturbative approaches. In this work, we study a family of fuzzy-sphere models corresponding to non-linear sigma models with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry extended to the strongly-coupled region. These theories are expected have an infra-red fixed point described by $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in three space-time dimensions with $N$ flavours of fermions. They can be viewed as a generalisation of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ DQCP, corresponding to $N=2$. We investigate them using quantum Monte Carlo for $N$ up to $16$. We find evidence that for $N\geq4$ the phase diagram contains a critical phase that appears to be absent for $N=2$. Within this phase, we measure the two-point correlation function and the excitation spectrum, which exhibit emergent conformal symmetry. We also extract the scaling dimension $Δ_φ$ of a leading operator and find consistency with large-$N$ expectations.

### [107] [Kosmann derivative and momentum maps from a duality covariant framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11267)
*Romina Ballesteros,Eric Lescano,Jesús A. Rodríguez*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR:  paper discusses covariant implementation of diffeomorphisms in gravitational theories using a concept called generalized Kosmann derivative in Double Field Theory. The authors introduce a compensating term acting as a generalized momentum map to make the derivative fully covariant, enabling a consistent definition of generalized diffeomorphisms. The results are applied to heterotic supergravity, providing momentum maps for symmetry transformations, which have implications for understanding conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry, particularly for black hole thermodynamics with higher-derivative corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  understanding covariant aspects of gravitational theories and their symmetries is crucial for developing consistent theories, especially in the context of string theory and gravity dualities like Double Field Theory. this paper addresses how generalized diffeomorphisms can be implemented covariantly, which is important for maintaining consistency and covariance in the theory. the introduction of a momentum map and the resulting symmetry transformations opens new avenues for exploring black hole thermodynamics and related areas.

Method: the paper uses a rigorous mathematical framework combining concepts from differential geometry, particularly diffeomorphisms and symmetries, with the specific formalism of Double Field Theory and generalized geometry. The authors derive the generalized Kosmann derivative by extending the standard Lie derivative to incorporate additional fluxes and compensating terms. They then analyze the algebra of these generalized diffeomorphisms and their implications for the supergravity field content.

Result:  the authors successfully construct a fully covariant generalized Kosmann derivative using a compensating term in the context of heterotic supergravity. This operator defines a consistent realization of generalized diffeomorphisms, enabling the identification of momentum maps at the supergravity level. These momentum maps provide a duality-covariant interpretation of the symmetries, facilitating the construction of conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry. The results have direct implications for black hole thermodynamics, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic properties of black holes in theories with internal symmetries and higher-derivative corrections.

Conclusion: this paper makes a significant contribution to the understanding of covariant implementations of generalized diffeomorphisms in the context of Double Field Theory. The introduction of a generalized momentum map and the resulting symmetry transformations offers a promising step towards a fully consistent and covariant framework for studying conserved quantities and symmetries in doubled geometry, with clear practical applications in black hole thermodynamics and related areas of gravitational research.

Abstract: A covariant implementation of diffeomorphisms in the presence of local symmetries is a nontrivial aspect of gravitational theories. In Double Field Theory, this is achieved through the so-called generalized Kosmann derivative. In this work, we show that the generalized Kosmann derivative admits a natural formulation entirely in terms of generalized fluxes through the inclusion of a compensating term that plays the role of a generalized momentum map, yielding a fully determined and covariant operator that provides a covariant realization of generalized diffeomorphisms. When parameterized in terms of the field content of heterotic supergravity, the resulting symmetry transformations give rise to momentum maps at the supergravity level, offering a duality-covariant interpretation of these objects. This framework provides a natural setting for the construction of conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry with internal symmetries, with direct implications for black hole thermodynamics and its higher-derivative corrections in a duality-covariant setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding lower-dimensional integrable field theories and their connections to higher-dimensional gauge theories is a key motivation in theoretical physics.

Method: Starting with a 6d theory on twistor space, the authors reduce dimensions by imposing symmetry constraints, leading to a 4d integrable field theory.

Result: The derived 4d theory exhibits semi-local symmetries and is linked to the Yang-Baxter sigma model, with implications for anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations.

Conclusion: This work bridges six-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with four-dimensional integrable models, advancing our understanding of connections between gauge theories and sigma models.

Abstract: We derive a novel two-field four-dimensional integrable field theory (IFT) from 6d holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space. The four-dimensional IFT depends on a skew-symmetric linear operator acting on a Lie algebra, and when this operator is specialised to a solution of the modified classical Yang-Baxter equation, the IFT develops a semi-local symmetry associated with this solution. The resulting 4d analogue of the Yang-Baxter sigma model is related by symmetry reduction to the well-known 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model. An important implication that we find is the embedding of the equations of motion of the 2d Yang-Baxter sigma model in the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The 6d Chern-Simons theory on twistor space can alternatively be symmetry reduced to a 4d Chern-Simons theory configuration with disorder surface defects. The latter realises the Yang-Baxter sigma model, implying a "diamond" for the Yang-Baxter sigma model obtained from twistor space.

Motivation: Investigating thermodynamic aspects of black holes in different geometric setups to understand phase transitions and critical phenomena.

Method: Mathematical analysis of black hole solutions in AdS spacetime, derivation of thermodynamic quantities like pressure, volume, and temperature.

Result: The Hayward-AdS black hole exhibits Van der Waals-type P-V criticality, distinct from singular counterparts; Thermodynamic topology analysis reveals a change in topological charges indicating a qualitative shift in phase space structure.

Conclusion: The study contributes to understanding how additional geometric constraints affect black hole thermodynamics, particularly in AdS contexts.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the Hayward-AdS black hole and compare it with its singular counterpart from which it can be constructed through the imposition of an additional constraint. The singular black hole displays a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions reminiscent of those observed in higher-dimensional Kerr-AdS spacetimes. After the constraint is imposed, the resulting Hayward-AdS black hole continues to exhibit Van der Waals-type $P-V$ criticality. However, its Gibbs free energy profile differs qualitatively from that of standard RN-AdS black holes. In addition, we extend the analysis by employing thermodynamic topology to characterize the global structure of the phase space. We find that the topological charge of the singular black hole is $-1$, whereas that of the Hayward-AdS black hole becomes $+1$. This change of topological charge indicates that the constraint not only regularizes the geometry but also induces a qualitative transformation in the thermodynamic configuration space.

Conclusion: 该研究为Krylov空间的操作符生长提供了一个完整的AdS对偶描述，并确认了AdS稳定性在量子动力学中的基础作用。

Abstract: We establish a holographic gravitational dual for the fundamental dynamical equations governing operator growth in Krylov subspace. Specifically, we show that the deep interior of the Krylov subspace maps directly to the near-horizon regime of AdS$_2$ gravity. We demonstrate that, in the continuum limit, the discrete evolution on the Krylov chain transforms into the dynamics of a continuous field, which is isomorphic to the Klein-Gordon equation for a scalar field in the AdS$_2$ throat. This correspondence identifies the linear growth rate of Lanczos coefficients with the Hawking temperature, $α=πT$, thereby recovering the saturation of the maximal chaos bound. Notably, the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, a fundamental stability criterion in AdS gravity, emerges as a necessary consistency requirement for the dual description of Krylov subspace dynamics. Our results advance a Krylov-based holographic dictionary in a unified $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ representation, revealing that the emergent geometry of Krylov subspace is a reflection of the near-horizon AdS spacetime.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this essay and utilizing the holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flow, we demonstrate how the effective action of a non-gravitating quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) develops an Einstein-Hilbert term in the infrared (IR). That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.

Abstract: Following the previously developed approach to the calculation of quantum corrections to the effective potential in arbitrary scalar field theories in the leading logarithmic approximation, we extended it to the next-to-leading order. Based on Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization procedure and the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk theorem, we construct recurrence relations and renormalization group equations that allow one to sum up the leading and subleading logarithms in all orders of perturbation theory. The formalism is applicable to an arbitrary scalar potential, renormalizable or not. To verify the results, we compare them with a renormalizable model treated within the standard renormalization group approach.

Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.

Abstract: Holographic entanglement entropy is a key concept linking quantum information theory and gravity. Since the original conjecture of Ryu and Takayanagi, holographic entanglement entropy has been generalized beyond Einstein--Hilbert gravity to include higher-curvature corrections. In most existing generalizations, however, it is implicitly assumed that the bulk spacetime geometry is Riemannian, i.e. torsion-free. Here we propose a prescription for incorporating torsion into holographic entanglement entropy in the boundary theory dual to five-dimensional Chern--Simons gravity. We argue that the entanglement entropy acquires an additional universal divergent term proportional to the logarithm of the UV cutoff, and that this term is generated solely by torsion.

Motivation: Understanding the role of Hecke operators in various theoretical frameworks has been a central theme in exploring connections between conformal field theory, number theory, and holography.

Method: The equidistribution theorem is applied to Hecke operators to analyze their action in different large $N$ limits.

Result: The contribution from a heavy sector is integrated out, simplifying the partition function to contributions from light states.

Conclusion: This method offers a systematic way to compute gravitational path integrals in the bulk, with potential applications to other areas where large $N$ limits are relevant.

Abstract: Hecke operators acting on modular functions arise naturally in the context of 2d conformal field theory, but in seemingly disparate areas, including permutation orbifold theories, ensembles of code CFTs, and more recently in the context of the AdS$_3$/RMT$_2$ program. We use an equidistribution theorem for Hecke operators to show that in each of these large $N$ limits, an entire heavy sector of the partition function gets integrated out, leaving only contributions from Poincaré series of light states. This gives an immediate holographic interpretation as a sum over semiclassical handlebody geometries. We speculate on further physical interpretations for equidistribution, including a potential ergodicity statement.

Abstract: Modern experimental techniques can generate magnetic fields of the form H(t) = H0 z-hat + H1 [x-hat cos(ωt) + y-hat sin(ωt)], at frequencies within an order of magnitude of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequencies, ωn0 and ωe0, respectively, when acting on atoms or molecules. We derive simple closed-form expressions for the exact nuclear- and electronic-spin wave functions that enable controlled transitions between entangled states, allowing an atom or molecule to function as a quantum computer. These solutions also enable precise NMR or EPR measurements of nuclear moments in atoms and molecules. We present examples relevant to measurements of the nuclear moments of 14N, 7Li, and 133Cs. Because existing hyperfine measurements of the lowest three nuclear moments of 133Cs are mutually inconsistent, the proposed NMR/EPR experiments provide a route to measuring all seven of its nuclear moments with high precision.

Abstract: While Rydberg-Rydberg interactions are essential for quantum nonlinear optics and quantum information processing, their role in microwave and radio-frequency sensing remains poorly understood. Here we experimentally investigate Rydberg interaction-induced nonlinearity in cold-atom Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). In a three-level EIT system, increasing photon-photon interactions produces nonlinear spectral broadening accompanied by resonance shifts, while a microwave-dressed four-level system exhibits pronounced nonlinear broadening without detectable spectral shifts. Our three-level data can be explained by a conditional superatom model, whereas our four-level observations are surprisingly captured by a simple dephasing model. Comparisons with three representative models provide key insights to the role of many-body interactions in Rydberg EIT spectroscopy. Furthermore, our results clarify the conditions under which microwave field characterization can be performed in the nonlinear regime without introducing systematic bias. Our study advances both fundamental understanding of many-body physics and practical development of atomic sensors.

Abstract: We demonstrate a synthetic gauge phase in Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) using room-temperature rubidium vapor. By exploiting polarization selection rules in a ladder-type system involving ground, intermediate, and Rydberg states, multiple Zeeman sublevels form closed-loop transitions that acquire a gauge phase. We show that the relative polarization angle between the linearly polarized probe and coupling lasers directly controls this gauge phase, which modulates the EIT transmission and Rydberg state population, consequently controlling the linewidth of EIT due to Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions between atoms. Our approach provides a simple polarization-based method for realizing synthetic gauge physics and manipulating many-body interactions in atomic ensembles without requiring laser cooling and dipole traps.

Abstract: We map the phase diagram of a two-mode atom-molecule Bose-Einstein condensate with Fano-Feshbach and coherent three-body recombination (cTBR) terms. The standard second order phase transition observed as the molecular energy is tuned through the Feshbach resonance, is replaced by a first order transition when cTBR becomes prominent, due to a double-well structure in the free energy landscape. This transition is associated with atom-molecule entanglement, bistability, and molecular metastability. Our results establish cTBR as a powerful knob for quantum state engineering and control of reaction dynamics in ultracold chemistry.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feasible setup using ultracold atoms and 3D optical Raman lattices to realize unpaired Weyl points and demonstrate the chiral magnetic effect under periodic driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving unpaired Weyl points and observing the chiral magnetic effect are crucial for understanding topological phases and their applications in quantum physics.

Method: Used a combination of ultracold atoms, 3D optical Raman lattices, and periodic driving to engineer effective spin-orbit coupling and manipulate symmetry to create topological phases.

Result: Demonstrated that periodic driving can overcome the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to create unpaired Weyl points and observed a quantized charge current as a signature of the CME.

Conclusion: Established a practical platform for studying chiral anomaly and nonequilibrium topological phenomena using Weyl fermions.

Abstract: In static lattice systems, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem enforces the pairing of Weyl points with opposite chiralities, which precludes the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in equilibrium. Periodic driving provides a viable route to circumvent this no-go constraint. Here, we propose a scheme to realize and control unpaired Weyl points using ultracold atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical Raman lattice under continuous periodic driving. By engineering distinct relative symmetries between the lattice and multiple Raman potentials, the configuration generates an effective 3D spin-orbit coupling and yields a tunable topological-insulator phase. Through adiabatic periodic modulation of this system, we show that eight Weyl points emerge in the quasienergy spectrum of the low-energy sector, whose net chirality can be precisely tuned. A nonzero total chirality directly corresponds to the formation of unpaired Weyl points. Furthermore, by implementing a synthetic magnetic field via laser-assisted tunneling in this setup, we demonstrate that the chirality imbalance drives a quantized charge current in the weak-field regime, providing a direct signature of the CME. We verify that the adiabatic condition of the driving protocol, as well as the proposed experimental preparation and detection techniques, are within reach of current ultracold-atom experiments. This work establishes a realistic and controllable platform for exploring chiral-anomaly physics and nonequilibrium topological phenomena linked to Weyl fermions.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collisions between ultracold polar molecules in the presence of two lasers ensuring a Raman resonant transition on individual molecules to suppress photon scattering, taking the example of bosonic $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules. By varying laser detunings and intensities, we enable a repulsive long-range interaction potential between molecules. After solving a set of coupled Schrödinger equations with the Hamiltonian written in the basis of laser-dressed states of the molecule pair at infinite distance, we identify quasi-resonant conditions under which elastic collisions are favored over inelastic and reactive ones, by a factor of about 2, thus demonstrating a promising pathway for efficient two-photon optical shielding of ultracold molecular collisions. The results are analyzed in terms of scattering length of the colliding laser-dressed molecules, which exhibit prominent resonances assigned to the interaction of the entrance channel with other specific channels, consistent with the existence of a quasi-bound level of the long-range molecular pair induced by the lasers.

Abstract: Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in a matter-wave microscope allows access to various long-range off-diagonal correlators in experimentally realistic settings, realizing a many-body phase microscope. We demonstrate in particular how the fermionic d-wave superconducting order parameter in arbitrary Hubbard-type models, the non-equal time Green's function yielding the spectral function, or the hidden order of composite bosons in a fractional Chern insulator can be directly measured. Our results show the great potential of matter-wave microscopy for accessing exotic correlators including phases and coherences and characterizing intriguing quantum many-body states.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The four-boson universality suggests the existence of the second excited tetramer state in a system of cold ${}^4\mathrm{He}$ atoms. It is not bound but could be seen as a resonance in the atom-trimer scattering. This process is rigorously calculated using the momentum-space transition operator framework with two realistic interatomic potentials. The $S$-wave phase shift and cross section show a resonant behavior below the excited trimer threshold, but there are sizable nonresonant contributions from $P$ and $D$ waves as well. The position and width of the resonant state is determined, and for the latter significant finite-range effects are found.

Abstract: A hybrid quantum computing architecture combining quantum processors and quantum memory units allows for exploiting each component's unique properties to enhance the overall performance of the total system. However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator. Our results enable scalable hybrid quantum architectures with low-loss integration, marking a key step toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms.

TL;DR: Hybrid photon counting detectors (HPCDs) improve x-ray-based measurements with high quantum efficiency and ultra-low dark counts. They are applied for advanced lab-based nanoscale x-ray tomography (nano-xCT), achieving 40 times more photons collected, 20 times faster than previous work, resulting in an overall 800x speedup. Their use for real-time imaging is validated using MTF, FSC, and CNR metrics, achieving 75-80 nm spatial resolution for 160 nm wiring features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper criticized the previous work by suggesting that HPCDs could significantly accelerate and improve image quality in x-ray tomography.

Method: They performed nano-xCT on an integrated circuit at the 130-nm node using HPCDs, collected more photons, and validated their system using MTF, FSC, and CNR metrics.

Result: They achieved an 800x speedup in x-ray imaging with high-quality 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: HPCDs are transformative for real-time, high-resolution x-ray imaging applications such as nanoscale x-ray tomography.

Abstract: Hybrid photon counting detectors (HPCDs) have unlocked new capabilities for x-ray-based measurements at synchrotrons around the world in the last 30 years. By leveraging independently optimized sensor and readout layers, they offer high quantum efficiency ($> 80 \%$), ultra-low dark counts, sub-pixel point-spread function, and high count rates ($> 10^{6}$ counts per pixel per second). Furthermore, their small pixel size and large active area endow them with excellent coverage and resolution for both real-space and reciprocal space imaging. Here, we demonstrate that HPCDs are also well-suited for laboratory-based nanoscale x-ray tomography (nano-xCT). We perform nano-xCT on an integrated circuit fabricated at the 130-nm node and produce a 3D reconstruction with 40 times more photons collected 20 times faster than in this group's previous work, for an overall speedup of 800$\times$. We review the technical considerations of using an HPCD for tabletop tomography. We quantify our reconstruction image quality using well-established metrics, including the modulation transfer function (MTF), Fourier shell correlation (FSC), and contrast-to-noise (CNR), to validate our choice of experimental parameters that provide sufficient resolution and imaging speed. Using these metrics, we determine that even under current experimental conditions, 160 nm wiring features are reconstructed at 75-80 nm spatial resolution.

Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the thermal neutron sensitive transparent glass scintillator SG101, benchmarked against the conventional LiF ZnS(Ag)based scintillator EJ426. The detection efficiency, energy resolution, and pulse shape discrimination (PSD) performance ofSG101 were evaluated under AmBe neutron irradiation. When coupled with organic scintillators(EJ200 or EJ276),the SG101 EJ200 system achieves a figure of merit (FOM) of 3.81 for thermal neutron/gamma separation, while the SG101 EJ276 configuration resolves three distinct particle populations gamma rays, fast neutrons, and thermal neutrons with FOM values of 3.46 and2.21, respectively. Correlation analysis reveals that the number of fast thermal neutron coincidence events significantly exceeds the accidental background, and the count of gamma fast thermal neutron triple-coincidence events is also far higher than the expected accidental rate, confirming significant physical correlations for both event types within a 100 us time window. These results demonstrate that SG101 is a promising candidate for applications requiring high-efficiency thermal neutron detection and precise event tagging coupling with a scintillator with PSD approach

Abstract: This paper presents a GPU-accelerated simulation package,
  TRED, for next-generation neutrino detectors with pixelated
  charge readout, leveraging community-driven software ecosystems to
  ensure sustainability and extensibility. We introduce two generic
  contributions: (i) an effective-charge calculation based on Gaussian
  quadrature rules for numerical integration, and (ii) a sparse,
  block-binned tensor representation that enables efficient FFT-based
