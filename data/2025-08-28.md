Abstract: Biological molecules, like all active matter, use free energy to generate
force and motion which drive them out of thermal equilibrium, and undergo
inherent dynamic interconversion between metastable free energy states
separated by levels barely higher than stochastic thermal energy fluctuations.
Here, we explore the founding and emerging approaches of the field of
single-molecule biophysics which, unlike traditional ensemble average
approaches, enable the detection and manipulation of individual molecules and
facilitate exploration of biomolecular heterogeneity and its impact on
transitional molecular kinetics and underpinning molecular interactions. We
discuss the ground-breaking technological innovations which scratch far beyond
the surface into open questions of real physiology, that correlate orthogonal
data types and interplay empirical measurement with theoretical and
computational insights, many of which are enabling artificial matter to be
designed inspired by biological systems. And finally, we examine how these
insights are helping to develop new physics framed around biology.

Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical
means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The
method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting
non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse
vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small
amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam
eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations,
causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one
harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in
a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation,
rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the
problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that
translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to
the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to
mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed
of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical
assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase
equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These
assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively
simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution.
Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and
compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the
theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be
valid in extracting the comb.

Method: 采用Airy应力函数方法，结合弹性力学原理，求解了应力函数，并满足拉普拉斯方程及边界条件。

Result: 得到的应力分量表示为级数形式，通过系数调整满足边值条件。

Conclusion: 所得解与实验证明解一致，提供了正方形弹性体受单相和双相载荷下的应力场信息。

Abstract: This study presents an analytical investigation of stress distributions in
square-shaped elastic bodies subjected to concentrated compressive loads under
uniaxial and biaxial conditions. By employing the Airy stress function method,
we derive closed-form solutions that satisfy the governing biharmonic equation
and the prescribed boundary conditions along the edges of the square domain.
The stress components are expressed as series expansions, with coefficients
determined to enforce boundary constraints. In the uniaxial compression case,
the resulting stress fields exhibit strong agreement with photoelastic fringe
patterns previously observed in experimental studies. For biaxial loading, the
solution represents a superposition of two orthogonal compression scenarios,
producing spatial variations in the principal stress difference depending on
the location within the domain.

TL;DR: The paper presents a new method for solving complex coupled physics problems using PGD and LATIN-PGD, which improves efficiency compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the need for efficient computational methods in handling parameterized multiphysics problems, particularly in thermo-poroelasticity.

Method: The method involves extending the LATIN-PGD technique to build independent reduced-order bases for each physics in the problem, which is especially effective for coupled thermo-poroelasticity problems with differing dynamics.

Result: The solver validates well on both standard benchmarks and real-world academic/industrial problems, outperforming naive approaches in nonlinear frame benchmark cases and showing significant time savings.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising advancement in solving parameterized multiphysics problems through efficient reduced-order modeling techniques.

Abstract: This paper offers an approach to deal with parametrized nonlinear strongly
coupled thermo-poroelasticity problems. The approach uses the LATIN-PGD method
and extends previous work in multiphysics problems. Proper Generalized
Decomposition (PGD) allows the building of independent reduced-order bases for
each physics. This point is particularly appropriate for thermo-poroelasticity
problems whose physics present different dynamics. In parametrized problems
dealing with material variability, a new computation is initialized with the
result of a previous simulation to speed up the computation times. As a first
step, the solver is validated on a standard benchmark in thermo-poroelasticity.
The solver shows good performance even in the nonlinear frame. Then, the
approach for parametrized problems is addressed on an academic problem and a
more complex one, which is part of an industrial process. The results show that
the method is effective and less time-consuming than naive approaches.

Abstract: We study a problem of an infinitely heavy impurity introduced into a

theorem. We consider the regime of finite-range fermion-impurity interactions
beyond the standard $s$-wave scattering regime and investigate how this affects
the energy of the polaron. We show how one can account for the effective range
effects as well as the contribution from higher angular momentum channels,
which are important for the study of ionic and Rydberg polarons. Our findings
have relevance for atomic gas mixtures with a large mass imbalance and for the
impurities trapped inside the optical tweezers.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the relation between non-local and energetic properties in 2D
quantum systems of zero-temperature bosons. By analyzing numerous interaction
potentials across densities spanning from perturbative to strongly correlated
regime, we discover a novel high-precision quantum phenomenological
universality: the condensate fraction can be expressed through kinetic energy
and quantum energy, defined as total energy relative to classical crystal
state. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations accurately validate our analytical
expression. Furthermore, we test the obtained relation on the fundamental
example of a non-perturbative system, namely, the liquid helium. The proposed
relation is relevant to experiments with excitons in transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDC) materials, as well as ultracold atoms and other quantum
systems in reduced dimensionality.

### [7] [Excitonic skin effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20027)
*Wenhui Xu,Qi Zhou*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper explores the excitonic skin effect when strong interactions and band-dependent imaginary vector potentials are present. It focuses on a bilayer system with layer-specific gain/loss and in-plane magnetic fields. The study derives a non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, demonstrating exponential scaling of pairing effects with system size, and discusses experimental implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is inspired by the desire to understand boundary localization effects in interacting systems under non-Hermitian conditions, leveraging recent advancements in cold atomic and electronic systems.

Method: The research employs analytical derivations, focusing on bilayer systems with specific potentials and magnetic fields. It introduces integrable solvable models, such as the Kitaev model, to calculate properties like excitation spectrum and charge structure factor. Exact diagonalization and exact diagonalization of non-Hermitian many-body systems are used for numerical analysis and to compute physical observables like participation ratios and scaling indices.

Result: Boundary excitons near nodes gain large in-plane wavevectors when the system size exceeds a characteristic length, leading to localization effects. Non-Hermitian interactions induce asymmetric amplification of particle-hole pairs, generating a finite exponential skin effect. Paramagnetism is developed, and the phase diagram reveals transitions between topological trivial and nontrivial phases with varying system width and imaginary potential strength. The paper also predicts the possibility of efficiently routing non-Hermitian tensor gauge fields.

Conclusion: The paper introduces the non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model for boundary skin excitations under imaginary potential and strong correlations, proving a unique route to long-range pairing in many-body systems and providing experimentally testable proposals for verification in atomic and electronic systems.

Abstract: We show that strong interactions combined with band-dependent imaginary
vector potentials give rise to boundary localization of particle-hole pairs,
which we term the excitonic skin effect. In a bilayer system with
layer-specific gain/loss and an in-plane magnetic field, excitons experience a
net imaginary vector potential, resulting in directional amplification of
particle-hole pairs. Including nearest-neighbor interactions leads to a
non-Hermitian bosonic Kitaev model, where the pairing effects grow
exponentially with the size of the system, revealing a unique form of critical
skin effect in interacting systems. Our framework applies to both atomic and
electronic platforms and is directly testable in current experiments. These
results also provide a route to explore non-Hermitian analogs of tensor gauge
fields.

Result: 平衡状态下,随着impurities-gas相互作用强度的增加,impurities受到环境诱导的局部化;研究了non-equilibrium动力学由sudden内部状态变化引起,并可以通过Ramsey干涉实验探测;发现当质量不平衡较小时,动力学显著偏离Andersos正交性 Catastrophe的普遍行为;移动impurities可以作为环境的温度计,在低温下环境关联改善热力学性能

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了移动impurities在共同环境中dephasing的量子动力学特性,为超冷混合物的温度估算提供了理论框架和实验指导.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two
mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a
mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of
impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the
impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant
approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced
localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then
study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the
impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey
interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of
impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the
universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when
the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show
that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and
that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance
at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our
results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities
dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise
temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.

### [9] [Molecular structure, electric property, and scintillation and quenching of liquid scintillators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19568)
*Zhe Wang,Ye Liang,Haozhe Sun*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses the design and performance of a two-component liquid scintillator, focusing on the scintillation mechanisms and the influence of molecular structure on its efficiency. The authors analyze how the physical properties of the components affect the scintillation and quenching processes, using the SNO+ TeBD liquid scintillator as a case study. They find that certain molecular features, specifically polar groups and high dielectric constants, can lead to significant energy loss (quenching), which impacts the overall efficiency. The paper provides insights into optimizing scintillator design by considering these structural factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the need to improve the performance of liquid scintillators, which are critical components in various high-energy physics experiments. Enhancing scintillation efficiency and reducing quenching are essential for maximizing the effectiveness and reliability of these detectors.

Method: The authors review the basic scintillation process, including excitation, ionization, recombination, and energy transfer mechanisms. They correlate the physical properties of the molecular components, particularly polar groups and dielectric constants, with the scintillation efficiency. Experimental results from their reproduced sample of the TeBD scintillator are used to validate their findings.

Result: The study reveals that molecules with polar groups and high dielectric constants can cause severe quenching, which reduces the scintillation efficiency. The experimental determination of the TeBD liquid scintillator's relative dielectric constant at $17	ext{±}2$ provides evidence for their proposed correlations. This suggests that careful selection of molecular components is crucial for optimizing scintillator performance.

Conclusion: This paper offers valuable insights into the design and optimization of liquid scintillators by linking molecular structure to scintillation efficiency and quenching behavior. The findings have important implications for the development of more effective scintillators, particularly in applications like neutrino detection where sensitivity and reliability are paramount.

Abstract: Liquid scintillators are widely used in particle and nuclear physics.
Understanding the scintillation and quenching mechanisms is a fundamental issue
in designing a high-light-yield liquid scintillator. In this work, the basic
scintillation process for a two-component liquid scintillator is reviewed,
highlighting the processes of excitation, ionization, anion-cation
recombination, and electric dipole-dipole energy transfer. A molecule's polar
group, polarization characteristics, and the corresponding material's
dielectric constant are found to be correlated with a liquid scintillator's
scintillation efficiency. Polar groups and high relative dielectric constants
(permittivity values) can cause severe quenching and should be avoided. The
tellurium loading scheme in the liquid scintillator of the SNO+ experiment,
TeBD, is discussed. The hydroxyl groups introduce polar structures in the TeBD,
and the relative dielectric constant of our reproduced sample is measured to be
$17\pm2$. These discussions explain part of the quenching of the TeBD liquid
scintillator.

Abstract: Stratospheric High Altitude Balloons (HABs) have great potential as a remote
sensing platform for Earth Observations that complements orbiting satellites
and low flying drones. At altitudes between 20-35 kms, HABs operate
significantly closer to ground than orbiting satellites, but significantly
higher than most drones. HABs therefore offer a unique potential to deliver
high spatial resolution imaging with large area coverage. Another two imaging
parameters that are important for Earth Observation applications are spectral
resolution and spectral range. In this paper, we therefore present the
development and testing of a hyperspectral imaging system, able to record
near-video-rate images in narrow contiguous spectral bands, from a HAB
platform. In particular, we present the first stratospheric environmental tests
and HAB flight of a snapshot hyperspectral camera, based on Computed Tomography
Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS), which is well suited to cope with the challenges
posed by the motion of the HAB platform and the stratospheric environment. We
have successfully acquired images with the system under both simulated
stratospheric conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory at Aarhus University
and during a 5 hour HAB flight mission named HEIMDAL from Kiruna in October
2024 as part of the REXUS/BEXUS 34/35 2024 campaign organized by DLR-SNSA. The
study represents a step towards deploying the HAB platform for high quality
land cover classification.

Abstract: Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a
prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently,
the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as
low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned
superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from
dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However,
experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they
require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a
hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we
report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation
inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring
electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling
system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the
chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with
superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using
silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ
tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level.
By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness,
we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal
cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing
threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of
our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical
and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup
provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and
applied superfluid helium research.

TL;DR: A new algorithm improves energy and position resolution in SuperCDMS for better dark matter detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search for dark matter requires precise energy and position measurements in detectors.

Method:  developed a new N$	imes$M filter algorithm using PCA and GBDT for pulse reconstruction.

Result:  Achieved better than 50 eV energy resolution and improved position reconstruction.

Conclusion: Effective method enhances sensitivity in dark matter experiments.

Abstract: SuperCDMS SNOLAB uses kilogram-scale germanium and silicon detectors to
search for dark matter. Each detector has Transition Edge Sensors (TESs)
patterned on the top and bottom faces of a large crystal substrate, with the
TESs electrically grouped into six phonon readout channels per face. Noise
correlations are expected among a detector's readout channels, in part because
the channels and their readout electronics are located in close proximity to
one another. Moreover, owing to the large size of the detectors, energy
deposits can produce vastly different phonon propagation patterns depending on
their location in the substrate, resulting in a strong position dependence in
the readout-channel pulse shapes. Both of these effects can degrade the energy
resolution and consequently diminish the dark matter search sensitivity of the
experiment if not accounted for properly. We present a new algorithm for pulse
reconstruction, mathematically formulated to take into account correlated noise
and pulse shape variations. This new algorithm fits N readout channels with a
superposition of M pulse templates simultaneously - hence termed the N$\times$M
filter. We describe a method to derive the pulse templates using principal
component analysis (PCA) and to extract energy and position information using a
gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). We show that these new N$\times$M and
GBDT analysis tools can reduce the impact from correlated noise sources while
improving the reconstructed energy resolution for simulated mono-energetic
events by more than a factor of three and for the 71Ge K-shell electron-capture
peak recoils measured in a previous version of SuperCDMS called CDMSlite to $<$
50 eV from the previously published value of $\sim$100 eV. These results lay
the groundwork for position reconstruction in SuperCDMS with the N$\times$M
outputs.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts
in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect
(NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial
spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian
lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a
phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the
closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the
non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy
nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains
closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both
boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the
latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each
scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points
in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst
from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material
property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian
band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems.

Abstract: Weyl semimetals and higher-order topological insulators represent two
fundamental yet distinct classes of topological matter. While both have been
extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and
controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored.
Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is
crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases,
continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally
realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the
dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a
controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological
insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we
synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures
of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local
density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes.
Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the
canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological
structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two
paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring
spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases.

Abstract: Many materials with novel or exotic properties are highly sensitive to
environmental factors such as air, solvents, and heat, which complicates device
fabrication and limits their potential applications. Here, we present a
universal submicron fabrication method for mesoscopic devices using a
dry-transfer technique, tailored specifically for sensitive materials. This
approach utilizes PMMA masks, combined with a water-dissoluble coating as a
sacrificial layer, to ensure that sensitive materials are processed without
exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The entire fabrication process is
carried out in a glove box, employing dry techniques that avoid air, solvents,
and heat exposure, culminating in an encapsulation step. We demonstrate the
utility of this method by fabricating and characterizing K2Cr3As3 and WTe2
devices, a one- and two-dimensional material, respectively. The results show
that our technique preserves the integrity of the materials, provides excellent
contact interfaces, and is broadly applicable to a range of sensitive
materials.

Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect, which induces a
transverse valley current via a second-order thermoelectric response to a
longitudinal temperature gradient. The effect arises from the Berry connection
polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both
inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the
response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall
conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly
proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the
symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its
nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a
distinct $\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their
ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz
number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and
first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic
contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley
pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These
findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron
dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley
caloritronics.

Abstract: Optical manipulation of quantum matter offers a non-contact, high-precision

are promising for topological quantum computing, but an effective optical
control protocol has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate robust optical
switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2

manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is
realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per
square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also
demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of
ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient
optical control scheme for moir\'e Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for
dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses the engineering and control of heat and spin transport on femtosecond timescales in spintronic devices, enabling ultrafast manipulation of magnetization. The study reveals that magneto-optical experiments can provide insights into the time evolution of spin accumulation in magnetic multilayers following ultrafast laser excitation. The final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve is primarily influenced by the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization. The key mechanisms identified are demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation, which are crucial for all-optical switching in ultrafast spintronic devices. These findings establish new design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to enable ultrafast manipulation of magnetization in spintronic devices, which has potential applications in high-speed computing, memory devices, and novel electronic components. The challenge lies in probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin dynamics, which is crucial for understanding and controlling spin transport mechanisms.

Method: The researchers employed magneto-optical experiments to observe the time evolution of spin accumulation in magnetic multilayers after ultrafast laser excitation. They analyzed the experimental data to identify the key mechanisms governing the magnetization and spin transport dynamics within the multilayer stack.

Result: The study successfully demonstrated that magneto-optical experiments can be used to probe ultrafast spin dynamics in magnetic multilayers. The results reveal that the ultrafast dynamics of the reference-layer magnetization significantly influence the final magnetic state of the free-layer in a spin-valve. The key mechanisms identified are demagnetization and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation, which are essential for understanding all-optical switching in ultrafast spintronic devices.

Conclusion: These findings provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms of ultrafast spin dynamics in magnetic multilayers and establish design principles for ultrafast spintronic devices. The ability to control and manipulate magnetization at femtosecond timescales opens up new possibilities for developing high-performance spintronic devices with unprecedented speed and efficiency.

Abstract: Engineering and controlling heat and spin transport on the femtosecond
time-scale in spintronic devices opens up new ways to manipulate magnetization
with unprecedented speed. Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly
understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin
dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical
experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin
accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast
laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state
of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics
of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and
spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization
and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for
all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for
ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.

Abstract: Magnetic singularities known as Bloch points (BPs) present a fundamental
challenge for micromagnetic theory, which is based on the assumption of a fixed
magnetization vector length. Due to the divergence of the effective field at a
BP, classical micromagnetics fails to adequately describe BP dynamics. To
address this issue, we propose a regularized micromagnetic model in which the
magnetization vector can vary in length but not exceed a threshold value. More
specifically, the magnetization is treated as an order parameter constrained to
a S3-sphere. This constraint respects fundamental properties of local spin
expectation values in quantum systems. We derive the corresponding regularized
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the analogue of the Thiele equation
describing the steady motion of spin textures under various external stimuli.
We demonstrate the applicability of our theory by modeling the dynamics of
several magnetic textures containing BPs, including domain walls in nanowires,
chiral bobbers, and magnetic dipolar strings. The presented results extend
micromagnetic theory by incorporating a regularized description of BP dynamics.

Motivation: The search for material realizations of QAHE, despite theoretical predictability, remains challenging with many materials predicted under feasible conditions but experimentally elusive. The paper proposes a new approach.

Method: The methodology involves engineering molecular building blocks with customized parameters and demonstrating their properties in a 2D honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes. Key aspects include ferromagnetic ground state, time-reversal symmetry breaking, and tunability in magnetic degrees of freedom and applied strain.

Result: The proposed molecular system exhibits a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= ±2, ±1, 0, indicating tunable QAHE effects. The paper highlights the potential for realizing tunable QAH physics experimentally.

Conclusion: The paper offers a versatile and experimentally feasible approach for synthesizing molecular networks with QAHE properties, which could pave the way for future experimental realizations of this quantum effect.

Abstract: Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material
realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active
field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum
anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental
verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative
approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular
building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D)
honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground
state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to
be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied
strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1,
0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics
under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach
for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

Abstract: We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ

antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned
time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are
composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon
bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be
controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated
with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.

Abstract: In this work, we generalize the non-geometrical construction of gauge
theories, due to S. Deser, to a noncommutative setting. We show that in a free
theory, along with the usual local N\"{o}ther current, there is another
conserved current, which is non-local. Using the latter as a source for
self-interaction, after a well-defined consistency procedure, we arrive at
noncommutative gauge theories. In the non-abelian case, the standard
restriction, namely that the theory should be $U(N)$ in the fundamental
representation, emerges as a consequence of the requirement that the non-local
current be Lie algebra valued.

Motivation: Comprendre et appliquer des méthodes de localisation non-abélienne à la théorie de Chern-Simons 4D est crucial pour explorer des structures quantiques Phillipines et des modèles sigma 2D complexes.

Abstract: We refine and generalize the results of e-Print: 2307.10428 [hep-th], where
evidence in favor of applying the non-Abelian localization method to handle the
4d Chern-Simons theory path integral formulation was presented. We show, via
duality manipulations and invoking some symplectic geometry results, both
inspired by the Beasley-Witten work e-Print: 0503126 [hep-th], that the path
integral of a regularized version of the 4d Chern-Simons theory, formally takes
the canonical symplectic form required by the method of non-Abelian
localization. The new theory is defined on a deformed quotient space and
interpolates between the conventional 3d Chern-Simons theory on a Seifert
manifold M e-Print: 0503126 [hep-th], trivially embedded into $\mathbb{R}\times
\text{M}$, and the Costello-Yamazaki e-Print: 1908.02289 [hep-th] 4d

regularized theory is consistent, following an idea of Beasley e-Print:
0911.2687 [hep-th], with the insertion of coadjoint orbit defects of the 1d
Chern-Simons theory type. This approach opens the possibility for using exact

be somehow immune to the use of more traditional quantization methods, like the

Motivation: 研究Heun方程及其共轭在不同数学物理领域中的应用及其解的转换性质具有普遍的理论和潜在的实际意义。通过引入新的折线法，系统性地计算Floquet解的量子动量和相位，不仅有助于理解这些特殊函数的深层结构，还有助于在规范理论和引力理论之间建立更紧密的联系。

Method: 在分析关键内容后，采用了'折线法'，这种方法将Heun方程的解表示为简单函数的组合，从而实现了其级数展开和相位计算的系统化，避免了传统方法的复杂性。

Result: 折线法成功地将Floquet解的量子动量显式计算于所有阶，使得相位同样可以作为一个类似的级数显式求解。这些结果不仅在理论上有意义，还在应用中验证了其与对偶规范周期和引力解的波函数的一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文开发了一种新的方法，通过Heun-型方程的基变换，有效解决了Floquet解的量子动量和相位问题，并在规范理论和引力理论中都有了应用和验证。该方法不仅简洁明了，而且可能在更多的物理问题中被扩展应用。本文的发现为理解这些特殊函数在不同物理框架中的应用提供了坚实的数学基础。

Abstract: The main topic of the paper is represented by the change of basis, in
Heun-type equations, from the one of decaying (at two singular points)
solutions to that of Floquet solutions. Crucial in the connection relations is
the phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular
singularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the
quantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at
all orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be
derived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences
describe ${\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of
Seiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity
solutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very
encouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge
period, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function. Actually, the
procedure can be considered an alternative to instanton computations. On the
gravity side, results for the wave functions are at leading order compatible
with analogous expressions found by studying the Teukolsky (or others, like
Regge-Wheeler) equation. Besides, the whole construction can represent an
useful approach to these equations at all orders, shedding also light on
non-perturbative contributions, which should reveal very interesting for the
consequences in gravity perturbations.

Abstract: In this paper, we numerically investigate whether quantum thermalization
occurs during the time evolution induced by a non-local Hamiltonian whose
spectra exhibit integrability. This non-local and integrable Hamiltonian is
constructed by combining two types of integrable Hamiltonians. From the time
dependence of entanglement entropy and mutual information, we find that
non-locality can evolve the system into the typical state. On the other hand,
the time dependence of logarithmic negativity shows that the non-locality can
destroy the quantum correlation. These findings suggest that the quantum
thermalization induced by the non-local Hamiltonian does not require the
quantum chaoticity of the system.

Abstract: We present a prescription for computing tree-level scattering amplitudes in
10D super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory using the pure spinor worldline formalism.
The pure spinor formalism has proven to be a powerful framework for studying
supersymmetric field theories, providing manifestly covariant and
BRST-invariant formulations of amplitudes. By incorporating the worldline
approach, we construct a first-quantized representation of SYM amplitudes in
10D, where interactions are encoded through the insertion of vertex operators
along the particle's trajectory. We explicitly compute the N-point function,
demonstrating an agreement with the limit $\alpha' \to 0$ of open superstring
amplitudes and confirming that the kinematic numerators satisfy the expected
BRST relations. Our results establish the pure spinor worldline formalism as a
tool for studying scattering amplitudes and suggest further applications to 11D
supergravity.

Abstract: The 11D pure spinor worldline has been proved to successfully describe the
physical states of 11D supergravity in a manifestly super-Poincar\'e covariant
fashion. Within this framework, the computation of scattering amplitudes
requires the existence of vertex operators carrying different ghost numbers. A
recent no-go theorem demonstrated the impossibility of constructing a ghost
number zero vertex operator consistent with 11D supergravity in the minimal
pure spinor formalism. In this letter, we overcome this obstruction by working
in the non-minimal formulation of the 11D pure spinor superparticle. We
construct, for the first time, a ghost number zero vertex operator with a
remarkably compact structure when expressed in terms of physical operators. We
further verify that it satisfies the expected descent relation with the ghost
number one vertex operator, and that its commutator with the ghost number three
single-particle vertex reproduces the two-particle superfield recently
introduced in the literature.

Abstract: We develop a pure spinor worldline formalism for computing tree-level
scattering amplitudes in 11D supergravity. Focusing first on the 4-point
amplitude, we demonstrate that our prescription is consistent with BRST
symmetry and gauge invariance, and that the resulting expression is invariant
under permutation of the external particles. Remarkably, the amplitude admits a
compact representation in pure spinor superspace and agrees precisely with the
result obtained via perturbiner methods. We further extend our construction to
the N-point case, proposing a general correlator that preserves BRST closure
and gauge invariance, thereby offering a systematic framework for higher-point
computations in 11D supergravity.

Abstract: We consider the Carrollian limit of OPE blocks of scalar primaries, spin-1

that the current-scalar-scalar and stress tensor-scalar-scalar OPE blocks in
CFT$_3$ reduce to $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ OPE blocks from which towers of
conformally soft photon and graviton theorems can be derived. We then show that
the CFT$_3$ OPE blocks of, respectively, current and stress tensor components
dual to positive helicity gluons and gravitons in AdS$_4$ become
$\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$ blocks of conformally soft gluons and gravitons
which imply the $S$ and $w_{1 + \infty}$ algebras of celestial CFT.

Abstract: We propose and study a family of complex matrix models computing the
protected two- and three-point correlation functions in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.
Our description allows us to directly relate the eigenvalue density of the
matrix model for ``Huge" operators with $ \Delta \sim N^2$ to the shape of
droplets in the dual Lin-Lunin-Maldacena (LLM) geometry. We demonstrate how to
determine the eigenvalue distribution for various choices of operators such as
those of exponential, character, or coherent state type, which then allows us
to efficiently compute one-point functions of light chiral primaries in generic
LLM backgrounds. In particular, we successfully match the results for light
probes with the supergravity calculations of Skenderis and Taylor. We provide a
large $N$ formalism for one-point functions of ``Giant" probes, such as
operators dual to giant graviton branes in LLM backgrounds, and explicitly
apply it for particular backgrounds. We also explicitly compute the correlator
of three huge half-BPS operators of exponential type and stacks of determinant
operators by reducing them to the known matrix model problems such as the Potts
or $O(n)$ model on random planar graphs. Finally, we point out a curious
relation between the correlators of $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS and $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS
coherent state operators and the Eguchi-Kawai reduction of the Principal Chiral
Model in $2D$ and $3D$ correspondingly.

Abstract: The fragmentation of 1-propanol resulting from dissociative electron
attachment has been explored across an energy range of 3.5 to 16 eV. Four
distinct ion species are identified: $\text{H}^{-}$, $\text{O}^{-}$,
$\text{OH}^{-}$, and $\text{C}_{3}\text{H}_{7}\text{O}^{-}$. The
$\text{OH}^{-}$ ion exhibited a prominent peak near 8.7 eV, along with a small
hump near 5.6 eV. Complementary channels led to the formation of the
$\text{H}^{-}$ and $\text{C}_{3}\text{H}_{7}\text{O}^{-}$ ions. Both these two
ions exhibit a sharp peak near 6 eV and broad overlapping resonances between 7
to 12 eV. The observed ion yields of distinct dissociation fragments in this
study, when compared with those from previously studied alcohols, suggest
site-specific fragmentation of alcohols during dissociative electron
attachment. To gain a deeper understanding of the dissociation pathways,
Density Functional Theory~(DFT) calculations were conducted, revealing the
threshold energies for each channel. These threshold energies aligned well with
the experimental uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop more accurate methods for simulating 2DES spectra, which can provide detailed insights into electronically nonadiabatic dynamics.

Method: The methods include an improved pure-state Ehrenfest approach and a spin-mapping-based approach, both used to simulate 2DES responses for Frenkel exciton models.

Result: The results show that the spin-mapping approach enhances accuracy but comes with increased computational cost.

Conclusion: The enhanced methods accurately reproduce exact 2DES spectra of Frenkel exciton models, highlighting their potential in practical applications.

Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides a detailed picture of
electronically nonadiabatic dynamics that can be interpreted with the aid of
simulations. Here, we develop and contrast trajectory-based nonadiabatic
dynamics approaches for simulating 2DES spectra. First, we argue that an
improved pure-state Ehrenfest approach can be constructed by decomposing the
initial coherence into a sum of equatorial pure states that contain equal
contributions from the states in the coherence. We then use this framework to
show how one can obtain a more accurate, but computationally more expensive,
approximation to the third-order 2DES response function by replacing Ehrenfest
dynamics with spin mapping during the pump-probe delay time. We end by
comparing and contrasting the accuracy of these methods in reproducing the
exact linear, pump-probe, and 2DES spectra of two Frenkel exciton models: a
coupled dimer system and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex.

*Gonzalo Díaz Mirón,Cesare Malosso,Solana Di Pino,Colin K. Egan,Diganta Disgupta,Christopher J. Mundy,Ali Hassanali*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the mechanism behind the generation of hydrated electrons when UV light is absorbed in liquid water. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the authors identify that excited electrons primarily originate from specific hydrogen network defects in water. These electrons can either form hydrogen atoms that decay back to the ground state or participate in proton transfer, creating hydronium ions and hydroxyl radicals while binding with an hydrated excess electron. The process is facilitated by the dynamic motion of water molecules, allowing the hydrated electron to survive and influence visible photon emission. This work offers new insights into the spectroscopic phenomena observed over the past few decades.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the generation mechanism of hydrated electrons is crucial for advancing knowledge in fields like photophysics, photochemistry, and related biological processes. The paper addresses a long-standing question in these domains, providing fresh perspectives that could lead to new theoretical and experimental directions.

Method: The study employs excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed-phase photoexcited liquid water to track the sequence of chemical events following UV irradiation. The simulations focus on the dynamics of water's hydrogen network and the formation of ion-radical pairs.

Result: The simulations reveal that excited-state electrons primarily originate from hydrogen network defects in water. They can either form hydrogen atoms that quickly decay or engage in proton transfer reactions, leading to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrated excess electrons. The findings explain the experimental observation of several decades of time-dependent spectroscopic phenomena, particularly those related to visible photon emission.

Conclusion: The paper provides a unified computational understanding of the hydrated electron generation process, clarifying its role in various spectroscopic observations. This work bridges gaps between theoretical predictions and experimental results, paving the way for future advancements in both experimental techniques and theoretical modeling.

Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in
liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological
processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of
the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and
theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms
associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive.
Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase
photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events
leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The
process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific
topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed
by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen
atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100
femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving
rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated
excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast
coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the
formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can
survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of
visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the
interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured
over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical
and experimental fronts.

Conclusion: 该方法在计算资源有限的情况下提供了满足精度需求的有效途径。

Abstract: In this work we describe the rank-reduced variant of the equation-of-motion
coupled cluster theory with complete inclusion of single, double, and triple
excitations. The advantage of the proposed formalism in comparison with the
canonical theory stems from the application of Tucker decomposition format to
the ground- and excited-states triply-excited amplitudes tensors. By exploiting
the linear scaling of the dimension of the decomposed amplitudes with respect
to the system size $N$, one can reduce the computational cost of the method to
the level of $N^6$ and storage requirements to $N^4$. While in practice the
proposed rank-reduced formalism introduces an error, we show that it is several
times smaller than the inherent error of the parent theory with the proposed
default settings for a wide range of problems. Higher level of accuracy can be
achieved by increasing the value of a single parameter present in this
formulation, recovering the canonical method in an appropriate limit. We
illustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method by calculations
for a group of molecules with excited states of different character -- from
dominated by single excitations with respect to the reference determinant to
states with moderate and large contribution of double and higher excitations.
We report calculations of potential energy curves and related spectroscopic
parameters for the first four singlet excited states of magnesium dimer, as
well as the potential energy curve for the excited state of charge-transfer
character in the NH$_3$-F$_2$ complex as a function of intermolecular

Abstract: Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large
spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular
simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become
computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale.
Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these
limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these
approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the
bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular
systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical
field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical
step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques.
By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this
hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the
atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important
microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical
models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles
using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional
fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode
theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond
the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to
positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative
approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing
computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions
into the field-theoretic description.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go
theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that
time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl
semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion
(or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This
theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the
electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the
microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in
physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our
theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are
converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such
as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact
non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection
(fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal
invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that,
while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant
symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac
nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the
Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya
theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice
realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single
edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits
four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J>0$): a \textit{Kondo
phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and
the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to
$0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at
strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound
mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero
at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to
$0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J<0$): a local-moment (LM)
phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with
$S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at
intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at
strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet
develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic
understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the
fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for
antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by
boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots
occur for all $J<0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as
$J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound
modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this
phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free
energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and
found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact
diagonalization results.

Abstract: We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the
edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases
$\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment
$\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to
the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less
consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm
imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows
monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that
of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap
bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at
high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether
impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains
effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some
intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$.
These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment
phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation
towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the
local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond
conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity
contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.

Abstract: We compute the disorder averaged dc conductance in the non-equilibrium steady
state that sets in between a longer-range Kitaev chain and a metallic lead
connected to an external reservoir, as a function of the system parameters and
of the disorder strength. From our results, we map out the phase diagram of the
disordered chain for different types of disorder and discuss the corresponding
effects of the interplay between topology and disorder in the system. To do so,
we set up a combined analytical and numerical approach, which is potentially
amenable of straightforward generalizations to other disordered topological

Abstract: A diagrammatic formalism for lattices of 1/2 is developed. It is based on an
unconstrained mapping between spin and Majorana operators. This allows the use
of standard tools of diagrammatic quantum many-body theory without requiring

results obtained by computing the corrections up to second order for the
Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, showing that perturbative
corrections are not only numerically important, but also qualitatively improve
the results of mean-field theory. These results pave the way for the use of
Majorana diagrammatic tools in theoretical and numerical studies of quantum

Abstract: In topological materials, the planar Hall effect (PHE) is often regarded as a
hallmark of profound quantum phenomena-most notably the Adler-Bell-Jackiw
chiral anomaly and Berry curvature-rendering it an indispensable tool for
deciphering the topological essence of emergent phases. In this study, we delve
into the PHE and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the recently discovered
layered topological antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2. Our analysis of the robust PHE
signal (~3.8 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 2 K and 8 T) unveils a distinct interplay of
mechanisms. While Berry curvature plays a minor role, the dominant
contributions stem from classical orbital MR in the field-induced ferromagnetic
state and field-suppressed spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic regime. These
insights not only position EuAl2Si2-with its highly tunable spin texture-as an
exemplary system for probing the intricate coupling between spin configurations
and band topology in magnetotransport but also pave the way for designing novel
materials with tailored PHE responses, highlighting significant application
prospects in quantum sensing, spintronic devices, and topologically protected
electronic systems.

Abstract: We showed that a 2D depth map representing an incoherent 3D opaque scene is
directly encoded in the response function of an imaging optics. As a result,
the optics creates an image that depends nonlinearly on the depth map.
Furthermore, strong spatio-spectral dispersions in volume metaoptics can be
engineered to create a complex image in response to a depth map. We hypothesize
that this complexity will allow the linear volume metaoptics to nonlinearly
sense and process 3D opaque scenes.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A paper describes an ultra-precise method to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light beams, achieving a measurement precision of 2e-5, surpassing previous studies by three orders of magnitude. The method involves using laser speckle and microscopic spiral phase plates (SPPs) within microfluidic channels to measure the refractive index with shot-noise precision. This approach could be used to study biological samples like sucrose and haemoglobin, potentially for multiplexed measurements of spatio-temporal variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study likely aims to advance the measurement of OAM in optical systems, potentially for applications in optical manipulation, quantum information, and super-resolved imaging. High-precision measurements of OAM are crucial for validating theoretical predictions and optimizing practical implementations.

Method: The researchers generate Laguerre-Gaussian beams with varying OAM using mode conversion with SPPs. They measure the azimuthal index, l, of the beams using laser speckle patterns, which provides a way to quantify the OAM precisely. The refractive index of the medium around the SPP is measured with ultra-high precision, likely through interferometric methods, achieving shot-noise level accuracy.

Result: The researchers report a significant improvement in the precision of OAM measurements, achieving a resolution of 2e-5, which is orders of magnitude better than previous methods. Additionally, they demonstrate the feasibility of using microfluidic platforms to measure refractive indices with high precision, which could enable the development of miniaturized sensors for biological and physical applications.

Conclusion: The work paves the way for highly accurate and miniaturized refractive index sensors based on mode conversion, opening up possibilities for applications in optical communications, sensing, and biophysics. The ability to measure OAM with ultra-high precision opens new doors for both theoretical exploration and practical implementations in various optical-based technologies.

Abstract: Light beams possessing orbital angular momentum (OAM) have gained significant
interest in areas such as optical manipulation, quantum entanglement, and
super-resolved imaging. In itself, the OAM for a Laguerre-Gaussian beam is
proportional to the azimuthal index of the light field, $l$. It is in fact
continuous in nature and a non-trivial parameter to measure. The ability to
determine $l$ precisely would broaden the use of such beams for new
applications. In this study, we generate Laguerre-Gaussian beams of differing
$l$ through mode conversion using microscopic spiral phase plates (SPPs). The
exact value of $l$ imparted for a given incident wavelength is dependant upon
the refractive index of the media within which the SPP is immersed. Here, we
show an ultra-precise approach based on laser speckle to measure the azimuthal
index of these generated beams to a precision of $2\,{\times}\,10^{-5}$. This
is an improvement of three orders of magnitude over previous studies. In turn,
this leverages an ultra-precise measurement of the refractive index of the
medium surrounding the SPP, with a best measured precision of
$6.4\,{\times}\,10^{-7}$\,refractive index units. This is confirmed to be at
the shot-noise limit of the system. Our study interrogates samples of sucrose
and haemoglobin, only 300\,pL in volume, within a microfluidic channel. This
demonstration of an original form of microfluidic refractive index sensor,
based on mode conversion to light fields with OAM, may be multiplexed to
measure spatio-temporal variations and gradients within biological samples.

Result: 准束缚态的光解增强显著，且存在最佳偏移参数。

Conclusion: 研究为理解准束缚态 modal 质量和优化应用提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) exhibit extremely high quality factors
due to the lack of radiation loss and thus are widely studied for Purcell
enhancement. However, a closer examination reveals that the enhancement is
absent at the BIC due to the lack of out-coupling capability, but the strong
enhancement is only observed at nearby configuration, namely quasi-BIC. To
study this unique behavior of the Purcell enhancement near BIC, we built an
analytically model with spectral parameters to analyze the Purcell enhancement
on metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC. Our analytical model predicts the average
Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces coupled to a luminescent medium, utilizing
parameters that are formulated through the temporal coupled-mode theory and can
be derived from measured spectra such as transmissivity and reflectivity. We
analyzed several metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC numerically and
experimentally to study the behavior of the spectral parameters as well as the
resultant Purcell enhancement. We formulated the interdependence between the
quality factor and the out-coupling efficiency, and revealed the existence of
optimal detuning from the BIC. We also discovered that our findings are general
and applicable towards realistic metasurfaces that are lossy and/or asymmetric.
This discovery provides an intuitive model to understand the modal qualities of
quasi-BIC and will facilitate optimization of quasi-BIC for luminescence
enhancement applications.

Abstract: Mueller matrices (MMs) encode information on geometry and material
properties, but recovering both simultaneously is an ill-posed problem. We
explore whether MMs contain sufficient information to infer surface geometry
and material properties with machine learning. We use a dataset of spheres of
various isotropic materials, with MMs captured over the full angular domain at
five visible wavelengths (450-650 nm). We train machine learning models to
predict material properties and surface normals using only these MMs as input.
We demonstrate that, even when the material type is unknown, surface normals
can be predicted and object geometry reconstructed. Moreover, MMs allow models
to identify material types correctly. Further analyses show that diagonal
elements are key for material characterization, and off-diagonal elements are
decisive for normal estimation.

Abstract: The increase in demand for scalable and energy efficient artificial neural
networks has put the focus on novel hardware solutions. Integrated photonics
offers a compact, parallel and ultra-fast information processing platform,
specially suited for extreme learning machine (ELM) architectures. Here we
experimentally demonstrate a chip-scale photonic ELM based on wave chaos
interference in a stadium microcavity. By encoding the input information in the
wavelength of an external single-frequency tunable laser source, we leverage
the high sensitivity to wavelength of injection in such photonic resonators. We
fabricate the microcavity with direct laser writing of SU-8 polymer on glass. A
scattering wall surrounding the stadium operates as readout layer, collecting
the light associated with the cavity's leaky modes. We report uncorrelated and
aperiodic behavior in the speckles of the scattering barrier from a high
resolution scan of the input wavelength. Finally, we characterize the system's
performance at classification in four qualitatively different benchmark tasks.
As we can control the number of output nodes of our ELM by measuring different
parts of the scattering barrier, we demonstrate the capability to optimize our
photonic ELM's readout size to the performance required for each task.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A Fourier Feature Network significantly outperforms standard MLPs in modeling highly oscillatory optical fields with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of accurately modeling optical fields, which are inherently oscillatory, using deep learning techniques. Given the limitations of standard MLPs in capturing high-frequency oscillations, the authors propose incorporating Fourier features to overcome this limitation.

Method: The method involves modifying a standard feedforward neural network by adding Fourier feature inputs. These features, which are predefined sinusoids based on the perturbation parameters, allow the network to better approximate high-frequency components in the data. The learning problem is reframed as finding a linear combination of basis functions, which simplifies the optimization process.

Result: The proposed Fourier Feature Network demonstrates significant improvements over a standard MLP. The network achieves a mean complex correlation of 0.995 between the predicted and ground truth transmission matrices, while using 85% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: This work presents a novel and effective approach to modeling oscillatory physical systems. By leveraging Fourier features, the network not only enhances accuracy but also reduces computational complexity, making it a promising tool for a wide range of applications in optics and related fields.

Abstract: Modelling the effects of perturbations on optical fields often requires
learning highly oscillatory complex-valued functions. Standard multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) struggle with this task due to an inherent spectral bias,
preventing them from fitting high-frequency sinusoids. To overcome this, we
incorporate Fourier features - a set of predefined sinusoids dependent on the
perturbation - as an additional network input. This reframes the learning
problem from approximating a complex function to finding a linear combination
of basis functions. We demonstrate this method by training a Fourier Feature
Network to predict the transmission matrix of a multimode fibre under
mechanical compression. Compared to a standard MLP, our network reduces
prediction error in the output field's amplitude and phase by an order of
magnitude, achieving a mean complex correlation of 0.995 with the ground truth,
despite using 85% fewer parameters. This approach offers a general and robust
method for accurately modelling a wide class of oscillatory physical systems.

of excessive dispersion accumulation by gradually suppressing dispersion
through multi-stage design; (2) enhanced overall efficiency for
self-compression-based ultrashort blue pulse generation; and (3) elimination of

TL;DR: A single gadget can't achieve all polarization transformations on a Poincaré sphere but a combination of standard wave-plates can. This gadget allows transformations between any two points on the first-order Poincaré sphere but not on higher-order ones. We propose a new gadget where elements belong to two different polarization topological index spaces, enabling a mix of holonomic and non-holonomic transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of current polarization transformation gadgets and introduces a novel approach to overcome these limitations.

Method: The construction of a gadget using standard wave-plates and analysis of its polarization transformation capabilities, followed by the introduction of a new gadget with mixed holonomic and non-holonomic elements.

Result: The proposed gadget successfully enables polarization transformations between any two points on the first-order Poincaré sphere but fails on higher-order spheres. Additionally, a new gadget is introduced that combines holonomic and non-holonomic transformations.

Conclusion: While a single gadget can't achieve all polarization transformations, combining standard wave-plates and introducing a new gadget with mixed transformation properties significantly enhances the capabilities for these transformations.

Abstract: Designing a single element for all polarization transformations on a
Poincar\'e sphere is impossible due to practical limitations and hence a
combination of few standard wave-plates are used to construct a gadget. With
this gadget it is possible to realize a polarization transformation between any
two points on the Poincar\'e sphere. There is no such gadget available to
perform arbitrary polarization transformation on a higher order Poincar\'e
sphere. We present one gadget here in which the nature of polarization
transformations by its elements is a mixture of holonomic and non-holonomic,
since the elements belong to two different polarization topological index
spaces.

Abstract: Single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI) with intense short-wavelength
light pulses enables the structural characterization of individual
nanoparticles in free flight with high spatial and temporal resolution.
Conventional CDI assumes that the target object exhibits a linear scattering
response and static electronic properties. Here, we extend this approach to
investigate transient laser-driven modifications of the electronic structure in
individual nanoparticles, imprinted in their time-resolved diffraction
patterns. In the presence of a near-infrared laser pulse, we observe a
pronounced reduction in the diffraction signal from helium nanodroplets when
probed with ultrashort extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses. This effect is
attributed to a light-field-induced modification of the electronic structure of
the droplets, which substantially increases their XUV absorption. Our results
demonstrate that single-particle diffraction can capture ultrafast light-driven
electron dynamics in nanoscale systems. This paves the way for the
spatiotemporal tracking of reversible changes in the electronic properties of
nanoscale structures with potential applications in ultrafast X-ray optics,
materials science, and all-optical signal processing.

Abstract: Optical phased array (OPA) is a promising technology for compact, solid-state
beam steering, with applications ranging from free-space optical communication
to LiDAR. However, simultaneously achieving a large field of view (FOV), high
resolution, and low side-lobe level (SLL) remains a major challenge.
Traditional OPAs face inherent limitations: they exhibit grating lobes when
emitter spacing exceeds half the operating wavelength, while at half-wavelength
spacing, significant crosstalk issues persist. Previously, we demonstrated a
small-scale OPA that harnesses near-field interference and beamforming via a
trapezoidal slab grating and a half-wavelength-pitch waveguide array to achieve
a 180{\deg} FOV. However, its resolution was limited by the small channel
count. In this work, we present a 1000-channel OPA that scales this
architecture while addressing key challenges in waveguide crosstalk and control
complexity. By optimizing waveguide routing, we minimize inter-channel coupling
in the dense waveguide array. Additionally, we propose and demonstrate a

Abstract: Two-color X-ray imaging with Free Electron Laser pulses offers a powerful
approach for probing ultrafast structural dynamics in nanoscale systems,
combining (near-)atomic spatial resolution with femtosecond temporal precision.
The first X-ray pulse captures the object's initial state, while the
time-delayed second pulse records its subsequent evolution. A key challenge
lies in disentangling the two views simultaneously recorded by the same
detector. We demonstrate the realization of this approach on structurally
varying nanoscale particles using two X-ray pulses of different photon
energies, 1 and 1.2~keV. Sub-micrometer helium nanodroplets generated in vacuum
are irradiated by the two X-ray pulses separated in time by up to 750
femtoseconds. Taking advantage of the high energy sensitivity of the imaging
detector, we separate the overlapping images by analyzing individual pixel
counts and applying pattern recognition. The helium nanodroplets' spherical
shape allows us to cross-validate this approach by fitting the radial
scattering profiles with Mie solutions for a bichromatic field. The excellent
agreement between the two methods, particularly in the sparsely illuminated
outer regions of the diffraction images where fine structural information is
encoded, highlights the quality of this approach and its potential for future
advanced X-ray movie techniques.

### [59] [Near-optimal decomposition of unitary matrices using phase masks and the discrete Fourier transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20010)
*Vincent Girouard,Nicolás Quesada*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) are essential for optical state manipulation in classical and quantum info processing. While existing UMI architectures have limitations, recent approaches using phase masks and DFT matrices bypass these issues


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome design limitations of existing UMI architectures, recent work explores alternative methods that combine fixed multichannel mixing layers, phase masks, and DFT matrices for improved robustness. However, current design methods lack optimal analytical approaches to compute parameters efficiently. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a constructive decomposition method for unitary matrices using a sequence of phase masks and DFT matrices. The proposed decomposition provides an alternative analytical design approach, which could enhance the design and fabrication of UMIs compared to existing numerical optimization-based methods.

Method: The method involves decomposition of unitary matrices into a sequence of phase masks and DFT matrices, implemented through interferometric couplers. The specific sequence uses $2N+5$ phase masks and $2N+4$ DFT matrices to achieve the desired transformations.

Result: The decomposition method allows for analytical computation of design parameters with low optical depth, improving the efficiency and predictability of UMI designs. This analytical approach provides a systematic framework for synthesizing UMIs based on phase masks and multimode interference couplers, reducing reliance on numerical optimization and offering a more controlled design process.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel constructive decomposition method for designing universal interferometers using phase masks and DFT matrices, which offers an analytical alternative to numerical optimization-based design methods. This approach enhances the design of UMIs with improved robustness and predictability, opening new avenues for applications in optical information processing.

Abstract: Universal multiport interferometers (UMIs) have emerged as a key tool for
performing arbitrary linear transformations on optical modes, enabling precise
control over the state of light in essential applications of classical and
quantum information processing such as neural networks and boson sampling.
While UMI architectures based on Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks are well
established, alternative approaches that involve interleaving fixed
multichannel mixing layers and phase masks have recently gained interest due to
their high robustness to losses and fabrication errors. However, these
approaches currently lack optimal analytical methods to compute design
parameters with low optical depth. In this work, we introduce a constructive
decomposition of unitary matrices using a sequence of $2N+5$ phase masks
interleaved with $2N+4$ discrete Fourier transform matrices. This decomposition
can be leveraged to design universal interferometers based on phase masks and
multimode interference couplers, implementing a discrete Fourier transform,
offering an analytical alternative to conventional numerical optimization-based
designs.

Motivation: The authors likely aimed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of mode-sorting techniques by integrating neural network-based methods.

Result: The proposed method achieved higher efficiency compared to traditional mode-sorting methods under the same crosstalk conditions.

Conclusion: The integration of output detection regions into the trainable parameters of a diffractive optical neural network enhances the performance of mode-sorting systems.

Abstract: Mode-sorting is a procedure that decomposes a light field into a basis of
transverse modes, directing each mode into a separate spatial location,
allowing the constituent mode intensities to be measured simultaneously. We
demonstrate a mode-sorter based on a diffractive optical neural network and
show that it is advantageous to include the output detection regions into the
trainable set of parameters of that network. This approach outperforms
traditional mode-sorting methods, achieving higher efficiency for the same
crosstalk levels.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子计算代表了量子力学在信息处理方面的一项重大技术进步，但当前的NISQ设备（ noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices）面临硬件限制，如有限的量子位数、高错误率和较短相干时间。如何高效管理和分配量子资源，无论是物理上的还是逻辑上的，对设计和部署量子算法都至关重要。本文分析了NISQ设备当前的多种使用场景，探讨了它们在软件工程中的作用，提出了对量子软件开发的看法。我们提出了一种基于时序意识的量子软件开发框架Qonscious，实现基于动态资源评估的量子程序条件执行，以增强量子资源估计（QRE）领域的发展和可扩展性、可靠性和资源化量子软件的开发。

Abstract: Quantum computers represent a radical technological advancement in the way
information is processed by using the principles of quantum mechanics to solve
very complex problems that exceed the capabilities of classical systems.
However, in the current NISQ era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices),
the available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number
of qubits, high error rates, and reduced coherence times. Efficient management
of quantum resources, both physical (qubits, error rates, connectivity) and
logical (quantum gates, algorithms, error correction), becomes particularly
relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this work, we
analyze the role of resources in the various uses of NISQ devices today,
identifying their relevance and implications for software engineering focused
on the use of quantum computers. We propose a vision for runtime-aware quantum
software development, identifying key challenges to its realization, such as
limited introspection capabilities and temporal constraints in current
platforms. As a proof of concept, we introduce Qonscious, a prototype framework
that enables conditional execution of quantum programs based on dynamic
resource evaluation. With this contribution, we aim to strengthen the field of
Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move towards the development of scalable,
reliable, and resource-aware quantum software.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A method for quantum process tomography (QPT) of multi-level qudits is presented, validated on a room-temperature ^{87}Rb vapor ensemble. The approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians, providing a computationally efficient framework for characterizing open quantum systems, benchmarking quantum sensors, and identifying environmental noise correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a fundamental tool for understanding the dynamics of open quantum systems, but its application to multi-level qudits presents significant experimental challenges, particularly in room-temperature systems. This work addresses these challenges and demonstrates a practical approach for QPT in such systems.

Method: The authors propose and experimentally validate a QPT method specifically designed for room-temperature ^{87}Rb vapor ensembles. This method enables the high-fidelity reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians and provides a computationally efficient framework for analyzing open quantum systems.

Result: The experimental results confirm the feasibility and high-fidelity nature of the proposed QPT method. The reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians validates the approach for studying non-unitary dynamics, benchmarking quantum sensors, and identifying environmental noise correlations in multi-level quantum systems.

Conclusion: This work overcomes significant experimental limitations of QPT in multi-level qudits and provides a practical, efficient tool for quantum system characterization. The results demonstrate the potential of the method for advancing quantum technology applications, such as quantum sensing and noise analysis.

Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a technique for reconstructing the
dynamics of open quantum systems under the Born-Markov approximation, as
described by a Liouvillian superoperator, capturing both coherent and
dissipative processes. While QPT is well established for qubits, it presents
significant experimental challenges in multi-level qudits. In room-temperature
atomic vapors, these difficulties arise from complex interactions, residual
fields present in the system, environmental noise, and inhomogeneities in the
medium. Overcoming these limitations is essential for accurate modeling and
precise control of such systems--a critical step toward practical usage of the
QPT. We present a QPT method that we experimentally validate on a
room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor ensemble, achieving high-fidelity
reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians. Our approach establishes a
computationally efficient framework for characterizing open quantum systems,
enabling the study of non-unitary dynamics, efficient benchmarking of quantum
sensors, and data-driven identification of environmental noise correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文旨在通过随机过程提供一种新的框架来统一所有基本相互作用，这在当前物理学中是一个高度活跃的研究领域。随机过程在量子力学中的应用已有大量研究，但尚未广泛应用于统一场论中。该研究的目标是itation发现一种普适的方法，能够将复杂相互作用统一在一个简洁的框架内。

Method: 该方法基于经典随机过程，其中涉及有限速度和概率反转。先前的工作，如Nelson和Kac的研究，表明可以利用古典随机过程来推导出量子力学的关键方程，如Schr"{o}dinger方程、Dirac方程以及Born规则。此外，该方法还引入了基本长度标度，以获得在常规场论中常见的问题，如无限大的消除。

Result: 该研究的结果表明，该随机过程方法能够量子化经典电磁力和线性引力。此外，通过推广Riemanm-Silberstein向量，该方法还可以描述非阿贝尔规范场，而不依赖于对称性。同时，编码理论能够与离散空间中的测地网络相结合，从而构建了包括物质和几 何在内的统一框架。在大型极限下，该模型能够恢复熟悉 的量子场行为，而在线粒体层面上保持了有限性和无背景依赖性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于随机过程的方法，用于统一所有基本相互作用。通过引入基本长度标度，该方法消除了常规场论中常见的无限大问题，并使其在大尺度极限下恢复熟悉 的量子场行为。此外，该方法不仅适用于经典电磁力和线性引力，还可以扩展以描述非阿贝尔规范场，而不依赖于对称性。编码理论和离散化空间的结合为统一场论提供了新的框架。可以认为，该研究为量子力学和物理学中的统一理论提供了一种新颖的路径，其基础在于物理随机性而非量子化规则。文中指出，在大尺度极限下，系统的平衡态类似引力中的韦尔-德威尔约束，进一步增强了该理论作为量子引力和统一的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a new perspective on unifying all fundamental
interactions--gravitational, electromagnetic, weak and strong--based on
stochastic processes rather than conventional quantum mechanics. Earlier work
by Nelson, Kac and others have established that key quantum features such as
the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations together with the Born rule can be
derived from classical random processes involving finite speeds and
probabilistic reversals. A fundamental length scale, inherent for dimensional
consistency, regularizes the infinities that typically plague conventional
field theories. The method can be used to quantize electrodynamics as well as
linear gravity, using the Riemann-Silberstein vector and its generalization.
  To include fields beyond electromagnetism, the Riemann-Silberstein vector can
be generalized to describe non-Abelian gauge fields without relying on gauge
symmetry. These fields can be coupled to spin networks--geometric structures
that discretize space--leading to a unified framework that includes both matter
and geometrty. In the large-scale limit, the model reproduces familiar quantum
field behaviour, while remaining finite and background-independent at the
fundamental level. The emergence of equilibrium states resembling
Wheeler-DeWill constraints in gravity adds further depth, suggesting a novel
route to quantum gravity and unification grounded in physical stochasticity
rather than quantization rules.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum mechanics has remained conceptually puzzling since its inception.
While its mathematical formalism provides predictions of unparalleled accuracy,
the interpretative framework underpinning measurement and collapse has never
been fully clarified. The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the
wavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent
phenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification
and record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse
within the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics.
The theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the
record asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order
parameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus
characterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with
thresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This
perspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and
spatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type
violations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action
at a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the
conversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete,
irreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp
threshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a
critical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical
cavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference
fringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time.
If confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of
thermodynamic processes, removing the last "mystical" postulate from quantum
theory.

Result: 研究成功将因果特征选择用于量子机器学习，结果提升了平均11.3%模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子基础与因果AI提供新视角，推动量子计算与机器学习结合。

Abstract: Bell's theorem reveals a profound conflict between quantum mechanics and
local realism, a conflict we reinterpret through the modern lens of causal
inference. We propose and computationally validate a framework where quantum
entanglement acts as a "super-confounding" resource, generating correlations
that violate the classical causal bounds set by Bell's inequalities. This work
makes three key contributions: First, we establish a physical hierarchy of
confounding (Quantum > Classical) and introduce Confounding Strength (CS) to
quantify this effect. Second, we provide a circuit-based implementation of the
quantum $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus to distinguish causality from spurious
correlation. Finally, we apply this calculus to a quantum machine learning
problem, where causal feature selection yields a statistically significant
11.3% average absolute improvement in model robustness. Our framework bridges
quantum foundations and causal AI, offering a new, practical perspective on
quantum correlations.

Conclusion: 该研究为评估成像传感器的量子噪声极限提供了一种紧凑且物理直观的方法。

Abstract: The optogeometric factor, recently introduced as a pixel level form of
\'etendue, quantifies the spatial angular throughput of a detector element. In
this work its interpretation is extended by identifying optogeometric factor
with the number of accessible optical modes per pixel. This mode based
perspective establishes a direct link between radiometric throughput and
quantum photon statistics.
  By combining optogeometric factor with the Bose Einstein distribution, an
estimate of the lowest achievable signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the pixel
level is derived.
  Explicit formulas are presented in both scene-based and sensor based forms,
showing how the minimal SNR depends on aperture geometry, pixel pitch,
f-number, wavelength, and source temperature. This formulation provides a
compact and physically transparent benchmark for evaluating imaging sensors
against the lowest expected quantum noise limit.

Abstract: The optimization of the conversion of thermal energy into work and the
minimization of dissipation for nano- and mesoscopic systems is a complex
challenge because of the important role fluctuations play on the dynamics of
small systems. We generalize the work of Esposito et al. EPL 89, 20003 (2010)
to optimize at all driving speeds the control needed to extract the maximum
amount of work from any effective two-level systems. These emerge when one
coarse-grains degrees of freedom, which is often unavoidable to obtain
"real-world" two-level systems. In particular, we allow even for the system to
have underlying quantum dynamics, as long as these allow for a coarse-graining
that leads to a Markovian master equation. We analyze the finite-time
thermodynamics of these systems and find the thermodynamically optimal
protocols, which depend on the size of the coarse-graining needed to obtain a
two-level system. Furthermore, we use these results to derive speed-limits for
any transformation performed on an effective two-level system.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We provide a simulation algorithm that properly addresses light matter
interaction between non-relativistic first-quantized charged particles and
quantum electromagnetic fields. Unlike previous work, our Hamiltonian does not
include an explicit Coulomb interaction between particles. Rather, the Coulomb
interaction emerges from the imposition of Gauss' law as a constraint upon the
system in an appropriate non-relativistic limit. Furthermore, a form of
topological protection emerges in our formalism, analogous to that of the Toric
code Hamiltonian. This mechanism prevents simulation-induced electric field
errors that can be contracted to a point from causing any deviations from
Coulomb's law in the non-relativistic limit and any error that forms a
non-contractable loop is energetically dissallowed in the limit of large
volume. We find that, under appropriate continuity assumptions, the number of
non-Clifford gates required by our algorithm scales in the thermodynamic limit
as $\widetilde{O}(N^{2/3}\eta^{4/3} t \log^5(1/\epsilon))$ for $\eta$
particles, $N$ spatial grid points, simulation time $t$ and error tolerance
$\epsilon$. In comparison, the more specific problem of simulating the Coulomb
interaction scales as $\widetilde{O}(N^{1/3} \eta^{8/3} t \log^2(1/\epsilon))$.
This suggests that if $N \in \tilde{o}(\eta^4)$ that our non-relativistic
electrodynamic simulation method could provide a computational advantage for
electronic structure problems in the thermodynamic limit under appropriate
continuity assumptions as it obviates the need to compute the $O(\eta^2)$
pairwise interactions in the Coulomb Hamiltonian.

Abstract: In this work, we develop an optimal control theory on open quantum system and

non-Condon photo-induced electron transfer (PET) in condensed phase. This
method utilizes the dissipaton theory, proposed by Yan in 2014 for open quantum
systems, which provides an exact description of the dissipative system while
also enables rigorous characterization and control of environmental
hybridization modes, fully taking into account the non-perturbative and
non-Markovian effects. Leveraging the advantage of the dissipaton phase-space
algebra, we present in this communication the theoretical strategy for optimal
control on both system and environment simultaneously. The control protocol is
successfully demonstrated on PET for the environment-targeted-control
facilitated transfer. This work sheds the light on manipulating open systems

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  Bradley examines whether the Bloch theorem applies to macroscopic crystals, but finds that electrons in a realistic periodic potential form an open quantum system due to decoherence and dissipation, and revises the Ovchinnikov and Erikhman theory of decoherence, calculating the effective interaction distance before ion incoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on revisiting the Ovchinnikov and Erikhman theory of decoherence, which is of significant importance in understanding electron behavior in macroscopic crystals.

Method:  Bradley modifies the original theory, recalculates conditions for decoherence, and determines the length scale up to which the ion motion remains coherent.

Result: The findings reveal a new length scale up to which effective quantum coherence is maintained in electrons within a crystal structure.

Conclusion: The research extends the original model and provides a deeper understanding of decoherence effects in crystal electron systems, with potential implications for quantum theory in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: In solid state physics, it is an unsaid (tacit) assumption that the Bloch
theorem is applicable to a crystal lattice even if it is of the macroscopic
dimensions, provided periodicity is maintained. However, in a realistic
situation, electrons in a periodic potential of ions constitute an open quantum
system and are subjected to decoherence and dissipation. A natural question
arises: up to what distances electrons in a periodic potential can be
considered as constituting an effective closed quantum system? And what is the
cause of decoherence? To answer some of these questions, the seminal theory of
Ovchinnikov and Erikhman of decoherence due to ionic motion is revisited and an
oversight of the authors is corrected. Correct conditions for decoherence to
occur are worked out. Length scale up to which the motion of ions remains
coherent is also calculated. Finally, a realistic physical picture is
discussed.

Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of quantum systems, particularly in scenarios with time-dependent parameters, is driven by both fundamental physics and potential applications in quantum information technologies.

Method: The researchers derive an analytical solution for the resonant time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings model, analyzing the system's behavior using the Bloch vector.

Result: The model demonstrates periodic behavior in the system's dynamics, showing phenomena such as atomic population trapping when the initial thermal photon number is increased.

Conclusion: This work provides analytical insights into the dynamics of a time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings model, contributing to the understanding of quantum systems with modulated couplings and offering potential applications in quantum technology research.

Abstract: The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model stands as a fully quantized, fundamental
framework for exploring light-matter interactions, a timely reflection on a
century of quantum theory. The time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (TDJC) model
introduces temporal variations in certain parameters, which often require
numerical methods. However, under the resonance condition, exact solutions can
be obtained, offering insight into a variety of physical scenarios. In this
work, we study the resonant TDJC model considering different modulations of the
atom-field coupling. The model is presented and an analytical solution derived
in a didactic way, allowing us to examine how time-dependent couplings affect
atomic population inversion and atom-field entanglement. We also consider an
atom traversing a partially cooled cavity, which induces periodicity and
reveals the combined effects of atomic motion and thermal fluctuations. The
Bloch vector is used to analyze the dynamics of the system, including the
atomic state purity, and reveals phenomena such as atomic dipole alignment with
the field due to the oscillating coupling, as well as atomic population
trapping, which arises by increasing the initial mean thermal photon number.

interactions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the
Color Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in
the hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then,
we are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising
interactions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that
condensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase
transition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types
of anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric
Code where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it
a partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above
results is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in
the sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising
models, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze
behavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological
order. We introduce three string order parameters that can well characterize
different phases of the model. Specifically we give a simple description of the
partially condensed phase by using string order parameters.

Abstract: The importance of analyzing nontrivial datasets when testing quantum machine
learning (QML) models is becoming increasingly prominent in literature, yet a
cohesive framework for understanding dataset characteristics remains elusive.
In this work, we concentrate on the size of the dataset as an indicator of its
complexity and explores the potential for QML models to demonstrate superior
data-efficiency compared to classical models, particularly through the lens of
quantum kernel methods (QKMs). We provide a method for generating
semi-artificial fully classical datasets, on which we show one of the first
evidence of the existence of classical datasets where QKMs require less data
during training. Additionally, our study introduces a new analytical tool to
the QML domain, derived for classical kernel methods, which can be aimed at
investigating the classical-quantum gap. Our empirical results reveal that QKMs
can achieve low error rates with less training data compared to classical
counterparts. Furthermore, our method allows for the generation of datasets
with varying properties, facilitating further investigation into the
characteristics of real-world datasets that may be particularly advantageous
for QKMs. We also show that the predicted performance from the analytical tool
we propose - a generalization metric from classical domain - show great
alignment empirical evidence, which fills the gap previously existing in the
field. We pave a way to a comprehensive exploration of dataset complexities,
providing insights into how these complexities influence QML performance
relative to traditional methods. This research contributes to a deeper
understanding of the generalization benefits of QKM models and potentially a
broader family of QML models, setting the stage for future advancements in the
field.

### [74] [Microscopic Origin of Domain Wall Reconfiguration Dynamics in a Quantum Material via Quantum Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20028)
*Jaka Vodeb*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates the relaxation of quantum materials from metastable states using quantum simulation. In 1T-TaS2, domain walls reconfigure via single-polaron tunneling events, and temperature scaling confirms their dominance over multi-particle transitions. A two-dimensional TFIM is mapped to a hardcore boson model, revealing that the reconfiguration rates collapse when temperature is scaled with a power-law relation. This provides a deeper understanding of how quantum materials evolve out of equilibrium and highlights the utility of quantum simulation in studying strongly correlated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamics of quantum materials under nonequilibrium conditions is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. This paper addresses how metastable states in layered dichalcogenides relax through reconfiguration events that exhibit different temperature dependencies, indicating quantum tunneling effects. By employing quantum simulation, the authors aim to uncover the microscopic processes underlying these complex dynamics.

Method: The study employs a quantum simulation of a two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias. A Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is used to map the model to a hardcore boson model, allowing the identification of single-polaron tunneling events as the dominant mechanism for domain wall motion. The reconfiguration rates across varying transverse fields are analyzed for scaling behavior, confirming the dominance of first- and second-order single-particle processes.

Result: The key finding is that single-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle tunneling, dominate the motion of domain walls in 1T-TaS2. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration rates shows that when temperature is rescaled as T → h_x^n T with n ≈ 1.2, the collapse of reconfiguration rates suggests a dominance of first- and second-order single-particle processes. This provides a clear mechanism for how quantum materials relax from metastable states under nonequilibrium conditions, highlighting the importance of understanding individual particle tunneling events in the evolution of quantum states in strongly correlated systems.

Conclusion: This work establishes a framework for using quantum simulation to study the real-space dynamics of quantum materials under nonequilibrium conditions. By demonstrating that single-polaron tunneling events dominate domain wall motion and providing a scaling relation for temperature dependence, the study bridges the gap between effective spin models and the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials, opening new avenues for understanding complex quantum behavior in strongly correlated systems.

Abstract: Understanding how quantum materials relax from metastable states poses a
fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. In the layered
dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a
uniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover
from thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of
quantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the
microscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff
transformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that
single-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle
transitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration
rates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is
rescaled as $T \to h_x^n T$ with $n \approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of
first- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to
reconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron
leakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum
simulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly
correlated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective
spin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials.

Photons are the natural carrier of information in quantum networks, but the

Abstract: A theory is proposed for the component of the Casimir-like force that arises
between bodies embedded in a macroscopic quantum damped oscillator. When the
oscillator's parameters depend on the distance between the bodies, the
oscillator-induced Casimir-like force is generally determined by a broad
spectral range extending to high frequencies, limited by the frequency
dispersion of the damping function. Here it is shown that there is a large
class of systems in which the low-frequency range dominates the forces. This
allows for the use of the Ohmic approximation, which is crucial for extending
the theory to the lumped element description of fluctuation-induced forces in
electrical circuits. Estimates of the circuit-induced Casimir-Lifshitz force
suggest that under certain conditions it can be identified experimentally due
to its dependence on various circuit elements.

Abstract: Linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) connects the general
linear non-unitary dynamics with unitary operators and serves as the
mathematical backbone of designing near-optimal quantum linear differential
equation algorithms. However, the existing LCHS formalism needs to find a
kernel function subject to complicated technical conditions on a half complex
plane. In this work, we establish an alternative formalism of LCHS based on the
Fourier transform. Our new formalism completely removes the technical
requirements beyond the real axis, providing a simple and flexible way of
constructing LCHS kernel functions. Specifically, we construct a different
family of the LCHS kernel function, providing a $1.81$ times reduction in the
quantum differential equation algorithms based on LCHS, and an $8.27$ times
reduction in its quantum circuit depth at a truncation error of $\epsilon \le
10^{-8}$. Additionally, we extend the scope of the LCHS formula to the scenario
of simulating linear unstable dynamics for a short or intermediate time period.

TL;DR: Quantum sensors with off-resonant detuning demonstrate super-linear sensitivity enhancement through a dissipative quantum phase transition in the strong-coupling regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum sensor performance by reducing resource requirements and measurement complexity.

Method: Investigated a driven Jaynes-Cummings system under dissipation, analyzing sensitivity enhancement through detuning and strong-coupling dynamics.

Result: Enhanced sensitivity scales super-linearly with the strong-coupling regime ratio, achievable with homodyne detection and Bayesian estimation.

Conclusion: Efficient quantum sensor operation with partial system accessibility and minimal resource investment maintained high sensitivity approaching theoretical limits.

Abstract: Quantum sensors are powerful devices that exploit quantum effects to detect
minute quantities with extremely high precision. Two obstacles to harnessing
the full capacity of quantum probes are the resource-intensive preparation of
the probe and the need for sophisticated measurements that typically require
full access to the entire probe. Here, we address these challenges by
investigating the driven Jaynes-Cummings system undergoing a dissipative
quantum phase transition as a quantum sensor. We show that detuning the system
off resonance significantly improves sensing performance by adequately
selecting a preferred bistable state in phase space. Our dissipative sensor,
independent of the initial probe preparation, exhibits a super-linear
enhancement in sensitivity with respect to a specific sensing resource -- the
strong-coupling regime ratio -- which manifests in both the full system and
partial subsystem. Hence, quantum-enhanced sensitivity persists even when only
partial system accessibility is available. Remarkably, we show that a homodyne
detection of the field state, combined with Bayesian estimation, nearly
saturates the ultimate sensitivity limit of the entire system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to minimize the number of experimental settings required for quantum process characterization, particularly in large-scale quantum systems.

Method: The approach uses two mutually unbiased bases to compute lower and upper bounds and reconstruct the processes, achieving system-size independence and efficient error mitigation.

Result: The method validates with photonic fusion and controlled-NOT operations, achieving accurate resource estimation with drastically fewer experimental settings than previous methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method is suitable for estimating quantum gate properties in various quantum architectures, offering a practical solution for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: Characterizing quantum dynamics is essential for quantifying arbitrary
properties of a quantum process -- such as its ability to exhibit
quantum-mechanical dynamics or generate entanglement. However, current methods
require a number of experimental settings that increases with system size,
leading to artifacts from experimental errors. Here, we propose an approximate
optimization method that estimates property measures using only two mutually
unbiased bases to compute their lower and upper bounds, and to reconstruct the
corresponding processes. This system-size independence prevents error
accumulation and allows characterization of the intrinsic quantum dynamics.
Compared with quantum process tomography, we experimentally validate our method
on photonic fusion and controlled-NOT operations, demonstrating accurate
resource estimation while substantially reducing the number of required Pauli
experimental settings: from 81 to 10 for the photonic fusion and to 2 for the
controlled-NOT. These results show that our method is well-suited for
estimation of dynamical properties in architectures ranging from chip-scale
quantum processors to long-distance quantum networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The efficient preparation of collective eigenstates of subwavelength-spaced
optical dipoles is a prerequisite for observing their signature radiative
properties and for their applications in quantum information processing. We
theoretically investigate the deterministic preparation of superradiant and
subradiant states of two dipole-coupled two-level quantum emitters at
deep-subwavelength separation using the Swing-UP of Quantum Emitter Population
(SUPER) excitation scheme. Utilizing suitable pulse parameters for two
red-detuned, time-overlapping Gaussian pulses, the SUPER scheme enables
close-to-unity population inversion in the targeted collective eigenstates.
Furthermore, a tunable optical phase in the SUPER scheme enables the
simultaneous inversions in both pure super- and subradiant states with finite
populations, thereby resulting in the preparation of hybrid collective states.
These results are possible to realize with or without an optical cavity. Our
approach to populating the collective eigenstates in a cavity environment paves
the way for the efficient preparation of these states in the presence of
environmental decoherence. Our scheme enables single-photon generation, which
is measured using the second-order correlation function. We also discuss in
detail possible experimental realizations, in particular using solid-state
emitters and molecules.

Abstract: A pair of Hermitian operators is canonical if they satisfy the canonical
commutation relation. It has been believed that no such canonical pair exists
in finite-dimensional Hilbert space. Here, we obtain canonical pairs by noting
that the canonical commutation relation holds in a proper subspace of the
Hilbert space. For a given Hilbert space, we study the many possible canonical
pairs and look into the uncertainty relation they satisfy. We apply our results
by constructing time operators in finite-dimensional quantum mechanics.

Motivation: Low-cost, room-T, noise-optimized MIR imaging for bio-imaging applications.

Method: Cavity-enhanced SPDC to up-convert down-converted photons to high-energy MIR.

Result: Efficient single-photon detection on Si-SPADs achieves high-contrast, label-free imaging.

Conclusion: Enables scalable quantum-enabled MIR imaging for diagnostics and research.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range provides
unique molecular specificity by probing fundamental vibrational modes of
molecular bonds, making it highly valuable for biomedical and biochemical
applications. However, conventional MIR imaging techniques often rely on
high-intensity illumination that can induce photodamage in sensitive biological
tissues. Single-photon MIR imaging offers a label-free, non-invasive
alternative, yet its adoption is hindered by the lack of efficient,
room-temperature MIR single-photon detectors. We present a single-photon
hyperspectral imaging platform that combines cavity-enhanced spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with nonlinear frequency up-conversion. This
approach enables MIR spectral imaging using cost-effective, visible-wavelength
silicon single-photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs), supporting room-temperature,
low-noise, and high-efficiency operation. Time-correlated photon pairs
generated via SPDC suppress classical intensity noise, enabling near
shot-noise-limited hyperspectral imaging. We demonstrate chemically specific
single-photon imaging across the \SIrange{2.9}{3.6}{\micro\meter} range on
biological (egg yolk, yeast) and polymeric (polystyrene, polyethylene) samples.
The system delivers high-contrast, label-free imaging at ultralow photon flux,
overcoming key limitations of current MIR technologies. This platform paves the
way toward scalable, quantum-enabled MIR imaging for applications in molecular
diagnostics, environmental sensing, and biomedical research.

required by the deterministic Grover's algorithm (the one based on generalized
Householder reflections). We use various semiempirical methods to show that the
interval of number of iterations for which the algorithm keeps the probability
of finding solution high depends on the register size and the oracle phases.

Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental scheme for high-precision position
measurements based on transverse-momentum-resolved two-photon interferometry
with independent photons and SPAD arrays. Our scheme extends the operative
range of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry beyond its intrinsic constraints due to
photons indistinguishability, paving the way to applications in high-resolution
imaging. We assess the experimental results against the ultimate precision
bounds as determined by quantum estimation theory. Our experiment ultimately
proves that transverse-momentum resolved measurements of fourth-order
correlations in the fields can be employed to overcome spatial
distiguishability between independent photons. The relevance of our results
extends beyond sensing and imaging towards quantum information processing, as
we show that partial photon distinguishability and entanglement impurity are
not necessarily a nuisance in a technique that relies on two-photon
interference.

TL;DR: Quantum non-Gaussianity is a key resource for quantum advantage in continuous-variable systems. The paper introduces a general framework to quantify non-Gaussianity based on correlation generation. Two copies of a state become correlated at a 50:50 beam splitter if and only if the state is non-Gaussian, with correlations reducing to entanglement in the pure-state case. The paper defines operational measures of non-Gaussianity through correlation quantifiers such as Rényi-α entropy for pure states and Rényi-α mutual information for mixed states. It proves that all such measures are monotonic under Gaussian channels. The paper proposes a sample-efficient experimental protocol to estimate non-Gaussianity using standard optical components, even in the state-agnostic setting. The paper establishes a lower bound on the sample complexity of estimating Wigner negativity, allowing a direct comparison with their protocol. The results provide both a unifying theoretical framework for non-Gaussianity and a practical route toward its experimental quantification.

Motivation: The paper focuses on the quantification of non-Gaussianity in continuous-variable quantum systems, a critical resource for quantum advantage. It introduces a framework linking non-Gaussianity to correlations at a 50:50 beam splitter, providing a unified approach that can be applied to both pure and mixed states. The operational measures based on Rényi-α entropy and mutual information offer practical tools for assessing non-Gaussianity. The paper's contribution is both theoretical, offering a unifying framework, and practical, providing a protocol for experimental quantification.

Method: The paper employs mathematical formalism to define non-Gaussianity via correlations at a 50:50 beam splitter. It uses information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi-α entropy and mutual information, to quantify these correlations. The authors prove the monotonicity of these measures under Gaussian channels, ensuring their utility in practical applications. The experimental protocol is designed using standard optical components, making it accessible for implementation.

Result: The paper successfully establishes a framework for quantifying non-Gaussianity in quantum systems. It provides a practical method for estimating this resource using standard optical equipment in a state-agnostic setting. The paper also determines a lower bound for estimating Wigner negativity, allowing for a direct comparison with their proposed protocol. These results advance both the theoretical understanding and practical implementation of non-Gaussianity quantification.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive and practical approach to quantifying non-Gaussianity in quantum systems. By linking non-Gaussianity to correlations at a 50:50 beam splitter and providing operational measures based on well-known information-theoretic quantities, the paper offers a clear pathway for both theoretical exploration and experimental implementation. The establishment of a lower bound for Wigner negativity estimation further enhances the practical relevance of the work by providing a benchmark for experimental protocols.

Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussianity is a key resource for quantum advantage in
continuous-variable systems. We introduce a general framework to quantify
non-Gaussianity based on correlation generation: two copies of a state become
correlated at a $50{:}50$ beam splitter if and only if the state is
non-Gaussian, with correlations reducing to entanglement in the pure-state
case. This connection enables operational measures of non-Gaussianity, defined
through correlation quantifiers such as R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy for pure
states and R\'enyi-$\alpha$ mutual information for mixed states. We prove that
all such measures are monotonic under Gaussian channels. Building on this
framework, we propose a sample-efficient experimental protocol to estimate
non-Gaussianity using standard optical components, even in the state agnostic
setting. Finally, we establish a lower bound on the sample complexity of
estimating Wigner negativity, allowing a direct comparison with our protocol.
Our results provide both a unifying theoretical framework for non-Gaussianity
and a practical route toward its experimental quantification.

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum algorithm for detecting torsion in simplicial complexes, showing potential exponential speedup over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of quantum computing in topological data analysis (TDA) has led researchers to explore how quantum algorithms can leverage topological features beyond Betti numbers, such as torsion.

Method: The authors developed a quantum algorithm that takes torsion information from a classical Wilson matrix, using a low-complexity classical procedure as an oracle. This constructs a quantum circuit encoding relevant information and applies amplitude amplification to amplify the correct answers.

Result: The algorithm succeeds with high probability and offers exponential speedup in detecting torsion, a feature not yet fully explored in quantum TDA.

Conclusion: This work expands the potential of quantum computing in TDA by addressing a novel aspect of topology, opening new avenues for research in both fields.

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) has become an attractive area for the
application of quantum computing. Recent advances have uncovered many
interesting connections between the two fields. On one hand, complexity
theoretic results show that estimating Betti numbers, a central task in TDA, is
NP hard, indicating that a generic quantum speedup is unlikely. On the other
hand, several recent studies have explored structured, less generic settings
and demonstrated that quantum algorithms can still achieve significant speedups
under certain conditions. To date, most of these efforts have focused on Betti
numbers, which are topological invariants capturing the intrinsic connectivity
and holes in a dataset. However, there is another important feature of
topological spaces: torsion. Torsion represents a distinct component of
homology that can reveal richer structural information. In this work, we
introduce a quantum algorithm for torsion detection, that is, determining
whether a given simplicial complex contains torsion. Our algorithm, assisted by
a low complexity classical procedure, can succeed with high probability and
potentially offer exponential speedup over the classical counterpart.

Motivation: Understanding the limitations of simulating open quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum computing and condensed matter physics.

Method: The study employs quantum and classical tensor network simulations to analyze the scaling of computational complexity with dissipation and system size.

Result: Classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, indicating a clear separation between quantum and classical resource scaling for open quantum system simulations.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the inherent challenges in simulating open quantum systems, emphasizing the need for further theoretical and technological advancements.

Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium
processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and
can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed
the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the
intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the
computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two
physically relevant parameters, correlation length and mixing time, and explore
whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed
counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating
open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the
classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator
entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation
length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales.
Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations,
classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a
separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.

Motivation: 量子信息处理中，离子陷阱的局部模式之间的纠缠调控是一个关键问题，尤其是需要有效地实现量子纠错和模拟。

Method: 通过动态可调谐振器和 beamsplitter 方法，能够对相邻离子陷阱模式进行精确调控。

Result: 该方法通过数学推导和数值模拟验证了其有效性，提供了新的量子调控技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为量子信息处理中的纠缠调控问题提供突破性解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum information processing using local modes of trapped ions has been
applied to implementing bosonic quantum error correction codes and conducting
efficient quantum simulation of bosonic systems. However, control of
entanglement among local modes remains difficult because entaglement among
resonant local modes is governed by the Coulomb interaction, which is not
switchable. We propose a method of a beamsplitter for a trapped-ion
architecture, where the secular frequency of each mode is dynamically
controllable. The neighboring modes are far detuned except when the
beamsplitter needs to be applied to them. We derive the analytical formula of
the proposed procedure and numerically confirm its validity.

Abstract: We investigate the realization of non-singular bouncing cosmologies driven by
causal bulk-viscous fluids within General Relativity, $f(R)$ gravity, and Loop
Quantum Cosmology. Building on the no-go result of Eckart theory in spatially
flat universes, we show that the Israel--Stewart formulation, which
incorporates finite relaxation times, permits controlled violations of the null
energy condition at the bounce while remaining consistent with thermodynamic
and causality requirements. Analytical bounce solutions are constructed from
parametrized scale factors, yielding explicit constraints on the viscosity
coefficient and relaxation time that guarantee positive entropy production and
stable perturbations. In extended gravity frameworks, we demonstrate that
higher-curvature corrections in $f(R)$ models and quantum geometry effects in
Loop Quantum Cosmology further enhance the robustness of viscous bounces. Our
results establish a unified description in which bulk viscosity provides a
physically consistent mechanism for singularity resolution across different
theories of gravity, highlighting distinctive conditions under which smooth
cosmological bounces can occur.

Result: 在 O3 数据基础上，相比 LVK 测量精度提升30%。预期在 O4 和 O5 观测中，分别达到20%和2.7%的 Hubble constant 测量精度。

Conclusion: 引力波测量有望在未来十年内有效解决 Hubble 调查。

Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a novel and independent measurement of
cosmological parameters, offering a promising avenue to address the Hubble
tension alongside traditional electromagnetic observations. In the absence of
electromagnetic counterparts or complete host galaxy catalogs, current
measurements rely on population-based methods that statistically combine black
hole merger events. Building on recent models that incorporate additional
structure in the primary black hole mass distribution, using public data from
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration third observing run (O3), we obtain a
30% accuracy improvement on the measurement of the Hubble constant with respect
to the result reported by LVK. Employing a realistic simulation that includes
full Bayesian single-event inference, we present forecasts for the upcoming LVK
observational runs, O4 and O5. Using a three power-law mass model, we project a
measurement of the Hubble constant with 20% accuracy at O4 sensitivity,
improving to 2.7% accuracy at O5 sensitivity. Our findings demonstrate the
potential for gravitational waves to provide a substantial contribution to
solving the Hubble tension within the next decade of observations.

*Gerasimos Kouniatalis,Arthur G. Suvorov,Kyriakos Destounis*

TL;DR: Astrophysical black holes may have surrounding matter that significantly affects lensing effects in fully relativistic setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relevance of real environments of black holes is examined, particularly beyond simplistic Newtonian or post-Newtonian models.

Method: An exact general relativistic solution for a black hole in a Hernquist halo is used to analyze deflection angles and image amplification.

Result: The presence of 'bumps' in the mass distribution affects bright lensing inferences, and gravitational waves can have echo-like effects from such lenses.

Conclusion: Using exact general relativistic solutions, modifications to lensing effects caused by surrounding matter in realistic astrophysical scenarios are studied and analyzed.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of
matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined
the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves
from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a
Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on
the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity
describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter
distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully
relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'' corresponding to the peak
of the mass distribution can significantly adjust the inferences made for
either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider
``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than
being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for analyzing the stability of rotating black hole spacetimes using the conformal properties of the Weyl tensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to develop a unified method for analyzing perturbations in black hole spacetimes, revealing new insights into quasinormal mode frequencies and their relationship to the spacetime's conformal structure.

Method: The method involves constructing a new conformal invariant from the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, deriving a master equation that unifies existing formalisms (Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli), and proving two fundamental theorems regarding mode stability and isospectrality.

Result: The formalism predicts new branches in the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes, with frequencies differing from standard predictions by up to 3.7% in the near-extremal regime. These results enhance understanding in gravitational wave astronomy and strong-field tests of general relativity.

Conclusion: The work provides a significant advancement in black hole perturbation theory, offering a comprehensive framework for analyzing black hole stability and quasinormal modes.

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework for analysing the stability of
rotating black hole spacetimes through the conformal properties of the Weyl
tensor. By introducing a new conformal invariant constructed from the electric
and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, we derive a master equation governing
perturbations that unifies the Teukolsky and Regge-Wheeler- Zerilli formalisms.
Our approach reveals previously unrecognised relationships between quasinormal
mode frequencies and the conformal structure of the spacetime.We prove two
fundamental theorems: (i) the conformal stability criterion, which relates mode
stability to the sign-definiteness of our conformal invariant, and (ii) the
isospectrality theorem for conformally related black hole spacetimes. Numerical
calculations for Kerr black holes demonstrate that our formalism predicts new
branches in the quasinormal mode spectrum, with frequencies differing from
standard predictions by up to 3.7% in the near-extremal regime. These results
have significant implications for gravitational wave astronomy and tests of
general relativity in the strong-field regime.

TL;DR: Gravitational wave observations provide a novel way to study dark matter's influence on neutron stars by constraining parameters like DM fraction and mass scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dark matter's influence on neutron stars and gravitational waves offers a new avenue for studying dark matter.

Method: Analyzing GW data from binary coalescences to constrain dark matter parameters under scalar field models with self-interactions.

Result: Upper bounds on dark matter fraction $F_	ext{χ}$ and mass $m_	ext{χ}$ vary by binary system, with GW190814 allowing a DM halo configuration and others suggesting DM cores with tighter bounds on $F_	ext{χ}$ and $m_	ext{χ}$.

Conclusion: This approach successfully probes dark matter interaction with neutron stars through gravitational waves, opening a new window for studying dark matter properties.

Abstract: Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to
probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has
focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of
DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly
alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal
deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during
binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that,
for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using
real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115,
and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and
particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a
scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on
$F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating
that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in
different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM
halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105
and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding
strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale
$m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to
probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.

Abstract: Chen and Teo have constructed a two-parameter family of five dimensional,
stationary vacuum black hole solutions whose spatial hypersurfaces are
asymptotically locally Euclidean with boundary at infinity is $L(2,1)$. Spatial
cross sections of the event horizon have topology $S^3$ equipped with
inhomogeneous metrics. When the mass is zero, the solution reduces to the
trivial product of time with the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton. We show
that the spacetime metric can be smoothly extended through an event horizon and
that the exterior region is stably causal. We also investigate their geometric

first law of black hole mechanics hold and compute the renormalized
gravitational action.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is likely to explore the long-term stability and dynamics of boson stars, which could have implications for our understanding of gravitational collapse and quantum mechanics in extreme conditions.

Method: The paper uses fully non-linear simulations of ultracompact spherically symmetric boson stars. The authors observe dynamics and attribute them to the fundamental radial mode. They also decompose data in spherical harmonics as a first step towards understanding non-spherical modes.

Result: The key result is that the fundamental radial mode explains the observed dynamics of the spherically symmetric boson stars. Additionally, spherical harmonics decomposition provides an initial characterization of non-spherical modes, suggesting that such configurations may be further explored in future work.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the fundamental radial mode is sufficient to explain the observed dynamics of ultracompact spherically symmetric boson stars. The authors propose that further research into non-spherical modes, particularly through spherical harmonics decomposition, could provide deeper insights into the behavior of these compact objects.

Abstract: Recent fully non-linear simulations of ultracompact spherically symmetric
boson stars have presented evidence for their long-term stability. All observed

Abstract: We present new insights into the phenomenology of post-Newtonian spin
precession in black-hole binaries. Using multi-timescale methods, previous work
has shown that the precession and nutation dynamics in such systems can be
classified into so-called spin morphologies --mutually exclusive regions that
partition the configuration space and characterize the motion of the black-hole
spins relative to the binary's angular momentum. Radiation reaction can induce
secular transitions between different morphology classes, which are generic
occurrences during the inspiral of black-hole binaries. In this contribution,
we systematically explore a more restrictive class of solutions in which
multiple morphological transitions occur concurrently, i.e., within the same
precession cycle. We find that all such cases can be mapped and characterized
analytically, and we confirm these findings through numerical integrations.
These coincident transitions correspond to extreme spin configurations in
black-hole binaries with potential observational signatures in
gravitational-wave astronomy.

Abstract: Greybody factors for Proca fields in Schwarzschild black hole spacetime are
investigated. The radial equations are derived by separating the field
equations using vector spherical harmonics and decoupling the even-parity
sector through Frolov-Krtou\v{s}-Kubiz\v{n}\'ak-Santos transformation in the
static limit. Semi-analytical methods, including a rigorous bound and the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation, are used to compute the transmission
probabilities. In addition to reproducing known results, two distinctive
features are identified. In the even-parity vector mode, a low-mass regime is
found where the transmission probability exceeds that of the massless case for
a set of common energy and angular momentum parameters. In the even-parity
scalar mode, the massless limit reproduces the result of massless scalar
perturbations and corresponds to a pure gauge mode in Maxwell theory. In the
same mode, the transmission probability in the massive case is systematically
lower than that of a massive scalar field with the same parameters.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In a previous study I had found that gravitational particle production (to be
more specific, gravitational vacuum polarization) results in an effective
increase in the directly measured value of the Hubble constant (such as in SN
Ia measurements) while it does not affect the value of the Hubble constant
derived from energy densities (such as in CMB calculations in the framework of
$\Lambda$CDM). It had been pointed out that this may explain why the values of
Hubble constant determined from direct and indirect measurements are different.
In the present study, first I extend the analysis to the $\sigma_8$ tension,
and then to determination of the Hubble constant through observations of fast
radio bursts. It is observed that inclusion of the effect of gravitational
vacuum polarization essentially does not neither mitigate nor exacerbate the
$\sigma_8$ tension (while it mitigates or relieves the Hubble tension). This
result may provide a significant progress in the resolution of the Hubble and
the $\sigma_8 tensions$ in the light of the studies in literature that question
existence of a true $\sigma_8$ tension. Moreover, in this scheme the value of
the Hubble constant measured in fast radio bursts $\hat{H}_0$ is related to the
value of the Hubble constant measured in direct measurements $H_0$ and the
value of the Hubble constant used in parametrization of energy densities
$\bar{H}_0$ by $\hat{H}_0=\frac{\bar{H}_0}{H_0}\bar{H}_0$ which may be checked
with observations in future after more precise and conclusive measurements of
$\hat{H}_0$, $\bar{H}_0$, $H_0$.

*Yi-Yang Guo,Soumya D. Mohanty,Xie Qunying,Yu-Xiao Liu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: A new method called ABNORMAL, based on deep neural networks, is developed for detecting anomalies in gravitational wave data. It is unique in that it is trained exclusively on simulated Gaussian noise, avoiding reliance on real data during training. This innovation resolves a circular paradox in anomaly detection. The method uses an autoencoder-based DNN architecture with time-frequency analysis through Gabor and Wavelet filter banks, combined with multi-view fusion. It has been tested on both simulated and real LIGO data, revealing a variety of anomalies across different timescales, some of which do not fit into known classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the detection capabilities of gravitational wave data is essential for expanding our understanding of astrophysical phenomena by identifying signals of potential interest, particularly those from non-standard sources.

Method: ABNORMAL is an AI-driven anomaly detection method employing a deep neural network (DNN) specifically trained on simulated Gaussian noise. The method integrates time-frequency analysis using Gabor and Wavelet transforms and implements multi-view fusion through a dual-path architecture to enhance anomaly detection capabilities.

Result: ABNORMAL successfully distinguishes between different types of noise and useful signals in gravitational wave data. It has identified anomalies in both simulated and real data that are beyond conventional classification schemes.

Conclusion: ABNORMAL represents a novel approach to anomaly detection in gravitational wave data. By avoiding reliance on real data during training, it provides an effective solution to a previously unsolvable problem. The findings open new avenues for analyzing gravitational wave signals and detecting events with unknown characteristics.

Abstract: The detection and classification of anomalies in gravitational wave data
plays a critical role in improving the sensitivity of searches for signals of
astrophysical origins. We present ABNORMAL (AI Based Nonstationarity Observer
for Resectioning and Marking AnomaLies), a deep neural network (DNN) model for
anomaly detection that is trained exclusively on simulated Gaussian noise. By
removing dependence on real data for training, the method resolves a circular
paradox in anomaly detection: training on real data implicitly involves prior
segregation of stationary from non-stationary data but this is not possible
unless all anomalies are detected first. ABNORMAL is an autoencoder-based DNN,
commonly used in anomaly detection, with the key innovation that it is trained
to predict statistical features of noise rather than reconstructing the noise
time series themselves. The statistical features are obtained by applying Gabor
and Wavelet filter banks, which implement time-frequency analysis, and are
subsequently combined through multi-view fusion using a dual-path architecture.
We quantify the performance of our method on simulated and real LIGO data.
Application to data from the O1 to O3b observational runs uncovers a rich
landscape of anomalies over different timescales, including many that do not
fit within known classes.

Abstract: In this work, we establish the existence conditions and a universal upper
bound on the radius of stable photon spheres (SPS) outside the event horizons
of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes surrounded by
matter fields. We prove that stable photon spheres exist if the external matter
satisfies specific conditions. Furthermore, under the additional assumption of
a monotonically decreasing mass-radius ratio $m(r)/r^3$ outside the horizon, we
derive a strict upper bound on the radius $r_{\mathrm{sps}}$ of any stable
photon sphere: $r_{\mathrm{sps}}<6M$, where $M$ is the asymptotic mass of the
black hole. This bound is independent of specific black hole solutions and
broadly applies to hairy black holes and other configurations with external
matter fields meeting the stated energy conditions. Our results resolve
fundamental questions regarding the existence and spatial constraints on stable
photon orbits, with implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk
dynamics (e.g., the Aschenbach effect), and black hole shadow observations.

Abstract: We analyze the observational features of hot-spots orbiting parametrized
black hole (BH) spacetimes. We select a total of four BH spacetimes, two from
the Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) parametrization, and two from the Konoplya-Zhidenko
(KZ) parametrization, corresponding to the most extreme configurations whose
shadow sizes are within the $2\sigma$-constraints of the Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT). We use the ray-tracing software GYOTO to simulate the orbit of
a spherically symmetric hot-spot emitting synchrotron radiation close to a
central parametrized BH object, in a vertical magnetic field configuration, and
we extract the corresponding astrometric and polarimetric observables for the
Stokes parameters I, Q and U, namely the time integrated fluxes, temporal
fluxes and magnitudes, temporal centroid, temporal QU-loops, and temporal
Electric Field Position Angle (EVPA). Our results indicate that at low
inclination the astrometric observables extracted from the parametrized BH
spacetimes considered are qualitatively similar to those extracted from the
Schwarzschild one, with minor quantitative deviations caused by differences in
the size and position of the secondary images. On the other hand, the
polarimetric observables at high inclination present qualitative differences,
but these are only visible for a short portion of the whole hot-spot orbit.
Furthermore, the observables extracted from the JP parametrized BH models
deviate more prominently from those of the Schwarzschild model than the ones
extracted from the KZ parametrized BH models, with the JP model with a positive
free parameter deviating the most among all models tested. Given the strong
similarity among the observables extracted from all models tested, we point out
that more precise observations are needed to successfully impose constraints on

Abstract: Gravitational redshift is an important prediction of General Relativity (GR).
We propose a novel dual one-way frequency comparison scheme for gravitational
redshift tests in satellite-ground clock experiments. Unlike conventional
triple-link Doppler cancellation methods, our approach requires only two
optical links, an uplink and a downlink, with Doppler data recorded
independently at the satellite and ground station, respectively. Crucially,
coherent combination of these measurements suppresses first-order Doppler
frequency shift to second order while doubling the gravitational redshift
signal. This scheme reduced engineering complexity (50$\%$ fewer links) and
amplified redshift sensitivity with a factor of 2 for satellite-ground clock
comparison. The scheme's viability hinges on high-precision clock
synchronization ($\leq$ 0.1 ns for $10^{-18}$ clock comparison), which is
potentially achievable via state-of-the-art time-transfer techniques.
Systematic error analysis confirms residual Doppler, atmospheric, and Shapiro
shifts remain below $10^{-17}$ for optimized orbits, establishing this scheme
as a useful tool for probing fundamental physics beyond GR.

Motivation: The paper aims to find new teleparallel $$$F(T)$$$ solutions in different cosmological cases.

Method: Utilizes TRW $$$F(T)$$$ gravity field equations for each $k$-parameter value and gas equation of state.

Result: Derives analytical solutions for flat case and approximated solutions for curved cases with varying expansion scenarios.

Conclusion: Solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications including dark energy and AdS spacetimes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$
gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas
cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for
each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to
find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case,
we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For
curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel
$F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases
summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be
relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE)
quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other
cosmological processes.

Abstract: How long does a uniformly rotating observer need to interact with a quantum
field in order to register an approximately thermal response due to the
circular motion Unruh effect? We address this question for a massless scalar
field in 2+1 dimensions, defining the effective temperature via the ratio of
excitation and de-excitation rates of an Unruh-DeWitt detector in the long
interaction time limit. In this system, the effective temperature is known to
be significantly smaller than the linear motion Unruh effect prediction when
the detector's energy gap is small: the effective temperature tends to zero in
the small gap limit, linearly in the gap. We show that a positive small gap
temperature at long interaction times can be regained via a controlled
long-time-small-gap double limit, provided the detector's coupling to the field
is allowed to change sign. The resulting small gap temperature depends on the
parameters of the circular motion but not on the details of the detector's
switching. The results broaden the energy range for pursuing an experimental
verification of the circular motion Unruh effect in analogue spacetime
experiments. As a mathematical tool, we provide a new implementation of the
long interaction time limit that controls in a precise way the asymptotics of
both the switching function and its Fourier transform.

Conclusion: Hayward时空对引力准正常模式的校正显示出有趣的量子效应，特别是对于次主导模式。

Abstract: We study gravitational quasinormal modes of the Hayward spacetime, a regular
black-hole geometry that also admits an interpretation as an effective
quantum-corrected solution within asymptotically safe gravity. Using both the
higher-order WKB method supplemented with Pade approximants and time-domain
integration with Prony analysis, we obtain accurate spectra for axial
perturbations and explore the impact of the quantum parameter $\gamma$. We find
that increasing $\gamma$ systematically raises the oscillation frequencies
while reducing the damping rates, making the ringdown longer lived. For the
first overtone, the effect of $\gamma$ is noticeably stronger than for the
fundamental mode, providing an indication of the so-called outburst of
overtones previously observed for test fields, and pointing to the particular
sensitivity of subdominant modes to near-horizon quantum corrections. In
addition, the analytic approximation for quasinormal modes are obtained in the
form of expansion beyond the eikonal limit.

Abstract: We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of
spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified
gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending
earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a
flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on
polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number
of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel
in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict
attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the
speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy
density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time
reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We
compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations,
finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including
scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our
results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to
probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.

Abstract: We show a gravitational spin-orbit interaction that can potentially modify
the space-time geometry naturally emerges in the framework of Poincar\'e gauge
theory. For this purpose, we derive the field equations of a particular model
with cubic order invariants and demonstrate the existence of analytical
solutions which display an interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic
angular momentum parameters in the gravitational action, in analogy to the
spin-orbit interaction arising from atomic and nuclear systems. Due to the
highly nonlinear character of the field equations under stationary and
axisymmetric conditions, we focus on a degenerate case which simplifies their
complexity, at the cost of constraining the geometry to the Kerr space-time.
Thereby, our results indicate more general solutions with a spin-orbit
interaction beyond the Kerr space-time are expected to arise in the
nondegenerate models of Poincar\'e gauge theory.

Abstract: We search for nearly-monochromatic gravitational wave signals with
frequencies $800.0~\textrm{Hz} \leq f \leq 1686.0~\textrm{Hz}$ and spin-down
$-2.7\times10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1} \leq \dot f \leq 0.2\times

Hanford and Livingston detectors and deploy this search on the Einstein@Home
volunteer-computing project. This is the most sensitive search carried out to
date in this parameter space. Our results are consistent with a non-detection.
We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$ and translate
these to upper limits on neutron star ellipticity and on r-mode amplitude. The
most stringent upper limits are at $800~\textrm{Hz}$ with $h_{0} =
1.32\times10^{-25}$, at the $90\%$ confidence level. Searching in the high
frequency bands allows us to probe astrophysically interesting ellipticities
with our results excluding isolated neutron stars rotating faster than
$2.5~\textrm{ms}$ with ellipticities $\epsilon \geq 1.96 \times
10^{-8}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ within a distance $d$ from
Earth. Our results also exclude r-mode amplitudes $\alpha \geq 7 \times
10^{-7}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ for neutron stars stars spinning
faster than 400 Hz.

TL;DR: A mild modification to Newtonian gravity enables the sun to capture high-energy cosmic protons, explaining their observed production and challenging current astrophysical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The promotion of accelerator-based nuclear astrophysics was driven by the need to understand high-energy cosmic rays, supported by recent data from the ISS, and the limitations in understanding their sources.

Method: The study involved theoretical modifications to Newtonian gravity and simulations of the 'Double Slingshot' mechanism, combined with experiments in a storage ring studying rear-end collisions.

Result: The revised gravitational model explains the origin of high-energy cosmic rays and provides a framework for understanding processes like proton capture within the solar system.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for advancing accelerator-based nuclear astrophysics and reevaluating our understanding of gravity and cosmic ray production.

Abstract: Begun as part of a promotion of accelerator-based nuclear astrophysics,
research toward this goal has shifted to cosmic ray production within the solar
system. This has been motivated by the high quality of data collected recently
by programs such as the International Space Station (ISS), by the fundamental
importance of the topic, and by the unsatisfactory state of our understanding
of the actual source of cosmic rays. A ``minor'' change in the Newtonian
gravitational formulation converts solar production of high energy cosmic rays
from ``impossible'' to ``likely'', without much disrupting the vast existent
domain of well understood astronomical gravitational processes. This change
enables the sun to ``capture'' protons of energy so high that they would,
otherwise, escape the solar system. This change in Newton's gravitational
formula would disrupt current cosmological understanding of missing mass and
dark energy. With this changed understanding of gravity, it has been quite easy
to produce a semi-quantitative understanding of the solar origin of cosmic rays
up to energies at least as great as $10^6$\,GeV/nucleon that have by now been
detected and measured so persuasively. A ``Double Slingshot'' mechanism is
proposed according to which at least a substantial fraction of all cosmic rays
could have begun their life within the solar system. Accelerator-based nuclear
astrophysics is promoted, beginning with the functioning of an ``{\rm E}\&{\rm
M}'' storage ring for laboratory-based study of processes such as ${\rm 6LI} +
{\rm 7Li} \rightarrow {\rm 13C} + \gamma$. Especially to be emphasized are
experiments made possible by ''rear-end collisions'' between nuclear isotopes
of two different types traveling simultaneously at different velocities in the
same direction in the same storage ring. This amounts to ``studying nuclear
physics in a moving frame of reference''.

Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN has been instrumental in recent
advances in experimental high energy physics by colliding beams of protons and
heavier nuclei at unprecedented energies. The present heavy-ion programme is
based mainly on colliding lead nuclei. For future ion runs, there is strong
interest to achieve a significantly higher integrated nucleon-nucleon
luminosity, which might be achieved through collisions of species other than
Pb. In this paper, we explore the nucleon-nucleon luminosity projections in the
LHC for a selection of ion species ranging from He to Xe, and including Pb as
reference. Alternative beam production schemes are investigated as a way to
mitigate effects such as space charge that degrade the beam quality in the LHC
injectors. In the most optimistic scenarios, we find up to about a factor~4
improvement in integrated nucleon-nucleon luminosity for a typical future
one-month run, with respect to the present Pb programme. We also outline a
future study programme and experiments to test the assumptions and refine the
simulated projections put forward in this article.

Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by
periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven
method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to
construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our
approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal
correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic
trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application
to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order
model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by
the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the
marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and
spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation
metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling
generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks
required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new
possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across
diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing
computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling
applications.

TL;DR: The paper examines whether long-range correlations in sentence length indicate literary style and concludes that such correlations are not sufficient for literary analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to disprove the notion that sentence length correlations are a fundamental feature of literary style by using randomized texts.

Method: The research involved creating randomized linguistic sequences in Chinese and English to test the presence of sentence length correlations.

Result: The randomized texts showed similar or stronger long-range correlations in sentence length than literary works.

Conclusion: Thus, long-range sentence length correlations are not reliable indicators of literary style or authorial intent.

Abstract: This study re-evaluates the assumption that long-range correlations in
sentence length are a fundamental feature of natural language and a marker of
literary style. While previous research has suggested that punctuation
marks--particularly full stops--generate structural regularities in narrative
texts, our experiments challenge this view. Using Chinese as the primary
language, supplemented with English, we constructed randomized linguistic
sequences through three distinct methods. Surprisingly, these randomized texts
also exhibit long-range correlations in sentence length, some even with
stronger fractal characteristics than those found in canonical literary works.
These findings suggest that the presence of long-range correlations in sentence
length is not sufficient to indicate authorial intention, structural depth, or
literary value. We argue that punctuation-induced long-range correlations have
limited value for literary stylistic analysis and cannot be considered a
fundamental characteristic of human writing.
