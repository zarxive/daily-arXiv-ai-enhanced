Using an effective PXQ model, we demonstrate that the associated Hilbert space decomposes into disconnected, dimer-conserving subspaces. The classification of these subspaces is provided, and the computational basis states spanning them are identified. Through a combination of analytical mapping and numerical simulations, we compare the dynamics of the PXQ model with those of the full Rydberg atom chain. The deviations are attributed to two factors, laser-induced leakage from the constrained Hilbert subspace and the influence of long-range interactions beyond the NN limit. Our results indicate that subspace leakage can be mitigated by increasing the NN interaction strength. While this simultaneously amplifies the effects of long-range interactions, the conservation of the dimer number remains. Our study opens up possibilities for exploring the dynamics of antiferromagnetic dimers using the Rydberg atom quantum simulator."}

Of particular interest are non-Gaussian, extreme-value statistics that arise when nontrivial correlations and criticality dominate over the central limit theorem. Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments."}

While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking."}

The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\\sim 600-900 μA$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures."}

Achieving high-frequency fluctuation while maintaining reliable control over output level is critical for applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of magnetic damping in regulating thermal switching rates using macrospin simulations. We show that enhanced damping accelerates the switching rate by increasing the escape rate over the energy barrier. We further compare two control mechanisms: spin-transfer torque (STT) and voltage-controlled exchange coupling (VCEC). Our results reveal that STT-based switching is strongly suppressed under high damping, whereas VCEC, by reshaping the energy landscape without relying on torque-driven dynamics, retains high control efficiency. These findings suggest that enhanced damping not only enables faster stochastic switching in sMTJs but also makes VCEC inherently better suited than STT for high-frequency applications."}

The quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system of polarized states or their superposition, that could be relaxed to mixed states, can therefore manifest an exact or asymptotic quadratic scaling with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$. The quadratic scaling behavior is found to be insensitive to the imperfect encoding operator and coupling strength. By virtue of the parity detection on the ancillary qubit or the probe system, the phase sensitivity can approach the Heisenberg limit. We suggest that the unconditional measurement on qubit could become an efficient resource to replace Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states and squeezing Hamiltonian for exceeding the standard quantum limit in metrology precision."}

Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These results establish optical frequency division as a generic method for generation of sub-terahertz carriers with coherence no longer constrained by direct-generation limits."}

This speed corresponds to the maximum mean flow velocity below which dissipation is absent. In the weak-obstacle regime, linear-response theory shows that the critical speed is set by Landau's criterion applied to the density and spin Bogoliubov modes, whose relative ordering can be inverted due to saturation of the optical nonlinearity. For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle. Beyond superfluids of light, our results provide a general framework for the critical speed of 2D binary nonlinear Schrödinger superflows, including Bose-Bose quantum mixtures."}

Restricting to spherical symmetry and time-symmetric initial data, we formulate a numerically tractable version of the Jang/conformal flow system. Our numerical results show no evidence of a finite radius breakdown analogous to that observed by Jaracz. Instead, the Jang slope remains regular and approaches its limiting value asymptotically. This behavior persists under controlled perturbations of the warping factor, indicating robustness of the observed phenomenon. These findings suggest that coupling to conformal flow of metrics alters the obstruction mechanism present in the Jang/zero divergence system, and hence that this system may still be viable for proving the Penrose conjecture."}

In this study, the response of a molecular rotor in binary and ternary macromolecular aqueous solutions of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of different molecular weights is investigated in order to better rationalize the sensitivity of rotors to their cybotactic environment. More precisely, for the investigated composition range of ternary mixtures, it is shown that a linear mixing rule applies for fluorescence lifetime with the proportion of the two PEG, and with an increasing ratio of heavy PEG leading to larger lifetimes. These results allow to test more precisely the free volume theory, which has been proposed in the context of probing glass transition.

We investigate this change of symmetry from both configuration space and phase space point of view, while keeping the notion of Legendre Transformation unchanged during the flow. By expanding the actions, in the extreme limits of the flow parameter, we recover the usual ``Electric'' Carroll theory and further uncover a novel ``Magnetic'' counterpart.

Conventional transfer techniques often fail due to reliance on high temperature, corrosive chemicals, or mechanical peeling, leading to pattern damage, low fidelity, or poor biocompatibility. Here, we report a transfer strategy utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) carrier soluble tape, enabling rapid, residue-free, high-fidelity transfer of nanodiamond patterns onto diverse biointerfaces. The success of this method is rooted in a unique \"hydrate-soften-expand-self-peel\" mechanism of the soluble tape with PVA backing. In situ mechanical tracking reveals non-uniform PVA swelling upon hydration generates transient local normal and shear stresses at the interface. These stresses delaminate the tape within 3 minutes at room temperature while promoting adhesion of the nanodiamond array to the substrate. In contrast, conventional water-soluble tapes with composite structures undergo passive dissolution and collapse, causing residue contamination and reduced efficiency. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieve conformal patterning on ultra-soft hydrogels (~0.6 kPa) and highly curved bio-surfaces (hair, 100 μm^-1). Additionally, we demonstrate a dual-identity verification system integrating data storage and physical unclonable functions on a hydrogel contact lens.

When quantum information is encoded redundantly, a larger Hilbert space is constructed using multiple physical qubits, and the computation is performed within a designated subspace. When applying deep learning to the decoding of quantum error-correcting codes, a key challenge arises from the non-uniqueness between the syndrome measurements provided to the decoder and the corresponding error patterns that constitute the ground-truth labels. Building upon prior work that addressed this issue for the toric code by re-optimizing the decoder with respect to the symmetry inherent in the parity-check structure, we generalize this approach to arbitrary stabilizer codes. In our experiments, we employed multilayer perceptrons to approximate continuous functions that complement the syndrome measurements of the Color code and the Golay code. Using these models, we performed decoder re-optimization for each code. For the Color code, we achieved an improvement of approximately 0.8% in decoding accuracy at a physical error rate of 5%, while for the Golay code the accuracy increased by about 0.1%. Furthermore, from the evaluation of the geometric and algebraic structures in the continuous function approximation for each code, we showed that the design of generalized continuous functions is advantageous for learning the geometric structure inherent in the code. Our results also indicate that approximations that faithfully reproduce the code structure can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of reoptimization. This study demonstrates that the re-optimization technique previously shown to be effective for the Toric code can be generalized to address the challenge of label degeneracy that arises when applying deep learning to the decoding of stabilizer codes."}

Strikingly, in two-dimensional (2D) quantum fluids, such effects have been predicted to manifest in the order parameter distribution in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) superfluid phase, which approaches a universal extreme-value form in the low-temperature limit. Here, we measure the order parameter statistics of 2D Bose gases across the BKT critical point using matter-wave interferometry. This allows us to confirm the predicted convergence of the observed statistics to a universal Gumbel distribution at low temperatures, to the 0.1% level of the probability density. Furthermore, the intrinsic precision of the atom interferometer allows the robust extraction of higher-moment observables such as skewness and kurtosis; in particular, we report direct measurements of the Binder cumulant which allows us to precisely identify the onset of the phase transition. Extending this approach to the investigation of non-equilibrium systems, we probe vortex unbinding dynamics following a quench across the BKT critical point and identify parameter-independent scaling behaviour of higher moments."}

The PBD model represents DNA as a chain of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, which makes it possible to analyze the processes of melting and mechanical denaturation. The main focus is on cases where an external force is applied to the terminal or central site of a DNA molecule, simulating stretching at a constant rate. The critical force required to break hydrogen bonds, which depends on the point of application of the force, is calculated. It is found that the denaturation process occurs stepwise, with characteristic peaks in the force-time graphs. The phenomenon of hysteresis under periodic exposure to external forces is also studied, which is important for understanding energy losses and heating of the system."}

WL magnetoconductance measured in a perpendicular magnetic field yields a phase-coherence length of approximately 50 nm. In contrast, UCF amplitudes are comparable to e squared over h even for an 8 micrometer long segment, and nonlocal magnetoconductance persists across a 4 micrometer separation of electrodes, revealing phase-coherent transport over micrometer length scales within a single bundle. The coexistence of short- and long-range coherence implies that locally diffusive electrons remain partially phase-correlated among nanotubes within the same bundle. These findings challenge the conventional single-scale picture of mesoscopic coherence and establish carbon nanotube bundles as a model platform for emergent, network-level quantum transport."}

We focus on the computational two-way quantum capacity and showcase that it is closely related to the computational distillable entanglement of the Choi state of the channel. This connection allows us to show a stark computational capacity separation. Under standard cryptographic assumptions, there exists a quantum channel of polynomial complexity whose computational two-way quantum capacity vanishes while its unbounded counterpart is nearly maximal. More so, we show that there exists a sharp transition in computational quantum capacity from nearly maximal to zero when the channel complexity leaves the polynomial realm. Our results demonstrate that the natural requirement of computational efficiency can radically alter the limits of quantum communication."}

For the solvable models above, these tensors are quadratic tensors based on quadratic functions. Quadratic tensors with $n$ degrees of freedom are fully specified by only $O(n^2)$ coefficients. Tensor networks of quadratic tensors can be contracted efficiently on the level of these coefficients, using an operation reminiscent of the Schur complement. Our formalism naturally includes models with mixed degrees of freedom, such as qudits of different dimensions. We also use quadratic functions to define generalized stabilizer codes and Clifford gates for arbitrary abelian groups. Finally, we give a generalization from quadratic (or 2nd order) to $i$th order tensors, which are specified by $O(n^i)$ coefficients but cannot be contracted efficiently in general."}

These observations were interpreted as evidence for a direct link between superconductivity and the charge-transfer gap, and more broadly revived the long-standing question of the role of apical oxygens in cuprate superconductivity. Using a combination of density-functional theory and cluster dynamical mean-field theory, we compute from first principles the variations of $m_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ induced solely by apical oxygen displacement in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+δ}$, Bi-2212, and HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+δ}$.

This approach reveals how network topology shapes quantum dissipative dynamics, providing a basis for controlling quantum coherence through tailored network structures. Second, we propose a mean-field approach that extends the network to larger scales and captures dissipative dynamics in large-scale networks, connecting network topology to quantum coherence in complex systems and revealing the sensitivity of quantum coherence to network structure.

In this study, we report the epitaxial synthesis of novel room-temperature ferromagnetic insulating thin films, achieved through the precise construction of (111)-oriented 3d/5d interfaces. Our analysis indicates that, unlike conventional doping methods, the (111)-oriented SrIrO3/La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (SIO/LSMO) interfaces exhibit markedly enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This enhanced interfacial SOC strengthens the electron-phonon coupling in LSMO, thereby shortening the electronic mean free path.

Furthermore, the temperature window of the FMI state can be tuned by precisely controlling the thickness of the LSMO layers.

The general problem addressed here is whether strain alone explains quantum emitter formation and placement in MoSe$_2$, or whether dielectric contrast at suspended-supported interfaces is also required. Here, we combine hyperspectral superlocalization of photoluminescence with co-registered AFM topography and phase to map the positions of localized states (LS) in MoSe$_2$ suspended on GaN pillars and correlate them with bending strain and the local dielectric context. Contrary to the common assumption of purely strain-driven activation, LS frequently occur at suspended--supported interfaces around the pillar apex and span a broad strain range without a clear threshold, while being scarce along high-strain ripples. Our data indicate that deterministic emitter positioning in Mo-based TMDs benefits from co-engineering both strain gradients and nanoscale dielectric heterogeneity, rather than strain alone.

Here, we study stabilizer and subsystem codes with constrained check weight, combining analytical arguments with numerical optimization to establish strong upper bounds on their parameters. We show that stabilizer codes with checks of weight at most three cannot have nontrivial distance. We also prove tight tradeoffs between rate and distance for broad families of CSS stabilizer and subsystem codes with checks of weight at most four and two, respectively.

These systems are notoriously difficult to solve, even with state-of-the-art numerical methods, especially in regimes of parameters where degrees of freedom compete or cooperate at similar energy and length scales. Here, we introduce a spin-1 slave-particle technique to approximately treat the t-U-V-J fermionic model at arbitrary electron dopings in an economical manner. This formalism respectively maps the original charge and spin degrees of freedom into effective pseudo-spin and pseudo-fermion sectors, which are treated using a self-consistent cluster mean-field method. We study the phase diagram of the model under various conditions and report the appearance of charge and spin stripes within this formalism. These stripes are a consequence of the cluster mean-field treatment of the pseudo-particle sectors and have not been detected in previous slave-particle studies. The results obtained agree qualitatively well with what more reliable numerical methods capture."}

Shifting from traditional torque-based descriptions to an operational symmetry perspective, we develop two complementary viewpoints: a vector perspective identifying infinite degenerate Rigid Body Precession (RBP) states where exchange energy depends solely on the total magnetic momentum, and a particle perspective decomposing dynamics into Center-of-Mass (CM) translation and Relative Motion (RM) oscillation. Using time-dependent rotational and translational transformation techniques, we analytically resolve the rapid (~10 ps) transient evolution into a stable RBP state driven by SOT and damping. We demonstrate that the out-of-plane anisotropy (OPA) lifts the exchange degeneracy, triggering a long-term (~1 ns) oscillatory decay toward a steady state characterized by uniform spin z-components and a 120-degree inter-spin locking angle. This state is accurately governed by our Terminal Velocity Motion (TVM) model [arXiv:2305.14013], where exchange coupling transforms into kinetic energy with a light effective mass. The model precisely predicts SOT-driven transients, hysteretic excitation, and the dynamic phase diagram. Finally, we account for the sub-critical current regime mismatch by identifying a 'Rigid-Body Breaking' effect: a surge in effective friction caused by the self-resonance of RM variables induced by CM translation, mediated by the in-plane anisotropy (IPA)."}

Accordingly, information-theoretic studies have emerged as a promising avenue for probing the fundamental performance bounds of of GI and related computational imaging paradigms. However, the design of information-theoretically optimal encoding strategies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the intractability of the prior probability density function (PDF) of an unknown scene. Here, by leveraging the ability of recursively estimating the PDF of the object to be imaged via Bayesian filtering, we propose to establish an adaptive information-maximization encoding (AIME) design framework. Based on the adaptively estimated posterior PDF from previously acquired measurements, the expected information gain of subsequent detections is evaluated and maximized to design the corresponding encoding patterns in a closed-loop manner. Within this framework, the theoretical form of the information-optimal encoding under representative physical constraints is analytically derived. Corresponding experimental results show that, GI systems employing information-optimal encoding achieve markedly improved imaging performance compared with conventional fixed point-to-point imaging without relying on additional heuristic regularization schemes, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Moreover, the proposed strategy consistently enables significantly enhanced information acquisition capability compared with existing encoding strategies, leading to substantially improved imaging quality. These results establish a principled information-theoretic foundation for optimal encoding design in computational imaging paradigms,provided that the forward model can be accurately characterized."}

Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it."}

However, its practical application remains constrained by the precise regulation of the interfacial gap. This study investigates the interfacial response and bonding mechanism of sapphire and Fe-36Ni alloy joints under controlled non-optical contact conditions using burst mode ultrafast laser irradiation. A polymer interlayer was introduced between naturally stacked samples to establish a variable interfacial gap, allowing systematic evaluation of gap-dependent morphology, melting behavior, and elemental transport. By redistributing the pulse energy into sequential sub-pulses, the burst mode reconstructs the temporal energy-deposition process, yielding enhanced plasma-material coupling and stable thermal accumulation. Compared with single pulse irradiation, burst mode sustains continuous bonding across gaps exceeding 10 um--far beyond the failure threshold of the single pulse mode--and forms a fusion zone 82% larger. Fracture surface and cross-sectional analyses of SEM and EDS results confirm that sequential sub-pulses promote extensive sapphire melting, droplet-driven gap bridging, and enhanced Al-Fe interdiffusion at the interface.

The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V$π$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm. The ring-based modulators have an intrinsic quality factor of 3.4 million and 1.9 million, a linear tuning strength of 0.9 GHz/V and 1 GHz/V, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.6 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. All four modulator designs maintain the low optical waveguide loss of SiN, are DC coupled with broadband frequency response, operate independent of wavelength, and consume only tens of nW per actuator. Such solutions unlock the potential for further integration with other precision SiN components to realize chip-scale atomic and quantum systems."}

In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications."}

Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles."}

Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime.

It represents 98.88 percent optimal performance, with 8.06 times computational speedup in unweighted graphs.

In 8.92 percent test cases, targeted single layer optimization outperformed the full optimization, indicating that complex parameter landscape can trap full optimization in sub-optimal local minima. To mitigate this inconsistency, ridge (L2) regularization is used to smoothen the solution landscape, which helps the optimizer to find better optimum parameters during full optimization and reduces these inconsistent test cases from 8.92 percent to 3.81 percent. This work demonstrates that efficient parameter initialization and targeted-single-layer optimization can improve the efficiency of QAOA with minimal performance degradation."}

Moreover, we also consider pseudo-doublers, which have high energy but behave like low energy Dirac particles, and cause potential problems regarding the stability of the vacuum. To address these issues, we propose a family of quantum walks, that are free of these doublers and pseudo-doublers, but still simulate the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, there remain a small number of additional low energy solutions which do not directly correspond to Dirac particles. While the conventional Dirac walk always has a zero probability for the walker staying at the same point, we obtain the family of walks by allowing this probability to be non-zero."}

The QFI isocontours reveal regimes where KS exhibit high fidelity and large amplitude, enabling their preparation via Gaussian operations and photon addition.

In the weak-obstacle regime, linear-response theory shows that the critical speed is set by Landau's criterion applied to the density and spin Bogoliubov modes, whose relative ordering can be inverted due to saturation of the optical nonlinearity. For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle.

While most automated optimization techniques focus on transforming circuits into equivalent ones that implement the same unitary, we show that substantial new opportunities for resource reduction can be achieved by (1) allowing approximate local transformations and (2) employing mixed quantum channels to approximate pure circuits. Our novel automated protocol for approximate circuit rewriting is a refined evolution of automated optimization techniques based on the ZX-calculus, where we add a greedy strategy that selectively replaces ZX-diagrams with small phase angles with stochastic mixtures of the identity and carefully chosen over-rotations, which are designed to reduce the overall gate count in expectation while staying within a strict error budget. This approach yields modest two-qubit gate count reduction in random quantum circuits, and achieves a substantial reduction in structured circuits such as the quantum Fourier transform. Fundamentally, our protocol converts experimental noise due to gate applications into deliberately engineered random noise, outperforming many other approximation methods on average. These results highlight the potential of mixed-channel approximations to enhance future quantum circuit performance, suggesting new directions for resource-aware automated quantum compilation beyond pure unitary channels."}

The relationship is characterized by an effective temperature of the final adiabatic state and holds for slow to moderate driving protocols. For fast protocols, the frictional work is instead described by the quantum relative entropy between the final non-adiabatic and adiabatic states. We compare our results to those obtained from an integrable spin chain, in which case the adiabatic state is no longer described by a single temperature.

Using only two bins, we observe a quantum enhancement of 1.2 dB compared to the classical method using the ideal measurement, improving towards 3.8 dB as the bin number increases. These results highlight a practical pathway to achieving quantum enhancement under the presence of severe experimental imperfections."}

While Shor's algorithm demands high-fidelity quantum gates, Hamiltonian optimization schemes, with prime factors encoded as degenerate ground states of a problem Hamiltonian, generally require substantial classical post-processing to determine control parameters. We propose an all-quantum, measurement-based feedback approach that iteratively steers a quantum system toward the target ground state, eliminating the need for classical computation of drive parameters once the problem Hamiltonian is determined and realized. As a proof of principle, we experimentally factor the biprime 551 using a three-qubit NMR quantum register and numerically analyze the robustness of the method against control field-errors. We further demonstrate scalability by numerically implementing the FALQON factorization of larger biprimes, 9,167 and 2,106,287, using 5 and 9 qubits, respectively."}

We first make this noise-independence principle precise in continuous time for multimode bosonic Gaussian Markov semigroups: for Hurwitz drift, a time-independent Gaussian similarity fixed by the Lyapunov equation gauges away diffusion for all times, so eigenvalues and non-diagonalizability are controlled entirely by the drift, while diffusion determines steady states and the structure of eigenoperators. We then extend the same separation to discrete time for general stable multimode bosonic Gaussian channels: for any stable Gaussian channel, we construct an explicit Gaussian similarity transformation that gauges away diffusion at the level of the channel parametrization. We illustrate the method with a single-mode squeezed-reservoir Lindbladian and with a non-Markovian family of single-mode Gaussian channels, where the exceptional-point manifolds and the associated gauging covariances can be obtained analytically."}

A practical decoder must operate with high accuracy at low latency, while remaining robust to spatial and temporal variations in hardware noise. We introduce a hardware-conditioned neural decoder framework designed to exploit the natural separation of timescales in superconducting processors, where calibration drifts occur over hours while error correction requires microsecond-scale responses. By processing calibration data through a graph-based encoder and conditioning a lightweight convolutional backbone via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM), we decouple the heavy processing of device statistics from the low-latency syndrome decoding.\n  We evaluate this approach using the 1D repetition code as a testbed on IBM Fez, Kingston, and Pittsburgh processors, collecting over 2.7 million experimental shots spanning distances up to d = 11. We demonstrate that a single trained model generalizes to unseen qubit chains and new calibration data acquired days later without retraining. On these unseen experiments, the FiLM-conditioned decoder achieves up to an 11.1x reduction in logical error rate relative to modified minimum-weight perfect matching. We observe that by employing a network architecture that exploits the highly asynchronous nature of system calibration and decoding, hardware-conditioned neural decoding demonstrates promising, adaptive performance with negligible latency overhead relative to unconditioned baselines."}

However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic.

Numerical simulations show that, unlike standard QAOA, SBO-QAOA yields ground-state probabilities converging to finite-temperature values with uniform distribution among degenerate states. These fairness and temperature-targeting properties are preserved even with only four variational parameters under a linear schedule."}

Understanding the convergence speed of these Lindbladians to their steady states is crucial for bounding algorithmic runtimes and thermalization timescales. We study two such families of processes: one characterizing a repeated-interaction Gibbs sampling algorithm, and another modeling open many-body quantum thermalization. We prove that both converge in polynomial time for several non-commuting systems, including high-temperature local lattices, weakly interacting fermions, and 1D spin chains. These results demonstrate that simple dissipative quantum algorithms can prepare complex Gibbs states and that Lindblad dynamics accurately capture thermal relaxation. Our proofs rely on a novel technical result that extrapolates spectral gap lower bounds from quasi-local Lindbladians to the non-local generators governing these dynamics."}

Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates of two-body Hamiltonians cannot satisfy $k$-body microscopic thermal equilibrium for any $k\\ge4$. We further show that this bound is tight by explicitly constructing two-body nonintegrable Hamiltonians whose stabilizer eigenstates reproduce thermal expectation values for all two-body and all three-body observables. Finally, we identify the structural origin of this limitation by characterizing the conditions under which a stabilizer state can appear as a zero-energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian, thereby revealing a fundamental constraint imposed by the few-body nature of interactions."}

Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport properties with improved energy resolution. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we prepare and evolve wavepackets on Quantinuum's H2-2 quantum computer and identify an energy-dependent localization transition in the Anderson model on an 8x7 lattice--a finite-size mobility edge. We observe that a wavepacket initialized at low energy remains spatially localized under time evolution, while a high-energy wavepacket delocalizes, consistent with the presence of a mobility edge. Crucial to our experiments is an error mitigation strategy that infers the noiseless output bit string distribution using maximum-likelihood estimation. Compared to post-selection, this method removes systematic errors and reduces statistical uncertainty by up to a factor of 5. We extend our methods to the many-particle regime by developing a quantum algorithm for preparing quasiparticle wavepackets in a one-dimensional model of interacting fermions. This technique has modest quantum resource requirements, making wavepacket-based studies of transport in many-body systems a promising application for near-term quantum computers."}

We consider a physically motivated model in which each party performs homodyne detection and digitizes the continuous outcome via a fixed periodic binning, corresponding to logical Pauli measurements. Within this framework, we derive a bipartite no-go: CHSH cannot be violated for Bell-pair states. Moving beyond two parties, we show that finitely squeezed GKP-encoded GHZ and W states nevertheless exhibit strong multipartite nonlocality, violating multipartite Bell inequalities with homodyne-only readout. We quantify the required squeezing thresholds and robustness to loss, providing a route toward homodyne-based Bell tests in continuous-variable systems."}

The FETs were electrically characterized over a range of drain source biases $V_{ds}= 0$ to $-15V$ and gate voltages,$V_{gs}= +3$ to $-9V$ followed by in situ widefield NV magnetometry during device operation. Magnetic field maps and reconstructed current density distributions directly visualize current injection at the source drain contacts and transport beneath the hBN gated channel. Magnetic field maps reveal current density variations in the channel region owing to non-uniformities or defects in the gate dielectric. In addition, we observe a pronounced enhancement of the drain current ($\\sim 600-900 μA$) and a shift in the apparent threshold voltage during laser illumination, reflecting photo induced changes in channel electrostatics. By correlating gate dependent magnetic images with simultaneous electrical measurements, we directly link spatial current distributions to FET transfer characteristics, providing new insight into buried interface transport and non-uniform gating effects in the transistor channel. As the methodology is compatible with top gated FETs, it can be used to map channel current distributions with micrometer resolution in emerging channel materials, such as 2D materials and wide bandgap channels, and establish widefield NV magnetometry as a powerful platform for probing charge transport in transistors and Van der Waals dielectric heterostructures."}
