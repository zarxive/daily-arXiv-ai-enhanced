Alternatively, plaquette ring exchange can also generate pairing, albeit with a distinct diagonal $d$-wave pairing symmetry.

We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation.

In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing.

The rate at which ground-state domains nucleate from fluctuations in the metastable phase follows an Arrhenius law, with an exponential factor determined by a saddle-point configuration of the energy functional -- the critical droplet -- and a magnitude fixed by small fluctuations of this configuration. We evaluate both contributions over the full parameter space, using a Gel'fand-Yaglom approach to reduce the calculation of the fluctuation spectrum to an initial value problem. In addition, we obtain a closed-form expression for the critical droplet in the limit of small potential tilts, and use it to formulate an effective theory of domain nucleation and growth as a Kramers escape problem for the droplet size.

In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference.

These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cNext-Generation\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea2shift\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u786e\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9ad8\u7ea2shift\u7684\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u65e9\u671f\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1(NPE)\u7ed3\u5408Dingo-IS-a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u6d41\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u53ccL\u578bET\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u548cCE\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0 improve\uff1b2L MisA\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e09\u89d2ET\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46CE\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u7406\u9009\u62e9\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u914d\u7f6e\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aXG\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity.

The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime.

While matter ranges widely from atoms, particles, to solids, photons are predominantly in a confined physical space, such as a pair of mirrors, for enhanced photon-matter interactions known as cavity QED. Since position and momentum are canonically conjugate variables governed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, a fundamental question arises - what if light confinement is in the not-so-intuitive momentum or reciprocal space? The realization of photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) has made possible this exotic scenario. Here, we summarize the most recent advancements at this research frontier in optics and photonics, covering weak coupling, strong coupling, and nonlinear optics. We can designate such photon-matter interactions enabled by reciprocal light confinement through BICs with truly open systems as reciprocal QED, which holds great promise to comprehend and extend cavity QED for optics, photonics, and related fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Recent advancements in reciprocal light confinement in cavity QED show promise for new insights into photon-matter interactions.", "motivation": "Understanding exotic scenarios in light confinement and their impact on photon-matter interactions.", "method": "Review of recent research and analysis of weak, strong, and nonlinear couplings in cavity QED.", "result": "Experiments and simulations demonstrate reciprocal QED effects in photonic systems.", "conclusion": "Reciprocal QED offers new avenues for advancing cavity QED and related fields in optics and photonics."}}

The calculations show that Q varies in the range from 0.62 to 3.61. An example of the practical use of the CH3CHO and CH3OH lines tracing the same regions in three molecular clouds, located at large galactocentric distances (D_GC ~ 8 kpc) is considered. This results in a limit on the mu variations of Delta mu/mu = (0.1 +/- 0.4)*10^(-7) which is in line with previously obtained most stringent upper limits on changes in mu based on other molecules and methods.

Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7535\u8377\u6cf5\u507f\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u6cf5\u507f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u6d4b\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u81ea\u65cb\u54c8\u68ee\u6001\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fd0\u8f93\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7269\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e00\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7535\u8377\u6cf5\u507f\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u6027\u4e86\u89e3\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8f68\u9053\u8fd1\u90bbHamiltonians\u7684\u65f6\u53d8Schr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u5706\u504f\u632f\u7535\u573a\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cf5\u507f\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u660e\u4e86\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u6cf5\u507f\u7684\u673a\u7406\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u9053\u6781\u5316\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u5176\u65b9\u5411\u7531\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u5947\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e00\u7ef4\u6676\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6cf5\u507f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a8\u6d4b\u5076\u7ef4\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u81ea\u65cb\u54c8\u68ee\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u81ea\u65cb-\u8f68\u9053\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn. The paper addresses potential misconceptions about the Alcubierre warp-drive due to inaccuracies in representing spacetime curvature changes and clarifies the classification of the Alcubierre spacetime, emphasizing its distinction from class $B$ warped product spacetimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86Alcubierre\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6807\u91cf\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u91cfI\u3001\u8ff9R\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u9000\u8c03Ricci\u5f20\u91cf\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u4e8c\u6b21\u548c\u4e09\u6b21\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9bRicci\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\u8868\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5c42\u72b6\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5f20\u91cf\u6765\u8425\u9020\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u5c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86Kretschmann\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u6279\u8bc4\u4e86Mattingly\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\u9057\u6f0f\u4e868\u523016\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5c06Alcubierre\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u540c\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6728\u661fSaturn\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eAlcubierre\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e38\u89c1\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u66f2\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86Alcubierre\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5b83\u4e0e\u7c7bB warped\u4e58\u79ef\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4e86\u89e3\u5728Alcubierre\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u66f2\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97Alcubierre\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9000\u8c03Ricci\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f20\u91cf\u6765\u5173\u8054\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u5c55\u793a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u72b6\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5f20\u91cf\u6765\u751f\u6210\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u5c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5176\u65f6\u7a7a\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u5177\u6709\u540c\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6728\u661fSaturn\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0cAlcubierre\u84b8\u6c14\u7403\u822a\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5c42\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The performances and the essential physical parameters of STE devices are linked to the dielectric properties of the constituent materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is an effective tool to measure these properties, but conventional analysis struggles with thin or complex multilayered systems due to simplifying approximations or complex transfer functions. In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research.", "AI": {"tldr": "A practical method for extracting dielectric properties of spintronic terahertz (ST) multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) has been developed, which enhances THz-TDS analysis and facilitates ST design and optimization.", "motivation": "This work aims to address limitations in conventional THz-TDS analysis for complex multilayered systems by introducing the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) for more accurate dielectric property extraction and design optimization of ST devices.", "method": "The authors employ the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) to calculate THz pulse transmission through ST multilayers and compare it with experimental measurements.

Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array.

As a leading platform, neutral atom arrays rely on atomic fluorescence imaging for qubit readout, requiring short exposure, low photon count schemes to mitigate heating and atom loss while enabling mid-circuit feedback. However, a fundamental challenge arises in the single-photon regime where severe overlap in state distributions causes conventional threshold discrimination to fail. Here, we report an AI-accelerated Bayesian inference method for fluorescence readout in neutral atom arrays. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to achieve reliable state detection at the single-photon level under short exposure. Specifically, we introduce a weakly anchored Bayesian scheme that requires calibration of only one state, addressing asymmetric calibration challenges common across quantum platforms. Furthermore, acceleration is achieved via a permutation-invariant neural network, which yields a 100-fold speedup by compressing iterative inference into a single forward pass. The approach achieves relative readout fidelity above 99% and 98% for histogram overlaps of 61% and 72%, respectively, enabling reliable extraction of Rabi oscillations and Ramsey interference results unattainable with conventional threshold based methods. This framework supports scalable, real-time readout of large atom arrays and paves the way toward AI-enhanced quantum technology in computation and sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684AI\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684 fluorescence\u8bfb\u51fa\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u77ed\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4e\u7684 photon\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u6bb5\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u70ed\u548c\u4e22\u5931\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u951a\u5b9a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc799%\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8bfb\u51fa\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684 fluorescence \u8bfb\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8bfb\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u951a\u5b9a\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u77ed\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4f4e\u7684 photon \u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 AI \u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bfb\u51fa\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 readout \u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7 99% \u548c 98% \u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6 Rabi \u632f\u52a8\u548c Ramsey \u5e72\u6d89\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u5927\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86 AI \u52a0\u901f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8bfb\u51fa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,\u03b2} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $\u03b2$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient.

The investigation focuses on understanding the relationship between these interface states and the end states (ESs) of the individual AGNR segments, which are further characterized by their chirality types (A or B). The study is particularly aimed at exploring how translational symmetry affects the electronic properties of the system, such as the number and chirality of the interface states, by introducing a complex heterostructure where the constituent segments exhibit $R_1$ or $R_2$ type unit cells. Additionally, the paper examines the role of the Stark effect in lifting the degeneracy of end states, thereby enabling a clear separation between these states and the interface states. The research also proposes a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach to understand the hybridization of opposite-chirality states, the shift of these states out of the bulk gap, and the determination of the number and chirality of interface states based on the difference in the number of end states between the outer and central segments. The findings are further supported by transmission spectra\u8ba1\u7b97, which reveal the presence of a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when the interface states arise from the end states of the central AGNR segment. The paper further employs an Anderson model with effective Coulomb interactions to derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD. Finally, the thermoelectric analysis demonstrates that the TDQD exhibits enhanced nonlinear power output under electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade significantly suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.

The transmission spectra are computed to validate the theoretical predictions, which support the existence of a topological double quantum dot. The authors further employ an Anderson model with effective Coulomb interactions to derive an expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD.

It was also shown that in symmetric AGNRH segments, the number and chirality of interface states are determined by the difference between the end states of the outer and central segments. The calculation of transmission spectra confirmed that the AGNRH hosts a topological double quantum dot when the interface states arise from the end states of the central AGNR segment. The analytical expression derived from the Anderson model accurately predicts the tunneling current through this TDQD, and the thermoelectric analysis revealed that the TDQD exhibits enhanced nonlinear power output under electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade effectively suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage.", "conclusion": "This work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the emergence and topological characteristics of interface states in complex heterostructures consisting of armchair graphene nanoribbons. The investigation highlights the critical role of translational symmetry in determining the number and chirality of interface states. The proposed model successfully predicts the presence of a topological double quantum dot and its inherent properties, offering valuable insights for the design and optimization of novel electronic devices based on such heterostructures. The thermoelectric analysis further demonstrates the potential for these devices to exhibit enhanced nonlinear power output, complemented by Coulomb blockade characteristics. Overall, the study advances our understanding of the electronic properties of asymmetrical and complex heterostructures and provides a foundation for future experimental and device applications."}}

Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $\u03c6^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $\u03c6^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism.

In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs.

The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity.

While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes.

The prototype consists of 563 channels and represents about 10 percent of the final ZDC design in terms of both channel count and detector volume. It was irradiated at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) with a dose equivalent to 10$^{11}$ protons/cm$^2$. We demonstrate that, despite significant radiation damage to the SiPMs and non-uniform degradation across the detector volume, the detector can be successfully calibrated on a channel-by-channel basis using cosmic-ray data. The damage profile, similar to what is expected in the experiment, varies by an order of magnitude or more across the detector. Even for the most heavily damaged channels, the signal-to-noise ratio for a MIP signal remains above 5. This study provides a realistic test of the system's performance under irradiation. It complements previous SiPM-specific irradiation studies and will inform the future operation of the ZDC and other detectors that use SiPM-on-tile technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By combining energy-curvature diagnostics on periodic $N=24$ clusters with a refined characterization based on order parameters and correlation functions for open chains up to $N=144$, we establish a comprehensive phase diagram in the $\u03c6$--$D_z$ plane. We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, N\u00e9el-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including N\u00e9el-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $\u03c6=\\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between N\u00e9el-$z$ and LLRR2.

Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^\u03c6) = R + \u03b1T^\u03c6+ \u03b2(T^\u03c6)^2/2$, in which the parameters $\u03b1$ and $\u03b2$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $\u03b1\\neq 0$ and $\u03b2\\neq 0$, along with the subcases $\u03b1= 0$ and $\u03b2= 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $\u03b1= \u03b2= 0$.

On quantum computers, chemical dynamics can be simulated efficiently using either universal, qubit-only devices or specialized mixed-qudit-boson (MQB) simulators, which natively host electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. Here, we compare the quantum resources required for a qubit-only approach to achieve the same accuracy as an MQB device at simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. We find that MQB simulations require orders-of-magnitude fewer quantum operations than qubit-only simulations, with a one-gate MQB circuit requiring a qubit-equivalent circuit volume of over 400,000 when simulating an isolated molecule, which increases to over ten million when environmental effects are included. These estimates assume perfect qubits and gates, and would increase by additional orders of magnitude if error correction were used for fault tolerance. When errors are small, the advantage of MQB simulators becomes even larger as system size increases.

They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties.

D \\textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states.

Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Black holes decohere quantum states through soft radiation, and Tomita-Takesaki theory extended for this purpose shows that decoherence mimics optimal observer presence within the black hole's interior.", "motivation": "Understanding black hole decoherence and its relation to quantum information is crucial for resolving foundational questions in quantum gravity and black hole information paradox.", "method": "The research extends Tomita-Takesaki theory to include soft radiation states, utilizing methods from unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction.", "result": "The study provides a new framework for the distinguishability of quantum states, particularly in relation to the memory effects of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation.", "conclusion": "This work establishes that decohering environments from black holes perceive the interior as filled with optimal observers, supporting a new understanding of black hole information processes."}}

In contrast to the predominantly thermorefractive noise in silicon photonic platforms, TCCR noise represents a distinct mechanism that becomes critical for applications requiring high frequency stability and phase coherence, including optomechanical sensing, low-phase-noise microwave synthesis, and on-chip quantum squeezing. A quantitative understanding of the deterministic parameters that control TCCR noise is therefore essential for engineering the next generation of low-noise TFLN photonic systems. Here, we identify two dominant contributors to the TCCR noise in TFLN microresonators: material anisotropy and surface states. Material anisotropy results in increased noise for extraordinarily polarized optical modes and leads to a geometry dependent phase noise. Surface-state effects manifest as increased noise in higher-order transverse modes as well as more than 120-fold higher noise in suspended microresonators. Finally, we demonstrate that post-fabrication annealing -- widely used to reduce defect densities and recover crystal quality -- suppresses frequency noise by a factor of 8.2 in cladded microresonators.

Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The R\\&D for the application of PoF in cryogenic environments started at FNAL and BNL (USA) in 2020 to power the Photon Detection System of the DUNE Vertical Drift module. This paper presents the results obtained in the framework of Cryo-PoF project where we developed a single-laser input line system to power an electronic amplifier and the photosensors at cryogenic temperatures.

However, systems that suffer from significant effects of quantum geometry are not limited to flat-band systems; dispersive-band systems also exhibit quantum condensed phases driven by quantum geometry. In this perspective, we provide a transparent account of quantum geometry and its role in correlated electron phases, throughout flat-band and dispersive-band systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Furthermore, we show that this 2-split behavior is also verified in gauge and gravity theories involving higher-dimensional operators, thereby providing additional evidence to its universal character. As a byproduct, we also generalize the transmuting operators to amplitudes in higher-derivative theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $\u03c1$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $\u03c1$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $\u0394\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $\u0394\\mathbb{S}_{\\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

It is found that this scheme performs identically under incident illumination with either radial or azimuthal polarization. For this purpose, we use a focusing lens in combination with a diffractive optical element formed by a computer-generated hologram containing multiple alternate opaque and transparent regions. Based on vector diffraction theory, our analysis shows that the multi-zone amplitude mask redistributes the beam energy, thereby leading to the formation of a hollow beam. The proposed method provides control over the beam width which maintains a uniform dark core size after focusing through the various NA lens across all the higher order modes. Further the width of high intensity ring can be tuned by varying the NA of the focusing lens. This study shows that the proposed method is well suited for trapping particles or atoms while avoiding exposure to high central intensity, enabling improved contrast and resolution, facilitating ring-shaped ablation or heating, guiding atoms through dark regions to minimize thermal effects, and supporting information encoding using orbital angular momentum and other advanced optical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u5706\u67f1\u77e2\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u8154\u5149\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5f84\u5411\u7d22\u5f15p\u4ece1\u52303\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u65b9\u4f4d\u7d22\u5f15l=1\uff0c regardless of \u5165\u5c04\u5149\u7684\u504f\u632f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c \u751f\u6210\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c \u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7126\u955c\u5934\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u5149\u6805\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u590d\u6570\u5149\u6805\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e2\u91cf\u884d\u5c04\u7406\u8bba\uff0c \u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u533a\u57df\u632f\u5e45\u6ee4\u5149\u7247\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7a7a\u8154\u5149\u675f\uff0c \u5e76\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5149\u675f\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6697\u6838\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c \u589e\u52a0\u5149\u5708\u6570\u503c\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u9ad8\u80fd\u73af\u5bbd\uff0c \u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u9897\u7c92\u6216\u539f\u5b50\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c \u9002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73af\u72b6\u5207\u5272\u6216\u52a0\u70ed\uff0c \u907f\u514d\u70ed\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5149\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5149\u675f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u591a\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5fae\u7c92\u6216\u539f\u5b50\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u9ad8\u9636\u5706\u67f1\u77e2\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u805a\u7126\u900f\u955c\u4e0e\u7f16\u7801\u5149\u6805\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u77e2\u91cf\u884d\u5c04\u7406\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u8154\u5149\u675f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002varying p\u4ece1\u52303", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u65e0\u8bba\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u7684\u504f\u632f\u65b9\u5411\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u8154\u5149\u675f\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u7126\u8ddd\u6570\u503c\u80fd\u591f\u8c03\u8282\u9ad8\u80fd\u73af\u7684\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u8bba\u4f55\u79cd\u9ad8\u9636\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u7126\u8ddd\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6697\u6838\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u8154\u5149\u675f\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u5706\u67f1\u77e2\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u7c92\u6216\u539f\u5b50\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u5fae\u5206\u5149\u6805\u9635\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8c03\u8282\u7b80\u4fbf\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moir\u00e9 materials. In this work we develop a general framework for \\emph{topological} charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86(topological) charge-2ne\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece2e\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7535\u8377U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6765\u6784\u9020\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6750\u6599\u5177\u6709\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u7eb2\u7684\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u7684Josephson\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5982\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5c42\u95f4\u5806\u53e0\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7 bulk-edge correspondence \u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u7684 CFT \u548c bulk \u7684 TQFT\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u62d3\u6251\u9636\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u62d3\u6251 Charge-2ne \u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63a2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u5982quasiparticle interference\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f53\u7cfb\u5982\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5c42\u53e0\u6750\u6599\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u7269\u6001\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5982\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u7eb2\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u7684Josephson\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5df2\u77e5\u7684 Charge-2e \u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u7535\u8377U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u6784\u9020 Charge-2ne \u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u5229\u7528 bulk-edge correspondence \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u7684 CFT \u548c bulk \u7684 TQFT\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Charge-2ne \u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u5e76-pointer\uff1aPost your input after the colon.

Critical points are treated as topological defects, allowing us to assign a winding number to each black hole branch and compute the global topological invariant W. The system exhibits a duality governed by its Maxwell charge Q: for large Q it falls into the class W = 1, displaying van der Waals-type behavior with a first-order small-large black hole transition. For small Q, it shifts to W = 0, characteristic of a Hawking-Page transition. This topological classification provides a model-independent validation of the conventional thermodynamic analysis. Crucially, we find that the non-minimal coupling lambda stabilizes the Hawking-Page universality class W=0 for black holes with non-zero charge, a phenomenon absent in the standard Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS case.

Dual to its spatial counterpart, the temporal gauge field induces a pseudo-electric field for optical pulses, leading to the spin-dependent longitudinal shift and Zitterbewegung for both trajectory and frequency. In addition, we analyze the temporal non-Abelian interference effect induced by temporally bounded non-Abelian gauge field media, which results in the temporal spin-precession and the temporal analogy of the non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$.

We develop a hybrid numerical framework to signify nonperturbative effects on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background sourced by primordial curvature perturbations, focusing on the acoustic channel (fluid motions). Fully general-relativistic, spherically symmetric simulations are used to extract nonperturbative sound-shell profiles from isolated curvature peaks; these profiles are then embedded into three-dimensional lattice evolutions of relativistic hydrodynamics coupled to transverse-traceless metric perturbations to compute the acoustic GW spectra. The acoustic signal has a peak frequency determined by the comoving shell thickness, and its amplitude is extremely sensitive to the mean comoving separation of peaks, scaling approximately as $R_{*c}^{-7}$. We find a robust causal low-frequency tail $\\propto k^{3}$, and the nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions can enhance the ultraviolet power.

In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for achieving unidirectional field-free orientation by selectively manipulating two specific rotational states of symmetric top molecules. By leveraging the interplay between coherent superpositions and the precise selection of initial states, we demonstrate that both the maximum achievable orientation and its direction can be effectively controlled.

This work presents the development of a robust DC spectroscopic system based on electro-optical (EO) frequency comb generators and difference frequency generation (DFG), specifically designed for the characterization of laboratory flames. Operating at a center wavelength of 3427.43 nm, the system utilizes a differential detection strategy to enable precise, calibration-free measurements of unburned methane ($\\mathrm{CH_{4}}$) concentrations in a McKenna burner. The experimental results demonstrate a detection limit of 1.1 ppm for a 1 m path length and effectively resolve spatial concentration gradients across the combustion region. Furthermore, the system's high temporal resolution allowed for the identification of dynamic combustion instabilities, including self-sustained pulsations and fuel leakage under fuel-lean conditions. These findings validate the proposed EO architecture as a flexible and highly sensitive tool for advanced flame characterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5149\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9891\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u8c31\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7532\u70f7\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6781\u9650\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Combustion diagnostics\u5728\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u5982\u53cc\u9891\u8c31\u56e0\u5176\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u65e0\u6821\u51c6\u8981\u6c42\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u706b\u7130\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u53cc\u9891\u8c31\u7cfb\u7edf\u7591\u8651\u91cd\u91cd\u4f46\u503c\u5f97\u6295\u5165\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7535\u5149\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9891\u7387\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u706b\u7130\u7528\u4e8e\u7532\u70f7\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57283427.43 nm\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6ce2\u957f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5dee\u5206\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6821\u51c6\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6355\u83b7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u71c3\u70e7\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u9650\u5236\u4e3a1.1 ppm\uff0c\u5e76\u57281m\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548 resolve \u71c3\u70e7\u533a\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u71c3\u70e7\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u6301\u8109\u52a8\u548c\u71c3\u6599\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u706b\u7130\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u5149\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u706b\u7130\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7532\u70f7\u6d53\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6355\u83b7\u71c3\u70e7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u706b\u7130\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\\frac\u03b1{4}{\\cal G}$ ($\\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $\u03b1$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities.

By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters \u03b1 and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry.

One recently proposed method makes use of ancilla qubits and controlled unitary operators to implement weak measurements related to imaginary-time evolution. In this work we specialize and extend this approach to the setting of combinatorial optimization. We first generalize the algorithm from exact to approximate optimization, taking advantage of several properties unique to classical problems. In particular we show how to select parameters such that the success probability of each measurement step is bounded away from $1/2$. We then show how to adapt our paradigm to the setting of constrained optimization for a number of important classes of hard problem constraints. For this we compare and contrast both penalty-based and feasibility-preserving approaches, elucidating the significant advantages of the latter approach. Our approach is general and may be applied to easy-to-prepare initial states as a standalone algorithm, or deployed as a quantum postprocessing stage to improve performance of a given parameterized quantum circuit. We then propose a more sophisticated variant of our algorithm that adaptively applies a mixing operator or not, based on the measurement outcomes seen so far, as to speeds up the algorithm and helps the system evolution avoid slowing down or getting stuck suboptimally. In particular, we show that mixing operators from the quantum alternating operator ansatz can be imported directly, both for the necessary eigenstate scrambling operator and for initial state preparation, and discuss quantum resource tradeoffs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86\u7ec7\u7269\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u53d8\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u6f14\u5316\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u5e7a\u6b63\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f31\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u60e9\u7f5a\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d8\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\u52a0\u901f\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In a two-port (single-channel-per-side) description, we derive closed-form conditions for (i) canceling back-reflection toward the transmitter and (ii) maximizing the net extracted power at the receiver side. In the lossless limit these conditions imply unit transmitter-to-receiver efficiency (all transmitter power is routed to the receiver side) even when the barrier is nearly opaque under one-sided illumination. We validate the concept using (1) an analytically solvable high-index Fabry--P\u00e9rot slab and (2) a numerically simulated perforated PEC metasurface exhibiting vanishing one-sided transmission; in both cases, coherent assistance yields near-unity transmission and large enhancement factors. We further analyze dissipative barriers using a receiver-side energy-balance metric, showing that substantial net delivery can persist well into the lossy regime.

In this paper, we construct new three-family flux models in the Type IIB setup on $\\mathbb{T}^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, T-dual to the Type IIA rigid D6-brane construction with discrete torsion, by introducing the quantized background $G_3$ flux that stabilizes the closed-string complex structure moduli and axio-dilaton. The resulting Pati-Salam gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken down to the Standard Model via a supersymmetry-preserving Higgs mechanism.

We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors.

Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact.

It is a scalable variational framework that maintains a constant number of trainable parameters regardless of the number of qubits, Hamiltonian complexity, or circuit depth. By separating schedule function optimization from circuit digitization, FPC-QAOA enables accurate schedule approximations with minimal parameters while supporting arbitrarily deep digitized adiabatic evolutions, constrained only by NISQ hardware capabilities. This separation allows depth to scale without expanding the classical search space, mitigating overparameterization and optimization challenges typical of deep QAOA circuits, such as barren plateaus-like behaviors. We benchmark FPC-QAOA on random MaxCut instances and the Tail Assignment Problem, achieving performance comparable to or better than standard QAOA with nearly constant classical effort and significantly fewer quantum circuit evaluations. Experiments on the IBM Kingston superconducting processor with up to 50 qubits confirm robustness and hardware efficiency under realistic noise.

The holographic tEE is realized through extremal surfaces consisting of spacelike and timelike branches that encode its real and imaginary components, respectively. In the BTZ black hole, these surfaces extend into the interior of the black hole and reproduce the field-theoretic results. The analysis is further generalized to higher-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the characteristics of tEE are obtained with increasing size of the boundary subsystem. Besides, we also show that the boundary subsystem length diverges at a dimension-dependent critical turning point. Notably, this critical point moves closer to the black hole horizon as the dimensionality of the bulk increases. For large subsystem lengths, the finite part of the tEE displays a characteristic volume-plus-area structure, with a real volume term and a complex coefficient of the area term approaching constant values at large dimensions. Besides, we also study the monotonicity of a new quantity, timelike entanglement density, which offers insights into a timelike area theorem in specific limits. Subsequently, we investigate the near-horizon dynamics in various black hole backgrounds, where the spacelike and timelike surfaces exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{\\frac{2\u03c0}\u03b2

A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave gates and, therefore, strong static couplings, is suppressing parasitic interactions that extend beyond nearest neighbors to include next-nearest elements. We address this issue by introducing several design strategies: the frequency allocation of both qubits and couplers, the localization of coupler wavefunctions, and a differential oscillator that suppresses residual long-range interactions. In addition, the architecture natively supports fast $\\sim70$~ns CZZ gates -- three-qubit operations composed of two CZ gates sharing a common qubit -- which reduce the incoherent error by $\\sim 35\\%$ compared to performing the corresponding CZs sequentially.

Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space. More generally, we also discuss superpositions of ``higher-order squeezed states'', including tri-squeezed and quad-squeezed states. All these states involve superpositions of multiples of $p$ photons.

This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our construction is based on the quantum Schur transform and the quantum Fourier transform over the symmetric group. By using the efficient construction of these quantum transforms, we can implement the random dilation superchannel with the circuit complexity $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n, \\log d_I, \\log d_O))$, where $n$ is the number of queries and $d_I$ and $d_O$ are the input and output dimensions of the input channel, respectively. As an application, we show an efficient storage-and-retrieval of an unknown quantum channel, which improves the program cost exponentially in the retrieval error $\\varepsilon$. For the case where the Kraus rank $r$ is the least possible (i.e., $r = d_I/d_O$), we show quantum circuits transforming $n$ parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel $\u039b$ to $\u0398(n^\u03b1)$ parallel queries of $\u039b$ for any $\u03b1<2$ approximately, and its Petz recovery map for the reference state given by the maximally mixed state probabilistically and exactly.

The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical nature of the vdPo's state directly from the tomogram without requiring full state reconstruction or the Wigner function negativity. Within a well-defined parameter regime of drive strength and detuning, both $\u03b4$ and $g^{(2)}(0)$ exhibit pronounced signatures of synchronization that complements the phase coherence between the drive and the vdPo. We derive an analytical expression for the steady-state density matrix and the corresponding tomogram of the system, valid for arbitrary strengths of the harmonic drive. Analysis of the quantum tomogram uncovers clear phase-locking behavior, enabling the identification of the synchronization region (Arnold tongue) directly in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, the behaviour of $g^{(2)}(0)$ provides a statistical perspective that reinforces the tomographic signatures of QS. By analyzing the interplay between these metrics, we can gain more profound insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern QS in such systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For a given arbitrary bipartite initial state and a desired bipartite target state, we construct an optimized local quantum channel that transforms the initial state into the target state with high fidelity. To achieve this goal, local quantum channels are parametrized on a complex Stiefel manifold and optimized using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances entanglement distillation for weakly entangled states via two complementary strategies: optimized local state transformation and probabilistic local transformation. These results establish our method as a powerful and versatile tool for a broad class of quantum information processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd Lokal \u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f31\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u7ea0\u7f20\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7ea0\u7f20\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684 Stiefel \u6d41\u5f62\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5c40\u90e8\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u4f18\u5316\u7684 Lokal \u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027 Lokal \u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f31\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u7cbe\u70bc\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ea0\u7f20\u7cbe\u70bc\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}
