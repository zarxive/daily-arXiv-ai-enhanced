TL;DR: This paper advances on-chip optical frequency division (OFD) technology by integrating a PZT stress-optic actuator into a microcomb, achieving tunable frequencies for low-noise mmWave generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the challenge of integrating optical frequency division (OFD) into on-chip systems to leverage low-noise microwave and millimeter-wave signals.

Method: They use an integrated PZT actuator in a SiN soliton microcomb to precisely control frequency, enabling tunable OFD capabilities without disrupting the system.

Result: They successfully develop an on-chip OFD oscillator, integrating a microcomb with a reference cavity for high precision.

Conclusion: This approach offers a versatile and stable solution for advanced applications requiring precise timing and communication.

Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) produces low-noise microwave and
millimeter-wave signals by transferring the exceptional stability of optical
references to electronic frequency domains. Recent developments in integrated
optical references and soliton microcombs have paved the way for miniaturizing
OFD oscillators to chip scale. Critical to this realization is a rapid tunable
frequency comb that is stabilized to the optical references, thereby coherently
linking optical and electronic frequencies. In this work, we advance the
on-chip OFD technology using an integrated high-speed PZT stress-optic actuator
on the SiN soliton microcomb resonator. The integrated PZT actuator tunes the
resonance frequency of the soliton-generating microresonator with a bandwidth
exceeding 10s MHz and independently adjusts the soliton repetition rate without
perturbing the frequency comb offset. Optical frequency division and low-noise
mmWave generation are demonstrated by feedback control of the soliton
repetition rate through the integrated PZT-actuator, and the soliton microcomb
is stabilized to a pair of reference lasers that are locked to an integrated
4-meter SiN coil reference cavity. Our approach provides a fast, versatile and
integrated control mechanism for OFD oscillators and their applications in
advanced communications, sensing, and precise timing.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables BTO-based photonics to be a next-gen material for high-performance integrated optical devices with advantages in miniaturization and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) has been experiencing a surge of interest for
integrated photonics technologies because of its large nonlinear optical
coefficients, especially the Pockels coefficient, and in part due to newly
available thin-film substrates. In this work, we report on the development of a
redeposition-free dry etching technique for monolithic BTO-on-insulator
photonics, that produces very low-roughness and high-verticality waveguides.
Using this, we experimentally demonstrate the first BTO microresonators with
intrinsic Q-factor $> 1$ million, and waveguide propagation loss as small as
0.32 dB/cm, representing the lowest losses reported in any BTO-based integrated
platform to date. We additionally demonstrate Mach-Zehnder amplitude modulators
with $V_{\pi}L = 0.54$ V$\cdot$cm and effective electro-optic coefficient
$r_\text{eff} = 162$ pm/V.

Abstract: Silicon nitride Dissipative Kerr Soliton (DKS) microcombs have emerged as a
future solution to bring metrological optical frequency comb capabilities into
a photonic integrated platform with mass-scale fabrication benefits. Precision
applications demand low comb line phase noise as well as high repetition rate
stability, but current approaches to achieve this involve complex
architectures, multiple lasers, and high-power components, which are
challenging to integrate to the chip scale. To achieve this goal, new
architectures are needed to simplify the comb generation, actuation, and pump
laser requirements, while enabling chip-integrated solutions. Here we
demonstrate a greatly simplified stabilized DKS comb architecture with a single
laser and a single point electronic control of both the microcomb generation
and its stabilization to a coil-resonator reference. The silicon nitride
microcomb is integrated with a low power, broadband PZT actuator that is driven
by a simple electronic control sequence that generates a soliton and stabilizes
it to the 16-meter silicon nitride coil resonator. PZT-enabled control brings
flexibility and simplicity to the soliton generation and stabilization using a
single CW pump laser, resulting in significantly reduced electronic and optical
infrastructure. We demonstrate coil-resonator locking which suppresses the 1
kHz frequency noise by 40 dB over the 35 nm wide comb spectrum, with comb line
linewidths as low as 66 Hz and 108 GHz soliton repetition rate phase noise
equivalent to -118 dBc/Hz when divided down to 10 GHz. The low power PZT
actuator consumes nW bias power and the coil resonator allows flexible dual
locking using arbitrary comb lines. These results show a clear path towards
full chip integration of stabilized soliton microcombs with simplicity and
versatility absent in other schemes.

presented, and deuterated SiN emerges as a good candidate for ultralow loss (<
0.1 dB/cm) and reliability by simple 8-inch process with low thermal budget.

TL;DR:  paper proposes a robust system for generating soliton microcombs using PMFs and active temperature control. They address environmental sensitivity and instability, achieving high coupling efficiency and long-term stability. Comparative experiments show improved performance over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  researching soliton microcomb generation and wanting a more reliable and compact system for real-world applications.

Method:  direct coupling using high-NA PMFs and active temperature control, with precision alignment removed for simplicity. Performances tested under environmental changes.

Result:  achieved 57.7% coupling efficiency, sustained soliton operation for over 24 hours, reduced wavelength variation by 79% and 97%. PMF-based better than existing systems in stability and noise immunity.

Conclusion:  This system provides a scalable and reliable solution for compact photonic sources, suitable for portable and dynamic environments.

Abstract: We propose a compact and robust system architecture for soliton microcomb
generation, based on two key techniques: direct fiber coupling using high
numerical-aperture polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers (high-NA PMFs)
and active temperature control of the microresonator. These complementary
strategies address two major challenges in microcomb implementation:
environmental sensitivity and resonance instability. Building on prior work
using single-mode fiber (SMF)-based direct coupling, which demonstrated device
miniaturization and partial suppression of thermal drift in coupling
efficiency, our PMF-based approach offers enhanced thermal stability and
significantly greater robustness to environmental disturbances such as
temperature fluctuations and vibration. In our system, precision alignment
using microscopes or multi-axis stages is no longer required, enabling a
simplified optical setup and stable long-term operation. The direct coupling
scheme achieved a coupling efficiency of 57.7% and maintained soliton operation
for over 24 hours under external perturbations. In parallel, active temperature
control of the microresonator was quantitatively evaluated, reducing the
wavelength variation of the pump and auxiliary lasers by 79% and 97%,
respectively. This stability enables reproducible soliton generation even in
thermally dynamic environments. Comparative experiments with SMF-based direct
coupling and lensed-SMF-based free-space coupling systems confirmed the
superior performance of the PMF-based design in terms of coupling stability,
soliton lifetime, and immunity to environmental noise. The architecture
developed in this study lays a strong foundation for future integration into
compact modules, paving the way for portable and robust microcomb sources in
real-world photonic systems.

Abstract: Femtosecond (fs) laser sintering enables ultrafast and spatially localized
energy deposition, making it attractive for additive manufacturing of metal
nanoparticles. However, undesired ablation during fs irradiation of copper (Cu)
nanoparticles often disrupts uniform sintering, and the underlying ablation
mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the
fragmentation and coalescence behavior of Cu nanoparticles subjected to fs
laser scanning under fluence conditions relevant to sintering applications.
Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy reveal
a bimodal transformation: emergence of sub-60\,nm debris and formation of large
aggregates up to 750 nm. We evaluate two candidate mechanisms -- Coulomb
explosion and hot electron blast -- by estimating electron emission,
electrostatic pressure, and hot electron temperature using the
Richardson--Dushman equation and two-temperature modeling. Our analysis shows
that Coulomb explosion is unlikely under the laser fluence used
($\sim$27\,mJ/cm$^2$), as the estimated electrostatic pressure ($\sim$4 kPa) is
orders of magnitude below the cohesive strength of Cu. In contrast, hot
electron blast is identified as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron
temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa.
Thermal modeling also suggests moderate lattice heating ($\sim$930\,K),
enabling softening and fusion of partially fragmented particles. These results
confirm that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven
predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics rather than classical melting or
evaporation. Importantly, this work highlights that reducing hot electron
temperature -- such as through double-pulse irradiation schemes -- can
effectively suppress ablation and expand the sintering window, offering a
promising strategy for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.

*Haoyu Wang,Yanmin Zhu,Tong Fu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper introduces a compact, single-layer dual-wavelength diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) that significantly outperforms traditional multi-layer networks, achieving high classification accuracy with fewer parameters and demonstrating robustness against noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of conventional multi-layer D2NNs, particularly inter-layer misalignments, and presents a novel approach using wavelength-division multiplexing and differential intensity detection to overcome these issues, aiming to create more efficient and reliable photonic computing architectures.

Method: The researchers developed a single-layer D2NN that encodes complementary spatial frequency information at two distinct wavelengths, exploiting wavelength-division multiplexing. They used differential intensity detection for decoding. Numerical experiments with the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets showed improved performance with reduced parameters.

Result: The network achieved 98.59% accuracy on MNIST and 90.4% on Fashion MNIST using only 40k trainable parameters, surpassing the performance of five-layer D2NNs with 20% fewer parameters. It also maintained strong performance with 10k parameters and was robust against various disturbances.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that single-layer diffractive optical networks can achieve high classification accuracy and serve as a benchmark for more compact, robust photonic computing systems that leverage wavelength diversity and differential detection.

Abstract: Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs), which perform computation using
light instead of electrons, offer a promising pathway toward accelerating
artificial intelligence by leveraging the inherent advantages of optics in
speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency. However, conventional multi-layer
D2NNs suffer from inter-layer misalignments that significantly increase system
complexity and degrade performance, particularly under visible-light operation
where optical alignment is highly sensitive.
  Here, we present a compact, single-layer dual-wavelength differential D2NN
that combines wavelength-division multiplexing with differential intensity
detection to enable high-accuracy all-optical classification while
substantially reducing hardware complexity. By encoding complementary spatial
frequency information at two distinct wavelengths, the proposed network
overcomes non-negativity constraints and feature loss inherent to
single-wavelength systems.
  Our numerical experiments achieve outstanding classification accuracies of
98.59% on MNIST and 90.4% on Fashion MNIST using only 40k trainable parameters
surpassing the performance of conventional five layer D2NNs (91.33% and 83.67%,
respectively) with merely 20% of the parameter count. Furthermore, the network
maintains strong performance with only 10k parameters and demonstrates enhanced
robustness against random phase perturbations, optical occlusions, and input
noise.
  To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of a
single layer diffractive optical network that achieves such high classification
accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for compact, robust, and shallow
photonic computing architectures.

Abstract: Transformation optics establishes an equivalence relationship between
gradient media and curved space, unveiling intrinsic geometric properties of
gradient media. However, this approach based on curved spaces is concentrated
on two-dimensional manifolds, namely curved surfaces. In this Letter, we
establish an intrinsic connection between three-dimensional manifolds and
three-dimensional gradient media in transformation optics by leveraging the
Yamabe problem and Ricci scalar curvature, a measure of spatial curvature in
manifolds. The invariance of the Ricci scalar under conformal mappings is
proven. Our framework is validated through the analysis of representative
conformal optical lenses.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses an advanced method for cooling levitated particles using phase adaptive feedback, which reduces their temperature significantly and enables fiber-integrated quantum manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of ultrasensitive sensors and fundamental physics probing requires precise control of particles at micro and nanoscale, making cooling techniques crucial and innovative.

Method: The approach involves using phase modulation of counterpropagating modes in a hollow-core fiber to adjust the optical phase relative to the particle's axial momentum, generating a dissipative force for cooling without heating.

Result: Achieved effective center-of-mass cooling, reducing temperature to 58.6 K at low pressure and validating with analytical models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a novel cooling method with potential for quantum manipulation in integrated fiber systems, opening new research avenues in metrology and fundamental physics.

Abstract: Active feedback cooling of levitated dielectric particles is a pivotal
technique for creating ultrasensitive sensors and probing fundamental physics.
Here we demonstrate phase-adaptive feedback cooling of silica nanoparticles
optically trapped in standing-wave potential formed by two co-linearly
polarized counterpropagating diffraction-free guided modes in a hollow-core
photonic crystal fiber at room temperature. Unlike standard laser intensity- or
Coulomb force-based feedback, our approach modulates the relative optical phase
between the counterpropagating fundamental modes proportionally to the
particle's axial momentum. This generates a Stokes-like dissipative force which
effectively damps the center-of-mass motion without introducing excess heating
and can also work with uncharged particles. At 2 mbar air pressure, the axial
center-of-mass temperature of a 195 nm silica particle is reduced by half upon
application of the feedback and to 58.6 K at 0.5 mbar. The measured mechanical
spectra agree well with our analytical model, validating the cooling mechanism.
We envision this approach will open up pathways towards long-range, coherent
control of mesoscopic particles inside hollow-core fibers, offering a
fiber-integrated versatile platform for future quantum manipulation.

TL;DR:  paper proposes an FPGA-based solution for high-purity germanium detectors (HPgTPCs) used in neutrino experiments like DUNE, which are cheaper and more efficient than existing technologies. The system showed good noise performance while being deformable to different operating conditions, making it a promising and cost-effective alternative for next-gen detectors. Still, some cooling issues were found needing further improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about improving neutrino detectors that are crucial for long-term physics experiments like DUNE. Given that neutrino experiments require high precision and cost-effectiveness, the authors propose and evaluate a novel FPGA-based system designed specifically for these detectors, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the field by offering a more affordable and efficient solution compared to traditional readout electronics.

Method: The methodology includes designing and optimizing an FPGA-based system for ND-GAr in the Phase-II more capable near detector. The authors utilized atmospheric pressure testing up to 4.5 barA with various gas mixtures and tested the system operation between April and July 2024.

The ability to adapt to diverse operating conditions through gas mixture and pressure variations suggests the system's flexibility and scalability. Furthermore, the system's cost-effectiveness, achieved through optimizing the number of FPGAs used, was highlighted, showing it as a viable and economical alternative to conventional readout electronics utilized in high-occupancy collider environments.

Conclusion: The paper successfully presents a feasible and cost-efficient FPGA-based system tailored for high-purity germanium detectors, which are essential for experiments like DUNE. By reducing costs while maintaining high performance, the proposed solution contributes significantly to advancing neutrino physics research with more accessible and efficient technologies.

Abstract: HPgTPCs have benefits such as low energy threshold, magnetisability, and
4$\pi$ acceptance, making them ideal for neutrino experiments such as DUNE. We
present the design of an FPGA-based solution optimised for ND-GAr, which is
part of the Phase-II more capable near detector for DUNE. These electronics
reduce the cost significantly compared to using collider readout electronics
which are typically designed for much higher occupancy and therefore, for
example, need much larger numbers of FPGAs and power per channel. We
demonstrate the performance of our electronics with the TOAD at Fermilab in the
US at a range of pressures and gas mixtures up to 4.5barA, reading out ~10000
channels from a multi-wire proportional chamber. The operation took place
between April and July of 2024. We measure the noise characteristics of the
system to be sufficiently low and we identify sources of noise that can be
further mitigated in the next iteration. We also note that the cooling scheme
used in the test requires improvement before full-scale deployment. Despite
these necessary improvements, we show that the system can fulfil the needs of a
HPgTPC for a fraction of the price of collider readout electronics.

TL;DR: 该论文详细描述了为Fermilab's IB3A测试设施升级其氦管理系统的方法，旨在减少氦消耗并降低成本。文章分为两个阶段，设计与工程以及采购与安装，解决了 pipe 管道的设计、控制与监测等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为减少氦资源浪费和降低测试成本，Fermilab正在升级IB3A测试设施的氦管理系统，这是一项重要的可持续发展项目。

Method: 该论文详细描述了项目的两个阶段：设计与工程阶段确定了管道规格和控制要求，并解决了与现有 cryo-基础设施的整合问题；采购与安装阶段涉及材料采购、管道搭建和控制系统部署。采用了压力优化、降 migraine loss 和界面兼容性解决技术难题。

Result: 实施该管道和升级IB3A后，氦消耗量将得到显著减少，测试成本降低，同时提高了IB3A的支持前沿科学的能力。

Conclusion: 项目将有效减少氦浪费，降低成本，并增强Fermilab在前沿科学研究中的能力。

Abstract: The growing demand for sustainable cryogenic operations at Fermilab has
underscored the need to improve helium management, particularly at the
Industrial Building 3A (IB3A) test facility. IB3A characterizes and tests
superconductors, cables, and coils for projects such as the HL-LHC AUP and
Mu2e, yet currently relies on 500 L Dewars whose boil-off is vented to
atmosphere, wasting a critical, non-renewable resource and increasing the cost
of testing. A project is therefore under way to link IB3A to an existing
purification and liquefaction station in a neighboring building through a
dedicated pipeline. Captured helium will be transferred, purified, reliquefied,
and returned for reuse, cutting losses and operating costs. This paper details
the first two project phases: "Design and Engineering" and "Procurement and
Installation." The design phase finalizes pipeline specifications, establishes
flow-control requirements, and resolves integration challenges with existing
cryogenic infrastructure. The procurement and installation phase covers
material sourcing, pipeline construction, and deployment of control and
monitoring systems to assure reliable, efficient operation. Key technical
hurdles-route optimization, pressure drop mitigation, and interface
compatibility-are discussed alongside implemented solutions. Implementing the
pipeline and upgrading IB3A will dramatically reduce helium consumption and
therefore testing cost, strengthening Fermilab's capacity to support frontier
science far into the future.

### [17] [Exact downfolding and its perturbative approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16916)
*Jonas B. Profe,Jakša Vučičević,P. Peter Stavropoulos,Malte Rösner,Roser Valentí,Lennart Klebl*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for downfolding in the many-electron problem, connecting it with renormalization group theory and improving the constrained random phase approximation. They demonstrate the framework with examples from materials physics. The work provides a systematic approach for effective model derivation and validation in condensed matter physics. The authors derive exact effective models and present conditions for perturbative approximations, shedding light on cRPA underpinnings and corrections. They validate the method using nickel and cuprate materials, showing its applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics: accurately handling the many-electron problem, which is computationally intensive yet crucial for predicting material properties. By providing a rigorous mathematical approach, the paper bridges theoretical methods and practical applications, potentially enabling more accurate and efficient modeling of materials with complex electron interactions.

Method: The authors start with a formal derivation of an effective model in a target space by integrating out high-energy degrees of freedom. They employ renormalization group techniques and provide conditions for when perturbative truncations are valid. The constrained random phase approximation is revisited within this framework, uncovering its assumptions and highlighting necessary corrections.

Result: The paper presents a mathematically exact approach for effective model derivation, explains when and why perturbative approximations hold, and provides a more solid foundation for understanding the constrained random phase approximation. They validate this through concrete examples in materials physics, demonstrating the method's applicability to real-world problems.

Conclusion: This work offers a new methodological pathway to systematically derive effective models in condensed matter physics, ensuring their validity and guiding the selection of appropriate model spaces. It provides a framework for understanding and improving approximations like the constrained random phase approximation, potentially leading to advancements in both theoretical understanding and practical applications in materials science.

Abstract: Solving the many-electron problem, even approximately, is one of the most
challenging and simultaneously most important problems in contemporary
condensed matter physics with various connections to other fields. The standard
approach is to follow a divide and conquer strategy that combines various
numerical and analytical techniques. A crucial step in this strategy is the
derivation of an effective model for a subset of degrees of freedom by a
procedure called downfolding, which often corresponds to integrating out energy
scales far away from the Fermi level. In this work we present a rigorous
formulation of this downfolding procedure, which complements the
renormalization group picture put forward by Honerkamp [PRB 85, 195129
(2012)}]. We derive an exact effective model in an arbitrarily chosen target
space (e.g. low-energy degrees of freedom) by explicitly integrating out the
the rest space (e.g. high-energy degrees of freedom). Within this formalism we
state conditions that justify a perturbative truncation of the downfolded
effective interactions to just a few low-order terms. Furthermore, we utilize
the exact formalism to formally derive the widely used constrained random phase
approximation (cRPA), uncovering underlying approximations and highlighting
relevant corrections in the process. Lastly, we detail different contributions
in the material examples of fcc Nickel and the infinite-layer cuprate
SrCuO$_2$. Our results open up a new pathway to obtain effective models in a
controlled fashion and to judge whether a chosen target space is suitable.

TL;DR: 研究通过在YBCO7中引入Pr元素来探讨三维电荷有序的微观机制。通过DFT计算发现，Pr在Ba位点最小能量的超级晶格比在Y位点，且Ba位的Pr离子导致压缩模变形，从而将电荷条纹 pinning 到Pr柱，使电荷有序沿c轴排列。而Y位的Pr离子导致膨胀模变形，无法实现类似的条纹 pinning。蒙特卡洛模拟支持条纹相关长度与Pr离子的结构相关长度一致，从而表明Pr引入的结构 pinning 是三维电荷有序的关键机制。这种方法为通过离子替换调控电子状态提供了定量指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者想知道如何通过添加Pr元素来稳定三维电荷有序，可能寻找离子替换的方法，因此需要了解具体机制，以及是否有定量方法来调控电子状态。

Method: 研究采用了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，分析了Pr在不同类型位置（Ba和Y）的超级晶格结构，考察了两种离子大小对晶体结构的影响，利用蒙特卡洛模拟验证了条纹相关性的变化与结构相关性的同步性。

Result: 找到了最小能量的Pr超级晶格结构，发现Ba位的Pr更有效，导致压缩模和条纹 pinning，促使电荷有序沿c轴排列。Y位的Pr则导致膨胀模，无法 pinning，导致结果不同。蒙特卡洛模拟支持理论计算，说明Pr离子的结构 pinning 可能是三维电荷有序的关键因素。

Conclusion: 插入Pr能够通过结构 pinning，特别是Ba位，有效稳定三维电荷有序。方法提供了一种定量的手段，通过离子替换调控电子态。这可能为材料科学中的新超导体材料设计提供指导。

Abstract: We investigate the microscopic mechanisms behind the stabilization of
three-dimensional (3D) charge order by Pr doping in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO7).
Density-functional-theory calculations locate the lowest-energy Pr
superlattices for both Ba- and Y-site substitution. In the Ba-site case, the
smaller Pr ion pulls the surrounding atoms inward. This breathing-mode
distortion pins charge-stripe walls to the Pr columns and forces them to align
along the $c$ axis. Y-site Pr is larger than the host ion, produces an outward
distortion, and fails to pin the stripes. Coarse-grained Monte-Carlo
simulations show that the stripe correlation length rises in step with the
structural correlation length of the Pr dopant as observed in prior
experiments. We thus identify dopant-induced lattice pinning as the key
mechanism behind 3D charge order in Pr-doped YBCO7. This approach provides
quantitative guidelines for engineering electronic orders through targeted
ionic substitution.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study investigates the structural phase transition in kagome metals under orthorhombic distortions using X-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations, proposing a molecular orbital model to explain the transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the mechanism behind the structural phase transition in kagome lattices is crucial due to their exotic properties and high symmetry breaking under orthorhombic distortions.

Method: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and ab initio calculations were used to study the phase transition and validate the proposed model.

Result: The X-ray data supports a transition driven by molecular orbital interactions between the kagome 4d orbitals, consistent with calculations.

Conclusion: The findings propose a molecular orbital formation as the driving force and suggest evaluating material stability based on electronegativity and atomic radii for designing symmetric kagome metals.

Abstract: The kagome lattice, with its inherent frustration, hosts a plethora of exotic
phenomena, including the emergence of $3\mathbf{q}$ charge density wave order.
The high rotational symmetry, required to realize such an unconventional charge
order, is broken in many kagome materials by orthorhombic distortions at high
temperature, the origin of which is much less discussed despite their ubiquity.
In this study, synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals a structural phase
transition from a parent hexagonal phase to an orthorhombic ground state,
mediated by a critical regime of diffuse scattering in the prototypical kagome
metals $R$Ru$_3$Si$_2$ ($R$=rare-earth). Structural analysis uncovers an
interlayer dimerization of kagome atoms in the low-temperature phase.
Accordingly, a dimer model with one-dimensional disorder on kagome layers
successfully reproduces the diffuse scattering. The observations point to
molecular orbital formation between kagome $4d_{z^2}$ orbitals as the driving
force behind the transition, consistent with \textit{ab initio} calculations. A
framework based on electronegativity and atomic radii is proposed to evaluate
the stability of the hexagonal phase in kagome metals, guiding the design of
highly symmetric materials.

TL;DR: 研究显示，光激发的钙钛矿化合物在光激励后形成了一种新的中间时态结构，这种结构在超快和准静态阶段已经观察到，但中间时态阶段的研究进展有限。通过第二谐波光和双折射率测量，发现这种中间时态状态在层间反铁磁顺序融化后出现，属于稳定状态，这扩展了光激发凝聚态研究的前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子材料在光激发下的中间时态状态，这些状态在热不可达的环境中出现，具有结构、电荷、自旋、拓扑和超导性。中间时态通常在从飞秒到皮秒的时间尺度上出现，可以持续几周。目前主要研究了超快和准静态阶段，而中间时态阶段的研究相对不足。

Method: 使用了光激发钙钛矿化合物并对其光激发后的动力学行为进行了研究。主要采用第二谐波光和双折射率测量技术来观察和分析中间时态状态的出现和特性。此外，通过模型 hamiltonian 计算，认为这种状态可能不依赖于热环境，而是通过光激励直接获得。

Result: 光激发后，钙钛矿化合物形成了一种新的中间时态结构，这种状态在光激发之后相对较长时间出现。它表现出与已知平衡态图中不同的性质，可能涉及层间自旋或磁性秩序。第二谐波和双折射率测量结果支持了这一结论。模型计算表明，这种状态可能无需经历热失衡过程，而是通过直接光激发形成。

Conclusion: 光激发的钙钛矿化合物可以在中间时态阶段形成稳定的激发态结构。这种研究扩展了对光致变量子材料的了解，并提示了新的中间时态状态下材料的潜在应用。中间时态阶段可能为设计新型物质和mongeonic材料提供了新思路。

Abstract: Photo-excited quantum materials can be driven into thermally inaccessible
metastable states that exhibit structural, charge, spin, topological and
superconducting orders. Metastable states typically emerge on timescales set by
the intrinsic electronic and phononic energy scales, ranging from femtoseconds
to picoseconds, and can persist for weeks. Therefore, studies have primarily
focused on ultrafast or quasi-static limits, leaving the intermediate time
window less explored. Here we reveal a metastable state with broken glide-plane
symmetry in photo-doped Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ using time-resolved optical
second-harmonic generation and birefringence measurements. We find that the
metastable state appears long after intralayer antiferromagnetic order has
melted and photo-carriers have recombined. Its properties are distinct from all
known states in the equilibrium phase diagram and are consistent with
intralayer ferromagnetic order. Furthermore, model Hamiltonian calculations
reveal that a non-thermal trajectory to this state can be accessed via
photo-doping. Our results expand the search space for out-of-equilibrium
electronic matter to metastable states emerging at intermediate timescales.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with boundaries differ in classification from fully periodic systems, challenging the standard anomaly inflow approach and impacting the crystalline equivalence principle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to explore the difference in SPT classifications between boundary systems and periodic systems, which could have significant implications in condensed matter physics and the understanding of phase transitions.

Method: The paper uses abstract theoretical analysis, possibly examining mathematical models and symmetry considerations to compare SPT phases in different boundary conditions.

Result: The main result is that SPT phases with boundaries don't align 1-to-1 with those in fully periodic systems, suggesting that the anomaly inflow interpretation may not hold, conflicting with previous assumptions.

Conclusion: The conclusion states that this finding challenges previous Understandings and calls for revised theories on the CEP, emphasizing that boundary conditions fundamentally alter the classification of SPT phases.

Abstract: We show how weak symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases on systems with
a boundary are not in 1-to-1 correspondence with weak SPT phases on fully

Abstract: The phenomenon of Mott insulation involves the localization of itinerant
electrons due to strong local repulsion. Upon doping, a pseudogap (PG) phase
emerges - marked by selective gapping of the Fermi surface without conventional
symmetry breaking in spin or charge channels. A key challenge is understanding
how quasiparticle breakdown in the Fermi liquid gives rise to this enigmatic
state, and how it connects to both the Mott insulating and superconducting
phases. Here, we develop a renormalization-based construction of strongly
correlated lattice models that captures the emergence of the pseudogap phase
and its transition to a Mott insulator. Applying a many-body tiling scheme to
the fixed-point impurity model uncovers a lattice model with electron
interactions and Kondo physics. At half-filling, the interplay between Kondo
screening and bath charge fluctuations in the impurity model leads to Fermi
liquid breakdown. This reveals a pseudogap phase characterized by a non-Fermi
liquid (the Mott metal) residing on nodal arcs, gapped antinodal regions of the
Fermi surface, and an anomalous scaling of the electronic scattering rate with
frequency. The eventual confinement of holon-doublon excitations of this exotic
metal obtains a continuous transition into the Mott insulator. Our results
identify the pseudogap as a distinct long-range entangled quantum phase, and
offer a new route to Mott criticality beyond the paradigm of local quantum
criticality.

TL;DR: FePS3 crystals exhibit strong spin-lattice coupling with pronounced in-plane anisotropy in its magnetic and phonon excitations. The magnon modes show redshifting and splitting with temperature and magnetic fields, respectively. Optically detected magnons and infrared phonons further support spin-phonon interaction and inversion symmetry breaking in the magnetically ordered state, making FePS3 a model system for studying spin-lattice interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom is crucial in condensed matter physics, especially in 2D antiferromagnetic materials. FePS3 is a promising candidate for such studies due to its magnetic properties and potential for hosting exotic spin states.

Method: The study used temperature-dependent polarized transmission spectroscopy and Faraday rotation measurements to analyze the magneto-optical properties of FePS3 single crystals. Optical conductivity and Drude-Lorentz modeling were applied to extract magnon modes and understand polarization sensitivity. Raman-active modes and phonon contributions in Faraday rotation provided evidence for spin-phonon coupling and symmetry breaking.

Result: The findings show that FePS3 exhibits significant spin-lattice coupling with anisotropic magnon modes that shift with temperature and split under magnetic fields. The presence of optically detected magnons and Raman-active phonons confirms spin-phonon interactions and inversion symmetry breaking, positioning FePS3 as a key model system for studying spin-lattice interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.

Conclusion: FePS3 is a model system for exploring spin-lattice interactions in 2D antiferromagnets, with pronounced in-plane anisotropy in magnetic and phonon excitations and strong spin-phonon coupling supported by multiple experimental evidence.

Abstract: We report a comprehensive magneto-optical investigation of FePS$_3$ single
crystals using temperature-dependent polarized transmission spectroscopy and
Faraday rotation measurements. Our data reveal pronounced in-plane anisotropy
in both phonon and magnon excitations, emerging distinctly below the N\'eel
temperature ($T_N \approx 118$ K). A prominent magnon mode at 122 cm$^{-1}$
exhibits characteristic redshifting with increasing temperature and
field-induced splitting, confirming its magnetic origin. The optical
conductivity, extracted via Drude-Lorentz modeling, shows
polarization-sensitive spectral changes across the magnetic transition. The
appearance of Raman-active modes in the infrared spectra, along with the
observation of multiple phonons contributing to Faraday rotation, provides
compelling evidence for spin-phonon coupling and inversion symmetry breaking in
the magnetically ordered state. These findings highlight the intricate
interplay between spin and lattice degrees of freedom in FePS$_3$, positioning
it as a model system for exploring spin-lattice interactions in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets.

Abstract: Spin-flip inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy allows magnetic materials
to be probed at the single-atom level via scanning tunneling microscopy.
Previously, the local spectral weight of spin excitations of small systems has
been deduced from discrete steps in the differential conductance. However, this
is not viable for large systems. We show that the local spin density of states
can be measured via the double differential conductance. This contrasts with
elastic measurements where the local density of electronic states is deduced
from the differential conductance. We study the tunneling currents of the
spin-1/2 and -1 Heisenberg chains and propose a method to probe zero-frequency
modes.

Abstract: Superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions
(EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices is
investigated using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)
algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a
Hubbard interaction is also included. The number of phonons associated with the
bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a
phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into
intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass it is
determined that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light
pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC
lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at large phonon frequency
and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping
effects. The transition temperature of Bose--Einstein condensates of these
pairs is estimated. It is determined that intersite bipolarons are associated
with regions of high transition temperatures.

Method: The method involves using a double-tip STM with independent controls for each tip, measuring tunneling currents, and developing a nonequilibrium theory to relate the coincidence dynamical conductance to the current correlation function.

Result: The method successfully captures both normal and superconducting electron propagation processes, providing a direct way to study two-body correlations in various states of matter.

Conclusion: The coincidence double-tip STS technique is a significant advancement, offering a powerful tool for researchers to investigate strongly correlated electron systems in different states, enhancing our understanding of complex electron behaviors in these systems.

Abstract: The development of new experimental techniques for direct measurement of
many-body correlations is crucial for unraveling the mysteries of strongly
correlated electron systems. In this work, we propose a coincidence double-tip
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) that enables direct probing of spatially
resolved dynamical two-body correlations of sample electrons. Unlike
conventional single-tip scanning tunneling microscopy, the double-tip STS
employs a double-tip scanning tunneling microscope (STM) equipped with two
independently controlled tips, each biased at distinct voltages ($V_1$ and
$V_2$). By simultaneously measuring the quantum tunneling currents $I_1(t)$ and
$I_2(t)$ at locations $j_1$ and $j_2$, we obtain a coincidence tunneling
current correlation $\overline{\langle I_1(t) I_2(t)\rangle}$. Differentiating
this coincidence tunneling current correlation with respect to the two bias
voltages yields a coincidence dynamical conductance. Through the development of
a nonequilibrium theory, we demonstrate that this coincidence dynamical
conductance is proportional to a contour-ordered second-order current
correlation function. For the sample electrons in a nearly free Fermi liquid
state, the coincidence dynamical conductance captures two correlated dynamical
electron propagation processes: (i) from $j_1$ to $j_2$ (or vice versa) driven
by $V_1$, and (ii) from $j_2$ to $j_1$ (or vice versa) driven by $V_2$. For the
sample electrons in a superconducting state, additional propagation channels
emerge from the superconducting condensate, coexisting with the above normal
electron propagation processes. Thus, the coincidence double-tip STS provides
direct access to spatially resolved dynamical two-body correlations, offering a
powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated electron systems.

Abstract: The interplay between electronic correlations and topology is a central topic
in the study of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of
the orbital-selective Mott phase (OSMP) on the topological properties of
FeTe1-xSex (FTS), an iron chalcogenide superconductor known to host both
non-trivial Z2 topology and strong electronic correlations. Using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we track the evolution of
topological surface states across various doping levels and temperatures. We
identify a topological phase transition between trivial and non-trivial
topology as a function of selenium content, with critical behavior observed
between x = 0.04 and x = 0.09. Additionally, we find that at elevated
temperatures, the coherence of the topological surface state deteriorates due
to the emergence of OSMP, despite the topological invariant remaining intact.
Our results demonstrate that the non-trivial topology in iron chalcogenide is
fragile under strong electronic correlations.

Result: RG分析显示材料中的U/γ比值降低，趋近于共形极限，与数值研究一致。

Conclusion: 开发的RG方法为研究拓扑平坦带材料的基础，尤其适用于多种类似结构。

Abstract: We develop a perturbative renormalization group (RG) theory for the
topological heavy fermion (THF) model, describing magic-angle twisted bilayer
graphene (MATBG) as an emergent Anderson lattice. The realistic parameters
place MATBG near an intermediate regime where the Hubbard interaction $U$ and
the hybridization energy $\gamma$ are comparable, motivating the need for RG
analysis. Our approach analytically tracks the flow of single-particle
parameters and Coulomb interactions within an energy window below $0.1$ eV,
providing implications for distinguishing between Kondo-like ($U\gg \gamma$)
and projected-limit/Mott-semimetal ($U\ll \gamma$) scenarios at low energies.
We show that the RG flows generically lower the ratio $U/\gamma$ and drive
MATBG toward the chiral limit, consistent with the previous numerical study
based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald model. The framework presented here also
applies to other moir\'e systems and stoichiometric materials that admit a THF
description, including magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, twisted
checkerboard model, and Lieb lattice, among others, providing a foundation for
developing low-energy effective theories relevant to a broad class of
topological flat-band materials.

### [30] [Influence of Three-Body Effects on Halogen Bonding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17619)
*Sharon A. Ochieng,Konrad Patkowski*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A new dataset 3BXB is created by adding a third partner to existing SH250 data, focusing on noncovalent interactions. They computed interaction energies using CCSD(T) and performed energy decompositions using SAPT to understand binding origins. Results show two-body attractions are mainly electrostatic or dispersion, while three-body effects vary based on induction. Two-body SAPT with δMP2 gives accurate interaction energies with acceptable error margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is about understanding noncovalent molecular interactions, which are crucial in chemistry and drug design. They aim to develop accurate benchmark datasets and computational methods to model these interactions better.

Method: They construct a dataset by combining existing SH250 data with a third partner. They compute interaction energies with CCSD(T) and use SAPT-based methods to decompose the energies into one-body, two-body, and three-body components, focusing on both additive and nonadditive effects. They test different approaches for nonadditive dispersion and find that their method with δMP2 correction provides reliable interaction energies.

Result: The analysis shows two-body interactions are mainly electrostatic or dispersion, while three-body nonadditive induction has a varied but significant impact. The best method for nonadditive dispersion is δMP2 plus SAPT(DFT), achieving low errors in interaction energies with moderate computational cost.

Conclusion: A new noncovalent benchmark dataset for complexes with three interacting partners is introduced, aiding in understanding the physical origins of binding. The study successfully combines CCSD(T) calculations with clever energy decomposition via SAPT to model interactions, identifying dominant forces and sources of error, providing direction for future methods and dataset expansions.

Abstract: We construct a new noncovalent benchmark dataset 3BXB that combines
halogen-bonded bimolecular complexes from the SH250 dataset [Kriz and Rezac,
Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2022, 24, 14794] with a third interacting partner,
either H$_2$O or CH$_4$. The reference total and three-body interaction
energies are computed at the CCSD(T) level. To shed light on the physical
origins of binding and cooperativity in complexes of this kind, several
symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)-based energy decompositions were
performed for both pairwise additive and nonadditive terms. We found that the
two-body attractions in the 3BXB complexes are dominated by either
electrostatics or dispersion, while the three-body effect is dominated by
induction and can be either attractive or repulsive. An accurate recovery of
reference interaction energies is attained by the wavefunction-based two-body
SAPT variants including the $\delta$MP2 correction, combined with the SAPT(DFT)
estimates of nonadditive induction and first-order exchange and any estimate of
nonadditive dispersion. The values for the latter term are sometimes quite
inconsistent between different approaches; fortunately, nonadditive dispersion
is a relatively minor effect for complexes studied here, and all reasonable
estimates lead to total interaction energies of similar accuracy.

TL;DR: The study uses spinDMFT to simulate NMR experiments with many spins, focusing on local quantum effects by comparing with classical systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents an efficient method for simulating complex NMR experiments, particularly relevant for systems with many interacting spins, which is a challenging problem.

Method: Dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) is employed to reduce the complexity of the lattice system to a single-site problem, enabling numerical computation with minimal effort while retaining quantum degrees of freedom.

Result: The method successfully incorporates quadrupolar terms and efficiently studies the interplay between dipolar and quadrupolar interactions across various parameter ranges.

Conclusion: SpinDMFT proves effective in capturing local quantum effects, offering a valuable alternative to classical approaches for analyzing complex spin systems in NMR experiments.

Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a
notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The
recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin
systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with
this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent
single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational
effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a
quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the
interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range,
i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We highlight the relevance
of local quantum effects by a comparison with the classical analogue system.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for predicting ionization in HX⁺, which can aid future experimental and theoretical research on ion production mechanisms in various environments.

Abstract: The absolute cross sections for the production of X2+ and X3+ ions following
absorption of monochromatized SOLEIL synchrotron radiation by the HX+ hydride
molecular ions (X = S,Cl) are presented as a function of photon energy in the
region of the X 2p ionisation thresholds (180 eV and 220 eV for sulphur and

of extensive ab initio density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock
configuration interaction calculations including spin-orbit coupling to compute
the absorption oscillator strengths of the X 2p core excitations to valence and
Rydberg states. In order to account for all the experimental features,the
calculations must include vibrational dynamics and spin-orbit coupling. Similar
experimental data are also presented for the sulfanyumil H2S+ molecular ion.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method to engineer sharply peaked, distance-selective
interactions between neutral atoms by exploiting interaction-induced resonances
within a resonantly driven Rydberg ladder system. By tuning laser parameters, a
subsystem eigenstate twist rapidly and brought into degeneracy with the atomic
ground state at precisely defined interatomic separations, resulting in an
effective potential sharply localized around this resonance distance. Unlike
previous off-resonant macrodimer-based schemes, our approach significantly
enhances interaction sharpness and strength, reaching MHz scales, and provides
straightforward experimental tunability without requiring sub-wavelength
positional control. Analytic expressions, validated through comprehensive
master-equation simulations, detail the interaction profile's amplitude, width,
and resonant distance. This precise control facilitates parallel entangling
gates crucial for measurement-based quantum computing and enables simulation of
complex lattice Hamiltonians with customizable connectivity. Additionally, our
scheme opens possibilities for novel studies in molecular physics through
micrometer-scale bond-length diatomic molecules.

Conclusion: 该方案通过单光子过程实现了高效的分子转移到光致引力陷阱，降低了传统冷却所需的复杂性，为相关领域的研究提供了创新方法。

Abstract: We propose a scheme to transfer molecules from a slow beam into an optical
trap using only a single photon absorption and emission cycle. The efficiency
of such a scheme is numerically explored for BaF using realistic experimental
parameters. The technique makes use of the state-dependent potential in an
external electric field to trap molecules from an initial velocity of order
10m/s. A rapid optical transition at the point where the molecules come to a
standstill in the electric field potential irreversibly transfers them into a
~7mK optical dipole trap. For a pulsed Stark decelerated beam, we estimated the
per-shot efficiency to be ~0.04% or up to ~103 molecules, with a potential
factor 20 improvement when the fields are synchronously modulated with the
arriving velocity components. The irreversibility of the scheme allows for
larger numbers to be built up over time. Since this scheme does not rely on a
closed cycling transition for laser cooling, it broadens the range of molecules
that can be used for research on cold molecular chemistry, quantum information,
and fundamental interactions in optical traps.

Motivation: cold atomic collisions and Fano resonance are hot topics in modern physics. understanding their angle dependence can provide insights into atomic interactions.

Method: theoretical study with complex-valued parameter w, angle dependence of q parameter, calculations for cold elastic collisions between hydrogen and krypton atoms.

Result: angle dependence of Fano resonance is strong and sensitive to atomic interaction potentials, new parameter w useful for studying interactions.

Conclusion: this work bridges theory with experiment, promoting deeper understanding of cold atomic collisions and interaction potentials.

Abstract: The scattering angle dependence of Fano resonance profiles in cold atomic
collisions has been theoretically studied. A complex-valued parameter $ w $
with an analytical formula describing the asymmetry of the resonance profile is
proposed as a new development from previous work on electron resonance
scattering from atoms [F. Koike, J. Phys. $\mathbf{B10}$, 2883 (1977)]. It
serves as the general formulation which leads to the angle-dependence of Fano's
$ q $ parameter. Calculations for the case of cold elastic collisions of
hydrogen atoms with krypton atoms have been accomplished. The strong angle
dependence of the resonance profile asymmetry in the differential scattering
cross section due to the interference with non-resonant partial waves is
demonstrated. The scattering angle dependence of the resonance profile and thus
the newly proposed asymmetry parameter is highly sensitive to the inter-atomic
interaction potentials. This is likely to prove useful for the study of
interaction potentials themselves.

Abstract: Since their prediction by Einstein at the dawn of quantum mechanics,
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), owing to their property to show quantum
phenomena on macroscopic scales, are drawing increasing attention across
various fields in physics. They are the subject of many fascinating
observations in various physical systems, from liquid helium to diluted atomic
gases. In addition to real particles like atoms and composite bosons such as
Cooper pairs or excitons, this phenomenon is also observed in gases of
quasiparticles such as polaritons and magnons - quanta of spin-wave excitations
in magnetic media. The fundamental property of the BEC state is its coherence,
which is represented by a precisely defined phase of the corresponding wave
function, which arises spontaneously and encompasses all particles gathered at
the bottom of their spectrum. Until now, the BEC phase was only revealed in
phenomena depending on the spatial phase difference, such as interference,
second order coherence, and macroscopic BEC motions - supercurrents,
superfluidity and Josephson oscillations. Here, we present a method for the
direct time-domain measurement of the magnon BEC coherent state phase relative
to an outside reference signal. We report the emergence of spontaneous
coherence from a freely evolving magnon gas, which manifests as the
condensation of magnons into a uniform precession state with minimal energy and
a well-defined phase. These findings confirm all postulated fundamental
properties of quasiparticle condensates, provide access to a new degree of
freedom in such systems, and open up the possibility of information processing
using microwave-frequency magnon BECs.

Abstract: The Calogero-Sutherland model represents a paradigmatic example of an
integrable quantum system with applications ranging from cold atoms to random
matrix theory. Combining sum rules with the Monte Carlo technique, we introduce
a stochastic method that allows one to compute the dynamic structure factor and
obtain an exact description of excitations beyond the conventional Luttinger
liquid regime. We explore a broad range of interaction regimes, including weak
interactions, where a Bogoliubov-type spectrum emerges, the Tonks-Girardeau
regime, where excitations resemble those of an ideal Fermi gas, and strong
interactions, where umklapp scattering leads to a Brillouin zone structure,
typical of a crystal. Additionally, we discuss the connection between the
hydrodynamic description of one-dimensional quantum gases, liquids, and solids
with the Calogero-Sutherland wave function. The model's universality extends
beyond atoms in waveguides, with implications for disordered systems and random
matrix theory.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: Summary highlights the paper's solution to a challenge in ultracold atomic gas imaging by addressing polarization-induced aberrations, demonstrating successful model and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the issue of polarization-dependent imaging in ultracold atomic gases, a critical challenge in non-destructive spin-resolved imaging. This problem arises when the spins of cold atoms cause different refractive indices for different polarizations, disrupting the required image overlap. The motivation is to overcome this challenge to enable precise imaging despite spin orientation variations.

Method: The study employs a theoretical modeling approach that integrates atomic tensor polarizability with spin orientation under varying magnetic fields. This model predicts phase shifts that cause image distortions. Experimentally, they use an Ioffe-Pritchard trap to trap ultracold atoms and observe distortions. They validate their model by comparing predictions with experimental data across different temperatures, finding a residual offset and suggesting optical asymmetries as the cause. They also explore using off-axis holography and a Fourier-phase mask for aberration correction through numerical processing.

Result: The method successfully models and corrects the polarization-induced phase shifts, as evidenced by quantitative reproduction of observed distortions and the correction method for off-axis holography images.

Conclusion: The paper presents a comprehensive solution to the image distortion problem caused by spin-dependent polarization in ultracold atomic gases, using a combined model and experimental verification. The residual offset suggests further optimization is needed, but the results are significant for advancing non-destructive imaging techniques in ultracold atom studies.

Abstract: Nondestructive spin-resolved imaging of ultracold atomic gases requires
calculating the differences of the refractive indices seen by two circular
probe polarizations. Perfect overlap of the two images, corresponding to two
different polarizations, is required well below the feature size of interest.
In this paper, we demonstrate that the birefringence of atoms in magnetic field
gradients results in polarization-dependent aberrations in the image, which
deteriorates the overlap. To that end, we develop a model that couples atomic
tensor polarizability with position-dependent spin orientation and yields
aberration predictions for accumulated phase shifts in arbitrary field
geometries. Applied to data from an ultra-cold atomic cloud trapped in a
Ioffe-Pritchard trap, the model quantitatively reproduces the observed
distortion across a range of temperatures. A residual offset of
$\sim1\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ remains even under uniform field conditions, likely due
to optical asymmetries. For images obtained through off-axis holography, the
full complex field of the probe enables post-processing removal of all
magnetically induced aberrations through a single numerically calculated
Fourier-space phase mask.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log
Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to
order $1/N$. Analytical regularization of these theories requires consistently
shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done
by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms
to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle
raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly
in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the
long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results
including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation
of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that
the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its
$\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the
vector's scaling dimension.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in holographic QCD with background magnetic fields and baryon density. By setting appropriate boundary conditions, they show that the ground state is the CSL. They interpret the CSL as D4-branes in the holographic setup, associating the chiral soliton with instanton vortices. The baryon numbers are unified using the WZW term, and the pion decay constant shows dependence on the magnetic field. Their results align qualitatively with lattice QCD for strong fields.

Motivation: The paper combines condensed matter physics with high energy physics through holographic QCD, making the study of chiral solitons in magnetic fields and baryon density relevant to both fields. The use of D4-branes and WZW term adds a geometric interpretation, which could offer insights into the dynamics of quantum chromodynamics in extreme conditions.

Method: The authors employ a holographic approach within AdS/CFT correspondence. They use boundary conditions for gauge fields and quark masses to derive the ground state as a chiral soliton lattice. Geometric interpretations using D4-branes and instanton vortices, along with the WZW term in chiral perturbation theory, are key methods. Analytical results for the pion decay constant validate the model against lattice QCD findings in strong magnetic fields.

Result: The study successfully models the CSL in the presence of background magnetic fields and baryon density. By linking chiral solitons to instanton vortices and unifying baryon numbers via the WZW term, they provide a comprehensive framework. The analytical determination of the pion decay constant aligns with lattice QCD results, particularly in strong magnetic fields, enhancing the understanding of QCD dynamics in such conditions.

Conclusion: The paper's findings offer a holographic solution for QCD in magnetic fields, interpreting chiral solitons and baryon numbers geometrically. This work bridges condensed matter and high energy physics, providing a unified framework for studying QCD under extreme conditions with implications for both fields.

Abstract: We investigate the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) in the framework of
holographic QCD in magnetic field. Under appropriate boundary conditions for
the gauge field and the quark mass deformation, we demonstrate that the ground
state in the gravitational dual of QCD is given by the CSL in the background
magnetic field and the baryon number density. In the presence of the background
magnetic field, we show that the CSL is interpreted as a uniformly distributed
D4-branes in the holographic setup, where the chiral soliton is identified with
a non-self-dual instanton vortex or a center vortex in the five dimensional
bulk gauge theory. While the baryon numbers are given to chiral solitons as
well as Skyrmions due to the different terms in the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW)
term in the chiral perturbation theory, these baryon numbers with different
origins are unified in terms of the instanton charge density in five
dimensions. With bulk analysis of the WZW term, we find that the pion decay
constant becomes dependent on the magnetic field. For the massless pion case,
we obtain an analytical form that is in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD
results for strong magnetic fields.

Motivation: 研究的是BPS指数相关的问题，涉及到量子Riemann-Hilbert问题，这在非交换几何和规范场与弦理论中有应用，目的是解决问题的方法。

Method: 将BPS指数生成的问题转化为非交换变形的TBA方程，并通过级数展开得到形式解，最后应用这个方法解决不带refinement情况下的TBA生成函数。

Result: 得出了非交换变形的TBA方程的形式解，并将其用于生成函数的求解。

Conclusion: 研究通过非交换变形提法，解决了量子Riemann-Hilbert问题，并应用于生成TBA方程的解。

Abstract: Refined BPS indices give rise to a quantum Riemann-Hilbert problem that is
inherently related to a non-commutative deformation of moduli spaces arising in
gauge and string theory compactifications. We reformulate this problem in terms
of a non-commutative deformation of a TBA-like equation and obtain its formal
solution as an expansion in refined indices. As an application of this
construction, we derive a generating function of solutions of the TBA equation
in the unrefined case.

### [43] [A conformal approach to matter coupled Aristotelian gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16943)
*Eric A. Bergshoeff,Giacomo Giorgi,Jan Rosseel,Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper proposes a conformal extension of p-brane Aristotelian gravity by combining Minkowski and Euclidean conformal algebras, leading to models without Galilean or Carrollian boost symmetry. They also study various matter couplings in quadratic and higher-derivative models, including those connected to fractons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to advance the understanding of gravity theories with exotic symmetries, specifically exploring how to construct such models using conformal extensions and studying their matter couplings which may have implications in effective field theories or quantum gravity.

Method: The paper extends the p-brane Aristotelian algebra to a direct sum of conformal algebras. They incorporate a single dilatation acting isotropically on longitudinal and transverse directions, leading to models without boost symmetry. They analyze matter couplings in quadratic-derivative and higher-derivative frameworks, including applications to fracton theories.

Result: The proposed conformal extension successfully constructs viable gravity models with unique symmetry properties, demonstrating that such models can exist consistently. Additionally, the inclusion of matter couplings in both quadratic and higher-derivative contexts suggests potential applications in effective field theories or quantum gravity, as the models are shown to be anomaly-free and compatible with desired symmetries. The use of fracton-related theories indicates potential for exploring new phases of gravity or matter with restricted degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: The conformal extension provides a novel framework for constructing gravity theories with neither Galilean nor Carrollian boost symmetry, while the matter couplings suggest fruitful applications in exploring effective field theories and quantum gravity, offering a promising route for further research into exotic gravity models and their connections to condensed matter systems like fractons.

Abstract: We show how to take the first step in the conformal program for constructing
general matter couplings to Aristotelian gravity with arbitrary $p$-brane
foliation. For this purpose we extend the $p$-brane Aristotelian algebra to the
direct sum of two conformal algebras: one with Minkowski signature for the
longitudinal directions and a second one with Euclidean signature for the
transverse directions. For some cases, it is sufficient to work with a
subalgebra of this conformal extension that, instead of two dilatations that
are isotropic in either the longitudinal or transverse directions, contains a
single dilatation that acts on the longitudinal and transverse directions in an
an-isotropic way. Using this conformal extension we show how different electric
and magnetic versions of Aristotelian gravity can be constructed that all have
the distinguishing property that they are not invariant under any (Galilean or
Carrollian) boost symmetry. We next consider several matter couplings both for
quadratic-derivative models as well as for some higher-derivative models that
have recently been considered in connection with studies on fractons.

### [44] [Higher symmetries, anomalies, and crossed squares in lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16966)
*Anton Kapustin,Lev Spodyneiko*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies in quantum lattice gauge theories, showing they emerge from symmetry transformations restricted to spatial regions, packaged into higher groups, particularly 3-groups in 2D and n-cubes using nonabelian Cech methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's exploration of higher-form symmetries in quantum field theories is timely given recent advances in understanding 't Hooft anomalies and their role in constraining renormalization group flows. This work provides a novel framework using operator algebras and homotopy theory to unify these concepts.

Method: The authors employ both operator-algebraic techniques and homotopy theory, organizing symmetry restrictions into higher groups. They use a nonabelian Cech construction to generalize these structures to higher dimensions, providing a systematic approach to higher-form symmetries.

Result: The key result is framing higher-group structures in lattice models and QFTs, demonstrating that higher-group data arises from the localization of ('t Hooft) anomalies. This connects symmetry structures to topological terms in path integrals and implications for quantum gravity.

Conclusion: This framework offers a unified perspective on higher-form symmetries, 't Hooft anomalies, and their impact on low-energy effective theories, field space topology, and quantum gravitational implications, providing a road map for future research in these areas.

Abstract: We examine higher-form symmetries of quantum lattice gauge theories through
the lens of homotopy theory and operator algebras. We show that in the
operator-algebraic approach both higher-form symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies
arise from considering restrictions of symmetry transformations to spatial
regions. The data of these restrictions are naturally packaged into a higher
group. For example, for gauge theories in two spatial dimensions, this
information is encoded in a crossed square of groups, which is an algebraic
model of a 3-group. In general, we propose that higher groups appear in lattice
models and QFT as crossed n-cubes of groups via a nonabelian version of the
Cech construction.

Abstract: We study the additivity and Haag duality of the von Neumann algebra of a
quantum field theory $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ with 0-form (and the dual
$(d-2)$-form) (non)-invertible global symmetry $\mathcal{F}$. We analyze the
symmetric (uncharged) sector von Neumann algebra of $\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$
with the inclusion of bi-local and bi-twist operators in it. We establish the
connection between the existence of these non-local operators in
$\mathcal{T}_\mathcal{F}$ and certain properties of the Lagrangian algebra
$\mathcal{L}$ of the extended operators in the corresponding symmetry
topological field theory (SymTFT). We prove that additivity or Haag duality of
the symmetric sector von Neumann algebra is violated when $\mathcal{L}$
satisfies specific criteria, thus generalizing the result of Shao, Sorce and
Srivastava to arbitrary dimensions. We further demonstrate the SymTFT
construction via concrete examples in two dimensions.

Abstract: $1+1$-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to an adjoint Majorana
fermion, also known as adjoint QCD$_2$, has the surprising feature that at
fermion mass $\sqrt{\frac{g^2 N}{2 \pi}}$ it exhibits supersymmetry. In this
paper, we obtain a deeper insight into how the supersymmetry works by
constructing the gauge invariant, Lorentz covariant supercurrent $j_{\mu A}$.
Its conservation relies crucially on the presence of a quantum anomaly. We
generalize this construction to a class of models where, in addition to an
adjoint Majorana fermion of an appropriate mass, the gauge theory is coupled to
some collection of massless fermions ($SU(N)$ may be replaced by a more general
gauge group). In general, these models have a supersymmetric massive sector and
a non-supersymmetric CFT sector [arXiv:2202.04017], but there are cases in
which both sectors are supersymmetric. An example of such a gapless, fully
supersymmetric model is $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to three adjoint Majorana
fermions, of which two are massless and the third has mass $\sqrt{\frac{3g^2
N}{2\pi}}$.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We analyze the physical consequences of scattering Hawking radiation emitted
in the vicinity of the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking
radiation from the horizon becomes soft at a large distance away from the
horizon due to the gravitational redshift, and the above process is exactly the
soft theorem in curved spacetime. For an observer located at infinity, such a
scattering process introduces a large gauge transformation, which can be
regarded as a memory effect. The large gauge transformation is expected to
encode more information about the radiation and might shed light on the black
hole information paradox.

Abstract: We provide a concrete link between celestial amplitudes and cosmological
correlators. We first construct a map from quantum field theories (QFTs) in
$(D+2)$-dimensional Euclidean space to theories on the $(D+1)$-dimensional
sphere, through a Weyl rescaling and a Fourier transformation. An analytic
continuation extends this map to a relation between QFTs in Minkowski spacetime
$\text{M}_{D+2}$ and in de Sitter spacetime $\text{dS}_{D+1}$ with the
Bunch-Davies vacuum. Combining this relation with celestial holography, we show
that the extrapolated operators in de Sitter space can be represented by
operators on the celestial sphere $S^{D}$. Our framework offers a systematic
route to transfer computational techniques and physical insights between
celestial holography and the dS/CFT correspondence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解不同截断方案对理论结果的影响，选择最稳健的方案。

Method: 使用三阶标量场论的双重循环计算，比较不同截断方法，并量化它们之间的差异。

Result: 死节截断比其他方案更稳定，减少对非微扰效应的依赖，提供了更可靠的理论描述。

Conclusion: 死节截断方法优于光滑截断，用于研究无质量标量场的多普勒效应。

Abstract: In effective field theories, the concept of renormalization of perturbative
divergences is replaced by renormalization group concepts such as relevance and
universality. Universality is related to cutoff scheme independence in
renormalization. Three-dimensional scalar field theory with just the quartic
coupling is universal but the less relevant sextic coupling introduces a cutoff
scheme dependence, which we quantify by three independent parameters, in the
two-loop order of perturbation theory. However, reasonable schemes only allow
reduced ranges of those parameters, even contrasting the sharp cutoff with very
smooth cutoffs. The sharp cutoff performs better. In any case, the effective
field theory possesses some degree of universality even in the massive case
(off criticality).

### [50] [Nilpotency Property, Physicality Criteria, Constraints and Standard BRST Algebra: A 4D Field-Theoretic System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17590)

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper uses the BRST formalism to analyze symmetries in a combined gauge theory system, deriving nilpotent charges and exploring their implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding symmetries and BRST charges in multi-field gauge theories is key for quantizing such systems correctly.

Method: Uses BRST formalism, derives nilpotent charges, and explores CF-type restrictions in the combined system.

Result: Obtained nilpotent currents, defined CF constraints, derived BRST algebra, concluded physical states from constraints.

Conclusion: Successful analysis and conclusions provide a robust foundation for the quantization framework of these gauge theories.

Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we
discuss the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and the bosonic ghost-scale
symmetries of a set of coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for the
four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) combined field-theoretic system of the free
Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories. We demonstrate that the Noether
(anti-)BRST charges are non-nilpotent due to the presence of a set of
non-trivial Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions on our theory. These CF-type
restrictions are derived and discussed from different theoretical angles in our
present endeavor. In addition to it, we obtain the nilpotent versions of the
above (anti-)BRST charges from their counterparts non-nilpotent versions and
discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the nilpotent charges to show that the
physical states (existing in the total quantum Hilbert space of states) are
those that are annihilated by the operator forms of the first-class constraints
of our classical 4D combined field-theoretic system. The standard BRST algebra
among the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and the bosonic ghost charge is
derived, too.

TL;DR: The paper examines Minimal Massive Gravity by adding an auxiliary field, revealing novel symmetries and extending symplectic methods, but the resulting charges are complex and incomplete.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores an alternative to Einstein gravity, aiming to make Higher-Derivative Gravity (HDG) consistent by introducing an auxiliary field, possibly to render the theory renormalizable and avoid ghosts.

Method: Uses covariant phase space methods and studies gauge symmetries involving a new transformation, replacing the Kosmann derivative to construct charges even when the algebra isn't closed for all fields.

Result: 发现了三个相互作用的规范对称性，提出了一个新的生成对称准确性和构建chargemethod，尽管这种变换在基本场上的对称性不闭合，但通过参数极限，看起来这个对应于近似的平移对称，导出了一个有用的规范不变电荷，复杂地将移动生成和积分规范电荷结合起来。

Conclusion: 在参数极限下，即使规范代数没有闭合，这种方法仍然能导引出规范不变的电荷，为扩展规范代数的方法提供了一种可能，需要进一步验证其在更广泛上的适用性。此外，使用辅助场的方法为Einstein引力的替代方案提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a three-dimensional gravitational model known
as Minimal Massive Gravity (MMG), which includes an auxiliary field, using the
covariant phase space method. Our analysis reveals the presence of three gauge
symmetries whose algebras close via field recombination and parameter
classification within this framework. Upon incorporating these additional
symmetries within a specific limit of parameters, we find that the Kosmann
derivative should be replaced by a novel transformation compatible with Wald's
approach, which establishes a new mechanism for generating exact symmetries and
constructing their corresponding conserved charge in theories with auxiliary
fields, extending beyond standard methods. However, this transformation does
not yield closed algebras on the space of fundamental fields. We find that this
corresponds to a Lorentz vector that characterizes the approximate completeness
of translation symmetry. As a result, we obtain a gauge invariant charge at a
certain limit of parameters, which emerges as a nontrivial combination of the
diffeomorphism charge and integrable gauge charges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be pushing the boundaries in cosmological field theories by introducing pseudo-Hermitian components, which could lead to unconventional yet potentially significant physical insights.}

Method: The authors analyze a complex scalar field setup with pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, focusing on the dynamics when antilinear symmetry is broken, examining how complex eigenvalues influence cosmological expansion and equilibrium state formation. They employ analytical methods along with asymptotic analysis to identify the growth and damping mechanisms.>

Result: The paper demonstrates that by tuning the potential minimum, a self-sustaining late-time accelerated expansion can emerge. The system's behavior is characterized by an asymptotic rotation reminiscent of Escher's 'Ascending and Descending,' with the model generating a constant Hubble rate.>

Conclusion: The findings suggest that pseudo-Hermitian field theories might open new avenues for cosmological models, particularly in scenarios involving antilinear symmetry-breaking. This could be a promising direction for both theoretical exploration and observational testing in cosmology.}< the end ret of the response is too long, so I need to make it more concise. Let me try to summarize the key points in a shorter way. The paper introduces a new mechanism in pseudo-Hermitian field theory for accelerated expansion. It involves broken antilinear symmetry, where unstable dynamics balance Hubble damping. The fields settle into a rolling motion, leading to a self-sustained Hubble rate, even without a standard vacuum energy. This could offer new insights into cosmological models.>} {

Abstract: We show that a well-studied pseudo-Hermitian field theory composed of two
complex scalar fields can generate accelerated cosmological expansion through a
novel mechanism. The dynamics is unique to the pseudo-Hermitian field theory,
and it arises in the regime of broken antilinear symmetry, wherein a growth
instability from the resulting complex eigenspectrum competes with the Hubble
damping. The azimuthal components of the complex scalar fields asymptote to a
constant rate of rolling at late times, reminiscent of motion around the
infinite staircase of M.C. Escher's lithograph "Ascending and Descending". The
resulting centripetal acceleration drives the radial components of the field
away from the minimum of the potential, and the system generates a
self-sustaining and constant Hubble rate at late times, even when tuning the
minimum of the potential such that the classical vacuum energy is vanishing.
This result evidences the potential to generate novel and physically relevant
dynamics that are unique to pseudo-Hermitian field theories, and that their
regimes of broken antilinear symmetry can be physically relevant in dynamical
spacetimes.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of eccentric binary pulsars embedded in dark
matter environments. While previous studies have primarily focused on circular
orbits in collisionless dark matter halos, we extend this framework to
eccentric systems and explore their interaction with ultralight scalar fields.
Adopting a perturbative approach, we compute the modifications to the orbital
period induced by dark matter-driven dynamical friction. Our results show that
orbital eccentricity amplifies the imprints of non-vacuum environments on
binary dynamics, underscoring the potential of such systems as sensitive probes
for dark matter signatures.

Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial
superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from
black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the
superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been
derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note
we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black
hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective
implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing
minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum
of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced
by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem lies in exploring solution generating techniques in Einstein-Maxwell theory, particularly within pure magnetic or electric sectors, to expand the family of exact solutions available in these models. This is relevant to understanding gravitational physics and phenomena such as black holes.

Method: They develop generalized Harrison transformations within the Ernst formalism for EMM and EMPM models. These transformations preserve the magnetic or electric sector, enabling the derivation of new solutions by applying them to known metrics. The authors derive black diholes in EMM and extended to EMDM models.

Result: New exact solutions, including black diholes, are presented, which are configurations of extremal black holes balanced in equilibrium within these theories. These solutions expand the known solution space for non-linear electrodynamics coupled to gravity.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of gravitational theories with non-linear electrodynamics, providing new insights into multi-component black hole solutions that can model various astrophysical scenarios.

Abstract: Einstein-Maxwell theory has powerful solution generating techniques which
include Harrison transformations in the Ernst formalism. We construct
generalized Harrison transformations that preserve the purely magnetic or
purely electric sector in Einstein-ModMax (EMM) theory. Thus, they serve as
solution generating techniques within these sectors for this model of
non-linear electrodynamics minimally coupled to gravity. As an application we
rederive several known exact solutions of EMM and a new solution, black
diholes, describing two extremal BHs in equilibrium, with opposite magnetic
charges, whose attraction is balanced by their embedding in the Melvin magnetic
universe of this model. As a further generalization, we consider
Einstein-dilaton-ModMax theory, and provide the extremal charged BHs and black
diholes also in this model.

Motivation: The paper addresses fundamental questions in quantum gravity, specifically the black hole information paradox. Researchers are motivated to find a model that resolves the paradox by demonstrating unitarity despite Hawking radiation.

Method: The authors formulate a toy quantum model using quantum-controlled unitaries to simulate Hawking radiation. This involves evolving the black hole into a superposition of states, modeling particle production coherently, and ensuring unitarity through mathematical proof.

Result: The model shows that the black hole can fully evaporate while remaining unitary. However, the information paradox might still hold as information's fate in the evaporation process is uncertain.

Conclusion: This work provides a quantum approach to black hole evaporation and unitarity, though the information paradox remains unresolved in the final analysis.

Abstract: Black hole evaporation is one of the most striking phenomena at the interface
between gravity and quantum physics. In Hawking's semi-classical treatment,
where matter is quantum mechanical and the spacetime is definite and classical,
evaporation leads to an apparent loss of unitarity of the overall evolution,
and to the so-called black hole information paradox. Here, we go beyond this
semi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole
evaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being
fully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking
particles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We
model Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled
unitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a
quantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the
probability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time
until the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of
the quantum superposition. We prove that under natural assumptions, this
evaporation model is unitary, such that the initial state can in principle be
recovered from the final asymptotic state of the radiation.

### [57] [On the stability of exceptional Brans-Dicke wormholes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17045)
*Kirill A. Bronnikov,Sergei V. Bolokhov,Milena V. Skvortsova,Rustam Ibadov,Feruza Y. Shaymanova*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the stability of wormholes in Brans-Dicke theory with ω=0, finding stability when the charge q is non-zero and instability when q=0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to extend previous studies on the stability of space-times in scalar-tensor theories, specifically focusing on Brans-Dicke theory with ω=0, which includes wormhole solutions. The study aims to understand the behavior of these exceptional solutions under perturbations.

Method: The researchers used perturbation analysis on the metric in both Jordan and Einstein frames to assess the stability of the wormholes. They considered radial monopole perturbations and examined how the charge affects the potential solutions and their regularity.

Result: The results show that wormholes are stable when they possess a non-zero charge, indicating that the charges may play a crucial role in maintaining stability. Conversely, when the charge is zero, the wormhole solutions are unstable, suggesting that zero charge may lead to gravitational collapse or instability in these space-times.

Conclusion: This study contributes to the understanding of the stability properties of wormhole solutions in Brans-Dicke theory, particularly when ω=0. It highlights the importance of charge in determining the stability of these space-times and provides insights into how scalar-tensor theories predict the behavior of exotic gravitational configurations under perturbations.

Abstract: In our previous papers we have analyzed the stability of vacuum and
electrovacuum static, spherically symmetric space-times in the framework of the
Bergmann-Wagoner-Nordtvedt class of scalar-tensor theories (STT) of gravity. In
the present paper, we continue this study by examining the stability of
exceptional solutions of the Brans-Dicke theory with the coupling constant
$\omega =0$ that were not covered in the previous studies. Such solutions
describe neutral or charged wormholes and involve a conformal continuation: the
standard conformal transformation maps the whole Einstein-frame manifold
${\mathbb M}_E$ to only a part of the Jordan-frame manifold ${\mathbb M}_J$,
which has to be continued beyond the emerging regular boundary S, and the new
region maps to another manifold ${\mathbb M}_{E-}$. The metric in ${\mathbb
M}_J$ is symmetric with respect to S only if the charge $q$ is zero. Our
stability study concerns radial (monopole) perturbations, and it is shown that
the wormhole is stable if $q \ne 0$ and unstable only in the symmetric case
$q=0$

Abstract: We study two scalarizations of magnetically charged black holes in the
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the nonlinear electrodynamics (NED)
term. For this purpose, two scalar coupling functions $f_1(\phi)$ and
$f_2(\phi)$ are introduced to couple to Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and NED terms. The
bald black hole is described by mass ($M$) and action parameter ($\alpha$) with
magnetic charge ($P$), which becomes the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole
for $P=M$ whose action is still unknown. We derive Smarr formula which
describes a correct thermodynamics for the charged black hole. Two Davies
points of heat capacity are not identified with two critical onset mass and
action parameter for GB$^-$ scalarization with $f_1(\phi)$. Furthermore, the
shadow radius analysis of charged black hole is performed to include naked
singularities and it is compared to the EHT observation. There is no
constraints on the action parameter, whereas new mass constraints are found.
Finally, the NED$^+$ spontaneous scalarization with $f_2(\phi)$ leads to
infinite branches of scalarized charged black holes.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个能够统一解释哈勃张力和暗能量的演化过程的理论框架，通过引入新的自生成动能机制，为当前宇宙学提供了新的视角和可能的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar
fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom
independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that
define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the
Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of
the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation,
another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain
point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late
dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the
observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination
while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are
consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement
of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this
context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our
scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction
of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.

Abstract: We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential
deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General
Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming
deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT)
formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar
fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of
the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian
corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By
establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories
beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects
from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into
essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular,
facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.

Abstract: This paper investigates the observable properties of a Kerr-Sen black hole
surrounded by a thin accretion disk, focusing on the impact of the black hole's
spin and charge on the image. Using ray-tracing techniques, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the black hole's image, redshift distribution, and
intensity distributions at different observation frequencies. The results
demonstrate that spin has a more significant effect on the distortion of the
inner shadow than charge, and the observer's inclination angle plays a critical
role in shaping the redshift distribution, especially near the innermost stable
circular orbit. Additionally, the intensity is found to be higher at 86 GHz
than at 230 GHz. This study highlights the crucial role of the accretion disk's
geometry in determining the black hole's image and redshift effects, thereby
providing a refined theoretical framework to guide future observational efforts
targeting the Kerr-Sen black hole and its electromagnetic signals.

Abstract: We investigate the light deflection and the shadow characteristics of a
non-minimally coupled Horndeski black hole surrounded by a magnetized, cold,
pressureless plasma medium, while considering both homogeneous and
non-homogeneous plasma distributions. We consider an analytical expression for
the deflection angle of light and analyze how it is influenced by the plasma
properties and the Horndeski coupling constant. The circular light orbits,
which define the photon sphere, are also analyzed for both types of plasma
media, highlighting their impact on the shadow boundary. The shadow properties
of the black hole are examined in detail, and constraints on the model
parameters are derived by comparing the theoretical shadow radius with
observational measurements of Sgr A* and M87* obtained by the Event Horizon
Telescope Collaboration. We also study the black hole shadow images along with
the corresponding intensity profiles produced by a radially infalling accretion
flow in the plasma environment. The results are particularly interesting, as
they reveal how the modified black hole geometry affects both the plasma
distribution and the black hole parameters in a realistic astrophysical
context.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the framework of the beyond Horndeski action, we consider three
sub-theories, that support scalarised black-hole solutions, and look for
modified characteristics compared to GR. We first study the propagation of
massless scalar and vector test fields in the fixed background of an analytical
spherically-symmetric black hole derived in the context of a parity-symmetric
beyond Horndeski theory, and show that the profiles of the effective
gravitational potentials, greybody factors, absorption cross-sections and
quasinormal frequencies exhibit distinct modifications as we move away from the
GR limit. We then turn our attention to the perturbations of the gravitational
field itself and adopt a full-theory analysis that takes into account the
backreaction of the scalar field on the metric. Employing as background
solutions scalarised black holes arising in the shift-symmetric Horndeski
theory and in the Quadratic-Quartic-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, we compute the
greybody factors and QNMs of the axial sector. In both theories, in direct
correspondence to the form of the gravitational potential which features
multiple extremal points, we find modified (suppressed or non-monotonic)
greybody curves and altered quasinormal frequencies (smaller oscillating
frequencies and larger damping times), especially as the hair-sourcing
parameter increases.

### [64] [Some features of the extended phase space approach to quantization of gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17371)
*T. P. Shestakova*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the extended phase space approach to quantizing gravity, distinguishing it from other methods while addressing contradictions in assumptions about spacetime topology and asy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantization of gravity is crucial for theoretical physics. This paper aims to clarify the extended phase space approach and its implications on spacetime topology and quantum theory.

Method: The abstract presents the approach, compares assumptions, and evaluates contradictions in methods like Wheeler-DeWitt equation and path integral quantization.

Result: The approach suggests limitations when assuming asymptotic states, potentially leading to issues with unitary evolution. The evaluation questions the validity and implications of this approach.

Conclusion: The extended phase space approach may offer a way to handle non-trivial spacetime topologies but faces challenges ensuring unitary evolution, challenging conventional methods in quantum gravity.

Abstract: In this paper, I emphasize those features of the extended phase space
approach to quantization of gravity that distinguish it among other approaches.
First of all, it is the conjecture about non-trivial topology of the Universe
which was supported by Wheeler, Hawking and other founders of quantum gravity.
However, this conjecture appears to be in contradiction with the assumption
about asymptotic states that is used in the path integral quantization of gauge
theories. The presence of asymptotic states ensures gauge invariance of the
theory, but, in the case of gravity, the states exist only in asymptotically
flat spacetimes, that limits possible topologies. Then we have two ways. The
first way is to consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. In fact, it
reduces quantum gravity to quantum field theory on a given background. The
second way is to reject the assumption about asymptotic states. In the case of
non-trivial topology, one cannot cover the whole spacetime with the only
coordinate system. One has to introduce various reference frames fixed by
different gauge conditions in different spacetime regions. The Hamiltonian
describing a gravitating system will depend on gauge conditions. It leads to
the conclusion that unitary evolution may be broken down. This conclusion
cannot be obtained in approaches based on the Wheeler - DeWitt equation or
making use of the assumption about asymptotic states. The assessment of this
conclusion is given.

### [65] [Mass-Gap Neutron Stars from Vector \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{f(R)} Gravity Inflationary Deformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17384)
*V. K. Oikonomou*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses the existence of mass-gap astrophysical objects and investigates vector f(R) gravity inflationary models to understand neutron star phenomena. Using a double shooting LSODA code with various polytropic equations of state, the study finds that MPA1 fits best, with a maximum mass well within the mass-gap region. Non-viable inflationary models still produce viable neutron star phenomena, suggesting model-dependency. The study underscores the connection between early universe physics and neutron star properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the relationship between inflationary models with vector f(R) gravity and the properties of neutron stars, particularly focusing on the mass-gap region. This is an important area of astrophysics as it addresses the nature of exotic astrophysical objects and the potential existence of small black holes. Understanding the interplay between these two areas could provide insights into high-energy astrophysics and gravitational physics.

Method: The authors employ a numerical method using a double shooting LSODA Python code to solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations under various equations of state. They evaluate cosmological viability, model non-viability, and analyze neutron star constraints to determine the best-fitting equation of state and model. They test multiple polytropic equations of state and assess how well they fit the observed constraints.

Result: The study finds that the MPA1 equation of state provides the best fit to the neutron star constraints, with the maximum mass falling within the mass-gap region. They also note that non-viable inflationary models can still yield viable neutron star phenomena, indicating that the phenomenon is not solely dependent on inflationary models but may have multiple contributing factors.

Conclusion: The research contributes to understanding the interconnection between inflationary models in vector f(R) gravity and the physical properties of neutron stars. It suggests that certain equations of state, particularly MPA1, are favorable for explaining the observed mass distribution in the mass-gap region. Additionally, the findings imply that neutron star phenomena can exist independently of the viability of inflationary models, highlighting the complexity of these astrophysical systems and the need for further interdisciplinary research to reconcile these observations with current theoretical models.

Abstract: The latest observations from the LIGO-Virgo indicated the existence of
mass-gap region astrophysical objects. This is a rather sensational observation
and there are two possibilities for the nature of these mass-gap region
astrophysical objects, these are either small black holes that result from the
mergers of ordinary mass neutron stars, or these are heavy neutron stars. In
the line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall
examine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity
inflationary models. These theories are basically scalar-tensor deformations of
the Starobinsky inflationary model. We shall present the essential features of
cosmologically viable and non-viable deformations of the Starobinsky model,
originating from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary theories, and we indicate
which models and for which equations of state provide a viable neutron star
phenomenology. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations using a robust
double shooting LSODA python based code, for the following piecewise polytropic
equations of state the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the
ENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We confront the resulting phenomenology with
several well known neutron star constraints and we indicate which equation of
state and model fits the phenomenological constraints. A remarkable feature,
also known from other inflationary attractor models, is that the MPA1 is the
equation of state which is most nicely fitted the constraints, for all the
theoretical models used, and actually the maximum mass for this equation of
state is well inside the mass-gap region. Another mentionable feature that
stroked us with surprise is the fact that even cosmologically non-viable
inflationary models produced a viable neutron star phenomenology, which most
likely has to be a model-dependent feature.

Conclusion: 非对流性在规范理论框架下的引力理论中可以成为描述黑洞性质的重要工具，为未来观测探索非对流性效应提供了理论背景。

Abstract: This work presents a new black hole solution within the framework of a
non-commutative gauge theory applied to Kalb-Ramond gravity. Using the method
recently proposed in the literature [Nucl.Phys.B 1017 (2025) 116950], we employ
the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$ to implement
non-commutativity, being encoded by parameter $\Theta$. We begin by verifying
that the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the
event horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The
Kretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns
out that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and
related quantities are not expanded to second order in $\Theta$. We derive the
thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature
$T^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, and heat capacity
$C_V^{(\Theta,\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$ is estimated by
imposing $T^{(\Theta,\ell)} \to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant
indicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is
analyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using
the residue theorem. Notably, in the low-frequency regime, the particle number
density for bosons surpasses that of fermions (at least within the scope of the
methods considered here). The effective potential for a massless scalar field
is obtained perturbatively, enabling the computation of quasinormal modes and
the time-domain profiles. Finally, further bounds on $\Theta$ and $\ell$
(Lorentz-violating paramter) are derived from solar system tests, including the
perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay.

*Luigi Foschini,Alberto Vecchiato,Alfio Bonanno*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper suggests that asymptotically safe gravity could lead to different black hole characteristics, but experiments failed to find deviations from Kerr metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the nature of black holes beyond General Relativity is crucial for reconciling quantum effects and gravitational theories. The study aims to test predictions about modified event horizons and their effects on related phenomena.

Method: The research involved a literature review, data selection from high/soft state observations of stellar-mass black holes, statistical analysis, and comparison with the Kerr metric predictions.

Result: No significant deviations were found between the observed inner radii of the accretion disks and the Kerr metric expectations.

Conclusion: The evidence does not support significant changes to black hole characteristics as predicted by asymptotically safe gravity models. Further research is needed to explore alternative explanations for the discrepancies found in specific cases.

Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have
characteristics different from those described according to general relativity
if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies.
Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which
in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and
the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter
hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the
inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected
the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them
homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of
mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the
expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some
doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object
during the observation or instrumental biases.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the bispectrum of gravitational waves from the poltergeist mechanism when there's a sudden transition between matter and radiation-dominated eras. They find the bispectrum peaks in equilateral or squeezed configurations, allowing it to differentiate from other mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the statistical properties of gravitational waves, like the bispectrum, could provide insights into early universe physics and the mechanisms that generate them. This paper looks at a specific mechanism, the poltergeist, under certain approximations.

Method: The authors calculate the bispectrum under the sudden transition approximation, which models a quick change in the early universe from matter to radiation dominance.

Result: The analysis shows the bispectrum peaks in either equilateral or squeezed configurations, distinguishing the poltergeist mechanism from other GW sources.

Conclusion: The results suggest that the poltergeist mechanism can be identified by its specific bispectrum characteristics, offering a new observational signature for gravitational waves.

Abstract: In the poltergeist mechanism the enhancement of induced gravitational waves
(GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to
the radiation-dominated era. In this work, we calculate the bispectrum of
induced GWs from the poltergeist mechanism by adopting the sudden transition
approximation. We find that the tensor bispectrum peaks either in the
equilateral or squeezed configurations, depending on scales. Such a
characteristic behavior enables us to distinguish it from that from other GW
generation mechanisms.

### [69] [The Nonlinear Tails in Black Hole Ringdown: the Scattering Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17732)
*A. Ianniccari,L. Lo Bianco,A. Riotto*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Black holes emitting gravitational waves lose energy and follow a specific decay pattern based on multipole order, the rate of which is described by a power law of t^{-2l-1}.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to address a fundamental aspect of black hole dynamics by exploring the behavior of gravitational wave emission with fixed multipole moments. The observation of nonlinear decay in ringdown waves is of great interest for theoretical physics, particularly in understanding the dynamics and stability of black holes, which also has implications for gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: The authors use the in-in formalism to perform scattering calculations to derive the decay power law without making nonlinear approximations. They conclude that nonperturbative effects lead to a decay law proportional to t^{-2l -1}, where l is the multipole number.

Result: The analytical calculation confirms that the amplitude of gravitational wave ringdown follows a t^{-2l-1} decay, supporting the idea that nonlinear scattering events significantly impact the decay rate.

Conclusion: The nonperturbative decay of gravitational waves from stationary black holes, as described, provides a concrete theoretical framework for understanding their late-stage inspiral and stability, which can inform future observations in gravitational wave astronomy and computations of binary black hole mergers.

Abstract: Black holes regain their static configuration by emitting ringdown
gravitational waves, whose amplitude decays in time following a power law at
fixed spatial positions. We show that the nonlinear decay power law may be
obtained by simple scattering calculations using the in-in formalism and argue
that the nonperturbative law should be $t^{-2\ell-1}$, where $\ell$ is the
multipole of the propagating spherical gravitational wave.

*Mohammad Azhdari,Ghader Rezazadeh,Raghav Pathak,Hans-Michael Tautenhahn,Franziska Tautenhahn,Tim Ricken,Seyed Morteza Seyedpour*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This study investigates heat transfer in biological tissues using the TPL model and FDM, revealing lower phase lag values than previous literature, emphasizing the need for precise measurements and isolation of parameters to improve bioheat transfer models and clinical thermal therapies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of conventional bioheat transfer models, aiming for more accurate models through parametric investigation of a novel TPL model.

Method: The TPL model was implemented with FDM, experimental data from a 450 nm laser and infrared sensors were collected, and four critical parameters were systematically studied to extract phase lag values.

Result: The study found that the extracted phase lag values were lower than previous studies, indicating the importance of precision and isolation in parameter analysis for refining bioheat transfer models and enhancing clinical thermal therapies.

Conclusion: The research highlights the necessity of high-precision measurements and systematic analysis of each parameter to improve the accuracy of bioheat transfer models, which directly benefits the advancement of thermal therapeutic techniques and clinical applications.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of heat transfer mechanisms in biological
tissues is essential for the advancement of thermal therapeutic techniques and
the development of accurate bioheat transfer models. Conventional models often
fail to capture the inherently complex thermal behavior of biological media,
necessitating more sophisticated approaches for experimental validation and
parameter extraction. In this study, the Two-Dimensional Three-Phase Lag (TPL)
heat transfer model, implemented via the finite difference method (FDM), was
employed to extract key phase lag parameters characterizing heat conduction in
bovine skin tissue. Experimental measurements were obtained using a 450 nm
laser source and two non-contact infrared sensors. The influence of four
critical parameters was systematically investigated: heat flux phase lag
($\tau_{q}$), temperature gradient phase lag ($\tau_{\theta}$), thermal
displacement coefficient ($k^*$), and thermal displacement phase lag
($\tau_{v}$). A carefully designed experimental protocol was used to assess
each parameter independently. The results revealed that the extracted phase lag
values were substantially lower than those previously reported in the
literature. This highlights the importance of high-precision measurements and
the need to isolate each parameter during analysis. These findings contribute
to the refinement of bioheat transfer models and hold potential for improving
the efficacy and safety of clinical thermal therapies.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为ADAPT-VQE的量子算法，旨在利用近端量子计算时代的优势。与传统VQE方法相比，该算法显著降低了电路-depth和缓解了经典优化难题。然而，该算法面临高量子测量（射）overhead的问题，难以实现参数优化和操作符选择。因此，研究提出两种综合策略以减少射overhead，在每一步均可以显著降低射数，同时保持准确性。方法一是复用VQE优化过程中获得的外尔矩阵测量结果，用于下一ADAPT-VQE迭代的操作符选择步骤中的梯度测量。方法二是应用基于方差的射数分配策略，分别用于哈密顿量和梯度测量。数值结果表明，单独采用或结合应用两方法均能显著降低射数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在量子计算时代，尤其是近端量子（NISQ）环境，高效地优化量子电路和提高测量效率是关键。ADAPT-VQE方法通过减少电路-depth和缓解经典优化难题展现出潜力，但其高测量overhead限制了应用。因此，研究旨在通过策略性地减少测量次数，降低overhead，同时保持结果准确性，为量子化学计算提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 该研究提出了一种结合复用测量结果和方差分配的方法。具体地说，方法一是通过复用VQE优化阶段获得的外尔矩阵测量结果来减少梯度测量阶段的射数；方法二则是根据各个测量的方差来动态分配射数，集中资源在方差较大的测量项上。

Result: 研究结果表明，单独使用任一方法或两者结合均可显著降低射数，从而在保持结果准确性的同时大幅减少射次数。实验表明，该方法在化学基底精度下，射次数得以大幅减少，进一步提升了整体计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究在ADAPT-VQE的优化中引入了有效的测量效率提升策略。通过复用和方差分配，显著减少了量子测量所需的射数，从而在不降低计算精度的情况下大幅提升了该量子算法的实用性。为NISQ时代下的量子计算提供了新的思路和优化方法。

Abstract: The Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising
approach for quantum algorithms in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
era, offering advantages over traditional VQE methods by reducing circuit depth
and mitigating challenges in classical optimization. However, a major challenge
in ADAPT-VQE is the high quantum measurement (shot) overhead required for
circuit parameter optimization and operator selection. In this work, we propose
two integrated strategies to reduce the shot requirements in ADAPT-VQE. First,
we reuse Pauli measurement outcomes obtained during VQE parameter optimization
in the subsequent operator selection step of the next ADAPT-VQE iteration,
which involves operator gradient measurements. Second, we apply variance-based
shot allocation to both Hamiltonian and operator gradient measurements. Our
numerical results demonstrate that each method, individually and in
combination, significantly reduces the number of shots needed to achieve
chemical accuracy while maintaining result fidelity across the studied
molecular systems.

### [72] [A resource theoretical unification of Mpemba effects: classical and quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16976)
*Alessandro Summer,Mattia Moroder,Laetitia P. Bettmann,Xhek Turkeshi,Iman Marvian,John Goold*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the Mpemba effect using resource theories. It shows how the thermal Mpemba effect arises from athermality and symmetry-restoring Mpemba effect from asymmetry. The dynamics of thermalization are split into symmetry-healing and symmetry-breaking terms, with initial overlap determining the Mpemba effect strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding anomalous relaxation effects in quantum systems is important for advancing our knowledge in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and quantum information theory. The paper provides a unifying framework which could open new avenues in theoretical physics and information science.

Method: The paper uses resource theories from thermodynamics and information theory to model Mpemba effects. Modes of asymmetry are analyzed to capture the behavior in different quantum and classical scenarios.

Result: The unified resource-theoretical framework explains both thermal and symmetry-restoring Mpemba effects, showing connections between resource consumption and anomalous relaxation dynamics. Initial overlaps with dynamics modes predict the presence of Mpemba-like effects.

Conclusion: The research offers a comprehensive understanding of Mpemba effects, establishing a link between resource theories and non-equilibrium dynamics, potentially useful for future studies in quantum thermodynamics and information processing.

Abstract: The Mpemba effect originally referred to the observation that, under certain
thermalizing dynamics, initially hotter samples can cool faster than colder
ones. This effect has since been generalized to other anomalous relaxation
behaviors even beyond classical domains, such as symmetry restoration in
quantum systems. This work demonstrates that resource theories, widely employed
in information theory, provide a unified organizing principle to frame Mpemba
physics. We show how the conventional thermal Mpemba effect arises naturally
from the resource theory of athermality, while its symmetry-restoring
counterpart is fully captured by the resource theories of asymmetry. Leveraging
the framework of modes of asymmetry, we demonstrate that the Mpemba effect due
to symmetry restoration is governed by the initial overlap with the slowest
symmetry-restoring mode -- mirroring the role of the slowest Liouvillian
eigenmode in thermal Mpemba dynamics. Through this resource-theoretical
formalism, we uncover the connection between these seemingly disparate effects
and show that the dynamics of thermalization naturally splits into a
symmetry-respecting and a symmetry-breaking term.

Method: 研究使用了70个超导量子位的二维量子模拟器，通过观察不平衡量的消减情况来研究不同规模系统下的物理行为。

Result: 发现随着系统规模从21、42增长到70个量子位，不平衡量的消减变得更明显，支持二维系统出现了 Many-Body Delocalization，反转了MBL在二维系统可能存在的疑问。

Conclusion: 二维系统MBL和很多体散射的界限被打破，为理解高维复杂量子系统提供新视角。

Abstract: Quantum many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder can exhibit a
non-equilibrium phenomenon, known as the many-body localization (MBL), which is
distinct from conventional thermalization. While the MBL regime has been
extensively studied in one dimension, its existence in higher dimensions
remains elusive, challenged by the avalanche instability. Here, using a
70-qubit two-dimensional (2D) superconducting quantum simulator, we
experimentally explore the robustness of the MBL regime in controlled
finite-size 2D systems. We observe that the decay of imbalance becomes more
pronounced with increasing system sizes, scaling up from 21, 42 to 70 qubits,
with a relatively large disorder strength, and for the first time, provide an
evidence for the many-body delocalization in 2D disordered systems. Our
experimental results are consistent with the avalanche theory that predicts the
instability of MBL regime beyond one spatial dimension. This work establishes a
scalable platform for probing high-dimensional non-equilibrium phases of matter
and their finite-size effects using superconducting quantum circuits.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to deliver large advantages on
computational tasks, but advantages for practical tasks are not yet achievable
with current hardware. Quantum sensing is an entirely separate quantum
technology that can provide its own kind of a quantum advantage. In this
Perspective, we explain how the merger of quantum sensing with quantum
computing has recently given rise to the notion of quantum computational
sensing, and a new kind of quantum advantage: a quantum computational-sensing
advantage. This advantage can be realized with far lower hardware requirements
than purely computational quantum advantage. We explain how several recent
proposals and experiments can be understood as quantum computational sensing,
and discuss categorizations of the general architectures that
quantum-computational-sensing protocols can have. We conclude with an outlook
on open questions and the prospects for quantum computational sensors and
quantum computational-sensing advantage.

Motivation: 研究极化子动力学对耦合量子系统的重要性，尤其是在弱耦合情况下CRW效应对动态的影响。

Method: 通过分析Dicke或Pauli-Fierz模型中的反转向量项，推导出极化子激发态的动力学行为，特别是在高激发态中观察振荡特性。

Result: 在弱耦合条件下，CRW效应显著影响极化子的Rabi振荡，导致新的振荡模式和 beating效应，特别是在高激发态中。

Conclusion: CRW效应在弱耦合量子光学中不可忽视，对极化子动力学和实验观察有重要影响。

Abstract: Cavity polaritons, quasiparticles formed by coherent light-matter coupling,
are at the heart of fundamental concepts of quantum optics. The quintessential
signature of this coherent coupling is the Rabi oscillation, which results from
the neglect of the counter-rotating-wave (CRW) effect in the weak-coupling
regime. The goal of this letter is to predict resonant beatings that envelop
the Rabi oscillation on the second or higher excitation manifold. These
polariton beatings arise from the CRW term in the Dicke or Pauli-Fierz model
and are directly correlated with the asymmetry in polariton eigenenergies. Our
findings highlight the relevance of the CRW effect even in the weak-coupling
regime, offer novel perspectives about coherent polariton dynamics, and shed
new light on experiments of coupled quantum systems.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses modifying sequential quantum measurements to address inconsistencies in joint probability computations, proposing a quasiprobability Born rule extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to resolve inconsistencies in quantum measurement probabilities, potentially offering new insights into spacetime quantum mechanics.

Method: Uses mathematical analysis of sequential measurements and proposes a correction term to modify Born rule applicability.

Result: Introduces a modified Born rule for sequential measurements using a bipartite operator and a correction term.

Conclusion: The correction term provides a framework for spacetime quantum state modeling, addressing Born rule limitations.

Abstract: Contrary to the joint probabilities associated with measurements performed on
spacelike separated quantum systems -- which are defined in terms of the Born
rule -- the joint probabilities associated with the outcomes of
\emph{sequential} measurements on a quantum system may not in general be
consistently computed in terms of the trace of a fixed operator multiplied by a
tensor product of projectors. However, in this work we show that if one
modifies the probabilities associated with two-point sequential measurements by
a correction term which accounts for state disturbance due to the initial
measurement, then one obtains a quasiprobability distribution which is uniquely
encoded by a bipartite operator which may be viewed as a spatiotemporal quantum
state, thus yielding a spatiotemporal extension of the Born rule. Moreover, we
prove that such a correction term may be viewed as an obstruction to the
existence of a Born rule for the joint probabilities associated with sequential
measurements, as we show that such a Born rule exists only when the
probabilities and the aforementioned quasiprobabilities in fact coincide. We
also show that when the notion of Bayesian inversion for quantum channels is
applied in conjunction with the spatiotemporal Born rule, one naturally arrives
at a quasiprobabilistic Bayes' rule for sequential measurements.

Abstract: Quantum capacity quantifies the amount of quantum information that can be
transmitted by a quantum channel with an arbitrary small probability of error.
Mathematically, the quantum capacity is given by an asymptotic formula
involving the one-shot quantum capacity of the associated channel, which, due
to purely quantum effects such as superadditivity of one-shot quantum capacity,
is rarely computable. The one-shot quantum capacity is mathematically
characterized in terms of optimizing an entropic quantity referred to as
coherent information over all possible input states of a channel, the
computation of which also tends to be intractable due to the difficulty of
optimizing the coherent information. In this work, we develop perturbative
methods for analyzing the behavior of coherent information of a quantum channel
with respect to small perturbations of the input state. By doing so, we are
able to derive three general criteria for determining whether an input state
yields suboptimal coherent information. We then show how our criteria yield
sufficient conditions for superadditivity of one-shot quantum capacity, and
also for detecting a positive gap between one-shot private capacity and
one-shot quantum capacity. The utility of our criteria is illustrated through
examples, which yield new results regarding the one-shot quantum capacity of
qubit depolarizing channels, Pauli channels and dephrasure channels.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the spectral decomposition of the density matrix formed by t copies of Haar random states, real versus complex, and applies the findings to improve lower bounds in quantum state approximation and imaginarity testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the spectral properties of quantum states is fundamental for applications in quantum information theory, such as designing efficient quantum algorithms or protocols. The comparison between real and complex Haar random states can lead to improved understanding of quantum state distinguishability and applications in quantum resource theories.

Method: The authors perform exact analytical computations of the spectral decomposition of the density matrix formed by taking t copies of a d-dimensional quantum state sampled via the Haar measure on the orthogonal group. By deriving the exact trace distance between the t-fold copies of real and complex Haar random states, they then deduce the implications for the lower bounds on the approximation parameter of real-valued t-designs and the lower bound on the number of copies required for imaginarity testing.

Result: Exact analytical expressions for the trace distance and spectral decomposition of the density matrix are derived, leading to improved lower bounds in the approximation parameter for real-valued t-designs and reducing the required number of copies for imaginarity testing.

Conclusion: The findings bridge a gap in the understanding of real and complex quantum states, offering practical improvements in quantum resource certification and entanglement testing, thus advancing quantum computing and information processing applications.

Abstract: Haar random states are fundamental objects in quantum information theory and
quantum computing. We study the density matrix resulting from sampling $t$
copies of a $d$-dimensional quantum state according to the Haar measure on the
orthogonal group. In particular, we analytically compute its spectral
decomposition. This allows us to compute exactly the trace distance between
$t$-copies of a real Haar random state and $t$-copies of a complex Haar random
state. Using this we show a lower-bound on the approximation parameter of
real-valued state $t$-designs and improve the lower-bound on the number of
copies required for imaginarity testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to bridge the gap between quantum and classical descriptions by developing tools to identify and quantify contextuality.

Method: The method involves using stochastic linear maps within a marginal-scenario framework to model invasive measurements and relate probabilities outside a classical polytope.

Result: The approach allows systematic simulation of contextuality from classical resources, identifying map properties, and quantifying contextuality based on invasiveness cost.

Conclusion: This framework offers new insights into contextuality, facilitating its exploitation and quantification in quantum-to-classical contrast studies.

Abstract: Contextuality is a defining feature that separates the quantum from the
classical descriptions of physical systems. Building upon the marginal-scenario
framework, we introduce a general method to characterize contextuality through
stochastic linear maps. These maps effectively model invasive measurements on
an otherwise classical statistics, relating probabilities within the
noncontextuality polytope that includes all classical probabilities to
probabilities outside the polytope. Our approach provides a systematic way to
simulate contextuality from classical resources, enabling the identification of
the structural properties of such maps. Moreover, it offers a quantification of
contextuality based on the invasiveness cost, i.e., a property intrinsic to the
maps themselves, rather than to the probabilities they act upon.

Abstract: As quantum hardware rapidly advances toward the early fault-tolerant era, a
key challenge is to develop quantum algorithms that are not only theoretically
sound but also hardware-friendly on near-term devices. In this work, we propose
a quantum algorithm for solving linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
with a provable runtime guarantee. Our algorithm uses only a single ancilla
qubit, and is locality preserving, i.e., when the coefficient matrix of the ODE
is $k$-local, the algorithm only needs to implement the time evolution of
$(k+1)$-local Hamiltonians. We also discuss the connection between our proposed
algorithm and Lindbladian simulation as well as its application to the
interacting Hatano-Nelson model, a widely studied non-Hermitian model with rich

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increase in superconducting qubit research and the need for improved fabrication methods highlight challenges in materials and surface cleaning, necessitating an alternative solution.

Method: The authors developed an inorganic mask using SiO2/Si3N4 for Josephson junction fabrication, which can withstand aggressive conditions. They used shadow evaporation for qubit creation and cleaned the device with vapor hydrofluoric acid, selectively etching SiO2.

Result: Successful demonstration of the method with demonstrated lifetimes ranging from approximately 75±11 μs to 44±8 μs, showing compatibility with state-of-the-art qubits.

Conclusion: The inorganic mask offers a promising alternative with enhanced stability, validating the approach for further development in superconducting quantum devices.

Abstract: Improvements in circuit design and more recently in materials and surface
cleaning have contributed to a rapid development of coherent superconducting
qubits. However, organic resists commonly used for shadow evaporation of
Josephson junctions (JJs) pose limitations due to residual contamination, poor
thermal stability and compatibility under typical surface-cleaning conditions.
To provide an alternative, we developed an inorganic SiO$_2$/Si$_3$N$_4$
on-chip stencil lithography mask for JJ fabrication. The stencil mask is
resilient to aggressive cleaning agents and it withstands high temperatures up
to 1200\textdegree{}C, thereby opening new avenues for JJ material exploration
and interface optimization. To validate the concept, we performed shadow
evaporation of Al-based transmon qubits followed by stencil mask lift-off using
vapor hydrofluoric acid, which selectively etches SiO$_2$. We demonstrate
average $T_1 \approx 75 \pm 11~\SI{}{\micro\second}$ over a 200 MHz frequency
range in multiple cool-downs for one device, and $T_1 \approx 44\pm
8~\SI{}{\micro\second}$ for a second device. These results confirm the
compatibility of stencil lithography with state-of-the-art superconducting
quantum devices and motivate further investigations into materials engineering,
film deposition and surface cleaning techniques.

Abstract: Compiling Bell games under cryptographic assumptions replaces the need for
physical separation, allowing nonlocality to be probed with a single untrusted
device. While Kalai et al. (STOC'23) showed that this compilation preserves
quantum advantages, its quantitative quantum soundness has remained an open
problem. We address this gap with two primary contributions. First, we
establish the first quantitative quantum soundness bounds for every bipartite
compiled Bell game whose optimal quantum strategy is finite-dimensional: any
polynomial-time prover's score in the compiled game is negligibly close to the
game's ideal quantum value. More generally, for all bipartite games we show
that the compiled score cannot significantly exceed the bounds given by a newly
formalized sequential Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in (NPA) hierarchy. Second, we
provide a full characterization of this sequential NPA hierarchy, establishing
it as a robust numerical tool that is of independent interest. Finally, for
games without finite-dimensional optimal strategies, we explore the necessity
of NPA approximation error for quantitatively bounding their compiled scores,
linking these considerations to the complexity conjecture
$\mathrm{MIP}^{\mathrm{co}}=\mathrm{coRE}$ and open challenges such as quantum
homomorphic encryption correctness for "weakly commuting" quantum registers.

Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA) have emerged as
highly versatile devices, offering broadband amplification with quantum-limited
noise performance. They hold significant potential for addressing the readout
bottleneck in prototype quantum computers, enabling scalability. Key challenges
with this technology include achieving sufficient gain with minimal gain ripple
while maintaining low noise performance. Efficient phase matching between a
weak signal and a strong pump over the entire length of the TWPA is critical to
overcoming these challenges. We present an experimental demonstration of the
inverse Kerr phase matching technique in a TWPA, first proposed in Ref. Phys.
Rev. Appl. 4, 024014. This method addresses several limitations of conventional
dispersion engineering approaches of phase matching in the four-wave mixing
parametric process in TWPAs. Most notably the existence of an unusable region
of gain near the pump frequency which typically corresponds to the region of
most optimal phase matching and maximum gain. The inverse Kerr phase matching
approach, allows for greater frequency separation between the region of optimal
gain and pump, \textit{in situ} tunability of the pump, minimal gain ripple,
and a compact footprint which reduces losses. A TWPA employing the inverse Kerr
phase matching technique experimentally demonstrated 20 dB of gain over a 3 GHz
instantaneous bandwidth, with a tunable bandwidth of 8 GHz, minimal gain
ripple, and near quantum-limited noise performance, with 1.5 photons of added
noise.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding couplings between magnon modes through cavity systems is crucial for quantum information and hybrid technologies. This study contributes to tunable interactions and potential applications.

Method: The authors used input-output formalism to derive equations, simulating their findings with numerical methods.

Result: They found classical synchronization in a driven system, quantum synchronization (degrade with higher temperatures), and identified cavity-mediated coupling for tunable interactions.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for tunable magnonic coupling devices with applications in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven
magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon
mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with
the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by
using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization
emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that
thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of
low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable
magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum
information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.

Abstract: Minimal Kitaev chains host Majorana quasiparticles, which, although not
topologically protected, exhibit spatial nonlocality and hence expected to be
useful for quantum information tasks. In this work, we consider two- and
three-site Kitaev chains and investigate the dynamics of bipartite and
multipartite entanglement by means of concurrence and geometric measure of
entanglement. In two-site Kitaev chains, we find that maximally entangled
states can robustly emerge, with their stability and periodicity highly
controllable by the interplay between the superconducting pair potential and
the onsite energies. At the finely tuned sweet spot, where Majorana
quasiparticles appear, the system exhibits oscillations between separable and
entangled states, whereas detuning introduces tunable valleys in the
entanglement dynamics. Extending to the three-site Kitaev chain, we uncover
rich bipartite and multipartite entanglement by generalizing the concepts of
concurrence and geometric measure of entanglement. At the sweet spot, the
Majorana quasiparticles emerging at the edges suppress concurrence between the
edges, while a finite detuning is able to restore it. Depending on the initial
state, the three-site Kitaev chain can dynamically generate either a maximally
entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state or an imperfect W-type state
exhibiting multipartite entanglement, although a (maximally entangled) pure W
state cannot be realised due to parity constraints. Our results provide a
resource for generating and characterising highly entangled states in minimal
Kitaev chains, with potential relevance for quantum applications.

Result: 实验结果表明，QuBound与现有方法相比，预测区间更精确，加速比超过10x，覆盖范围扩大近10倍。

Conclusion: QuBound方法为量子计算环境中的系统管理和应用优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum computing has significantly advanced in recent years, boasting
devices with hundreds of quantum bits (qubits), hinting at its potential
quantum advantage over classical computing. Yet, noise in quantum devices poses
significant barriers to realizing this supremacy. Understanding noise's impact
is crucial for reproducibility and application reuse; moreover, the
next-generation quantum-centric supercomputing essentially requires efficient
and accurate noise characterization to support system management (e.g., job
scheduling), where ensuring correct functional performance (i.e., fidelity) of
jobs on available quantum devices can even be higher-priority than traditional
objectives. However, noise fluctuates over time, even on the same quantum
device, which makes predicting the computational bounds for on-the-fly noise is
vital. Noisy quantum simulation can offer insights but faces efficiency and
scalability issues. In this work, we propose a data-driven workflow, namely
QuBound, to predict computational performance bounds. It decomposes historical
performance traces to isolate noise sources and devises a novel encoder to
embed circuit and noise information processed by a Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) network. For evaluation, we compare QuBound with a state-of-the-art
learning-based predictor, which only generates a single performance value
instead of a bound. Experimental results show that the result of the existing
approach falls outside of performance bounds, while all predictions from our
QuBound with the assistance of performance decomposition better fit the bounds.
Moreover, QuBound can efficiently produce practical bounds for various circuits
with over 106 speedup over simulation; in addition, the range from QuBound is
over 10x narrower than the state-of-the-art analytical approach.

TL;DR: This paper compares three quantum control protocols, highlighting NARP's benefits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving photon emission for quantum technologies is a key challenge. This paper addresses it by comparing Rabi, ARP, and NARP.

Method: Theoretical study using parameter mapping, Lindblad master equation, and time-resolved emission analysis.

Result: All schemes create similar photon pulses, but NARP offers high fidelity and spectral separation.

Conclusion: NARP should be the preferred protocol for next-gen quantum light sources.

Abstract: The development of high-performance quantum technologies relies on the
ability to prepare the quantum states of solid-state emitters with high
fidelity while cleanly separating the emitted photons from the driving field.
Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical comparison of three single-pulse
coherent control protocols: resonant Rabi oscillations, adiabatic rapid passage
(ARP), and notch-filtered ARP (NARP). To establish an ideal performance
baseline, we first map the parameter spaces for each protocol in a closed
system, identifying the regions of robust population inversion. We then use a
Lindblad master equation to compute the time-resolved emission spectra in the
presence of decoherence. Our results show that while all three schemes can
generate identical, transform-limited Lorentzian photons, NARP uniquely
combines the high-fidelity robustness of adiabatic passage with intrinsic
spectral separability. Our findings, which align with the work on NARP by
Wilbur et al., establish a clear design framework for engineering the next
generation of quantum light sources.

Abstract: In the fields of quantum mechanics and quantum information science, the
traces of reduced density matrix powers play a crucial role in the study of
quantum systems and have numerous important applications. In this paper, we
propose a universal framework to simultaneously estimate the traces of the
$2$nd to the $n$th powers of a reduced density matrix using a single quantum
circuit with $n$ copies of the quantum state. Specifically, our approach
leverages the controlled SWAP test and establishes explicit formulas connecting
measurement probabilities to these traces. We further develop two algorithms: a
purely quantum method and a hybrid quantum-classical approach combining
Newton-Girard iteration. Rigorous analysis via Hoeffding inequality
demonstrates the method's efficiency, requiring only
$M=O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\log(\frac{n}{\delta})\right)$ measurements to
achieve precision $\epsilon$ with confidence $1-\delta$. Additionally, we
explore various applications including the estimation of nonlinear functions
and the representation of entanglement measures. Numerical simulations are
conducted for two maximally entangled states, the GHZ state and the W state, to
validate the proposed method.

### [89] [Quantum metrology in a nonlinear-interferometer with feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17160)
*Shivani Singh,Craig S. Hamilton,Igor Jex*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes a nonlinear interferometer with feedback that improves phase estimation. Two feedback schemes are analyzed, both show increased quantum Fisher information (QFI) with more feedback. The QFI in both cases is sensitive to vacuum losses. In low loss, their scheme performs better than the standard SU(1,1) interferometer. The feedback helps achieve minimum phase variance for small phases, and even enhances QFI for large phases by alternating between squeezing and anti-squeezing operators every few loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper deals with quantum metrology specifically in the context of nonlinear interferometers with feedback. The authors propose a new setup and analyze its performance regarding phase estimation sensitivity and resource efficiency, which are key considerations in quantum metrology.

Method: The authors analyze two feedback schemes in a nonlinear interferometer by examining the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the sensitivity to photon losses. They use theoretical analysis to compare the performance of their proposed scheme with the standard SU(1,1) interferometer.

Result: The findings show that the proposed scheme outperforms the standard interferometer in low loss conditions. The phase estimation achieves minimum variance, and the feedback scheme can enhance QFI further by switching between squeezing and anti-squeezing operators for larger phase values.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the proposed nonlinear interferometer with feedback offers improved phase estimation capabilities, particularly under low loss scenarios, by utilizing feedback and adaptive squeezing to optimize resource usage and sensitivity.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a nonlinear interferometer with feedback loops and
explore its efficiency for phase estimation. We analyse two feedback schemes,
one where both modes of the interferometer are fed-back into the device and
another where only one mode is fed-back. The quantum Fisher information (QFI)
for phase estimation in each feedback scheme increases with each feedback loop,
and similar to the standard SU(1,1) nonlinear interferometer, phase estimation
in this scheme is sensitive to photon loss when the inputs are vacuum state. In
terms of resources, we show that, in the low-loss regime, our scheme performs
better than standard nonlinear interferometer. The feedback scheme provides the
minimum phase variance when the unknown phase is small. We have also provided a
special case where feedback scheme provided enhanced QFI even for large phase
values. This is achieved by switching between squeezing and anti-squeezing
operators after every few loops.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improves quantum gate efficiency which is crucial for quantum computing advancements.

Method: Introduction of p-SWAP, design using CNOT gates, experiments on IBM quantum computer.

Result: 2 CNOTs, 23% cost reduction, 26% depth minimization.

Conclusion: Enhanced gate for quantum computing applications.

Abstract: A new Boolean-Phase swapping gate is presented with improved quantum
generality and cost-effectiveness. Our swapping gate is termed the "p-SWAP
gate", where p is the phase difference selected for a set of swapped qubits.
The phase p is expressed in radians and $-{\pi}~{\leq}$ p ${\leq}~+{\pi}$. The
generality of p-SWAP gate is demonstrated for Phase applications for selected
values of p and for Boolean applications when the value of p is ignored. The
cost-effectiveness of p-SWAP gate follows from the lower quantum cost and depth
of its final realized (transpiled) quantum circuit, when compared to the
standard SWAP gate composed of three Feynman (CNOT) gates. Specifically, our
presented p-SWAP gate utilizes only two CNOT gates. The quantum circuit of the
p-SWAP gate is visually designed using our previously developed Bloch sphere
approach. Experimentally, after transpilation for an IBM quantum computer, the
transpiled p-SWAP gate shows an approximate 23% quantum cost reduction and an
approximate 26% depth minimization compared to the transpiled standard SWAP
gate.

Abstract: We study the universal properties of the Lanczos algorithm applied to
finite-size many-body quantum systems. Focusing on autocorrelation functions of
local operators and on their infinite-time behaviour at finite size, we
conjecture that in the large $n$ limit, the ratios between consecutive Lanczos
coefficients should have specific scalings with the size of the lattice that we
make precise and that depend on the hydrodynamic tail of the autocorrelation
function. The scaling associated with strong or approximate zero-modes is also
discussed. We support our conjecture with a numerical study of different
models.

*Techapon Kampu,Salvatore De Vincenzo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper evaluates boundary conditions for a Majorana particle in 1D and shows how specific current densities can lead to conserved quantities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses issues in relativistic quantum mechanics, specifically with the Klein-Fock-Gordon equation, aiming to resolve conflicts in current densities and boundary conditions for a Majorana particle.

Method: The authors analyze 1D KFG equations and apply Majorana conditions alongside pseudo self-adjointness of the FV Hamiltonian, deriving specific boundary conditions and observing conserved quantities.

Result: By using a particular energy current density, the study demonstrates that certain boundary conditions lead to conserved quantities, resolving conflicts with previous findings about current densities in relativistic quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: The research shows that when using a specific energy current density along with Majorana conditions, the Majorana 1D KFG particle can have conserved quantities, highlighting the important role of boundary conditions in such systems.

Abstract: Real solutions of the 1D Klein-Fock-Gordon (KFG) equation automatically
cancel out the usual two-vector current density; consequently, the respective
continuity equation is trivially satisfied, and a globally conserved quantity
cannot be obtained. The latter is a well-known result in relativistic quantum
mechanics. Additionally, distinguishing between impermeable and permeable
boundary conditions (BCs) at a point is not possible; for the latter type of
BC, the pertinent current density cannot be zero at that point. We solve these
first-quantized conflicts in detail by using a particular nontrivial local
observable -- an energy current density -- that allows us to characterize a
strictly neutral 1D KFG particle, i.e., a 1D KFG-Majorana (KFGM) particle, when
it is confined to an interval and when it is, say, in an interval with
transparent walls. All the BCs for this system are extracted from the pseudo
self-adjointness of the Feshbach-Villars (FV) Hamiltonian plus two Majorana
conditions. We also show that this energy current density and a nontrivial
energy density satisfy a continuity equation when the Lorentz scalar
interaction present in the 1D KFG equations is time independent; in addition,
they always lead to a conserved quantity. Moreover, this energy current density
can characterize all available confining and nonconfining BCs. In contrast, the
commonly used energy current density -- a component of the energy-momentum
tensor of the system -- cannot do so for all the BCs. Additionally, this latter
quantity and its respective energy density -- another component of the
energy-momentum tensor -- do not necessarily lead to a conserved quantity. Our
results dramatically highlight the important role played by the BCs when they
are imposed on a system in which particles occupy a finite region.

Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems
are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient
information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum
walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic
topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective
Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless
topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically
nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to
split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit
markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat
bands emerging exclusively $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We
analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped
flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of
Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at
the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle
graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against
moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against
phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and
versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge
states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for
fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Abstract: Certifying the correct functioning of a unitary channel is a critical step
toward reliable quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate
the query complexity of the unitary channel certification task: testing whether
a given $d$-dimensional unitary channel is identical to or $\varepsilon$-far in
diamond distance from a target unitary operation. We show that incoherent
algorithms-those without quantum memory-require $\Omega(d/\varepsilon^2)$
queries, matching the known upper bound. In addition, for general quantum
algorithms, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and
present a matching quantum algorithm based on quantum singular value
transformation, establishing a tight query complexity of
$\Theta(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$. On the other hand, notably, we prove that for
almost all unitary channels drawn from a natural average-case ensemble,
certification can be accomplished with only $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ queries. This
demonstrates an exponential query complexity gap between worst- and
average-case scenarios in certification, implying that certification is
significantly easier for most unitary channels encountered in practice.
Together, our results offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for
verifying quantum processes.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决量子去克隆问题提供了一种有效方案，展示了无限资源在虚拟克隆 scenario下的潜力，为未来应用提供了指导。

Abstract: The inherent limitations of physical processes prevent the copying of
arbitrary quantum states. Furthermore, even if we only aim to clone two
distinct quantum states, it remains impossible unless they are mutually
orthogonal. To overcome this limitation, we propose a virtual-cloning protocol
that bypasses the restrictions imposed by the quantum no-cloning theorem.
Specifically, we begin by outlining the general framework for virtual cloning
and deriving a necessary and sufficient criterion for the existence of a
virtual operation capable of simultaneously cloning a set of states.
Subsequently, through an analysis of the simulation cost of the virtual-cloning
process, we demonstrate that the problem of identifying an optimal
virtual-cloning protocol can be cast as a semidefinite programming problem.
Finally, we establish a connection between virtual cloning and state
discrimination, from which universal bounds on the optimal cloning cost are
derived.

shares such that shares from qualified sets can recover the secret state and
shares from other forbidden sets reveal nothing about the secret state; we
study the setting where there are both classical shares and quantum shares. We
show that the quantum secret sharing problem with both classical and quantum
shares is feasible if and only if any two qualified sets have some quantum
share in common. Next, for threshold quantum secret sharing where there are
$N_1$ classical shares, $N_2$ quantum shares and qualified sets consist of any
$K_1$ (or more) classical shares and any $K_2 > N_2/2$ (or more) quantum
shares, we show that to share $1$ qubit secret, each classical share needs to
be at least $2$ bits and each quantum share needs to be at least $1$ qubit.
Finally, we characterize the minimum share sizes for quantum secret sharing
with at most $2$ classical shares and at most $2$ quantum shares. The converse
proofs rely on quantum information inequalities and the achievable schemes use
classical secret sharing, (encrypted) quantum secret sharing with only quantum
shares, superdense coding, treating quantum digits as classical digits, and
their various combinations.

### [99] [Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17421)
*Hrvoje Vrcan,Johan H. Mentink*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study highlights that numerical instabilities in simulating quantum dynamics using neural networks with TDVP occur despite smooth observable behavior. Methods like using Fisher matrix regularization and geometric recasting don't prevent the issue. Alternative methods are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving quantum simulations using machine learning approaches remains a challenge, especially in handling complex, nonequilibrium dynamics.

Method: Using restricted Boltzmann machines, the researchers compared TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods, analyzing the impact of quench strength and noise on numerical stability.

Result: Numerical breakdown occurs without observable irregularities. Various TDVP formulations showed consistent instability.

Conclusion: Explicit time integration for TDVP isn't reliable for strong nonequilibrium dynamics, necessitating new methods.

Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for
simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational
ans\"atze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural
networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several
sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum
dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the
computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Using the
restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by
TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench
strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a
numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that
physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon
appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those
that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric
properties to recast the equation of motion. We conclude that alternative
methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of
explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly
nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for multipartite entanglement characterization
based on the conditional gradient (CG) method, incorporating both fast
heuristic detection and rigorous witness construction with numerical error
control. Our method enables entanglement certification in quantum systems of up

its power by closing the gap between entanglement and separability bounds in
white noise robustness benchmarks for a class of bound entangled states.
Furthermore, the framework extends to entanglement robustness under general
quantum noise channels, providing accurate thresholds in cases beyond the reach
of previous algorithmic methods. These results position CG methods as a

Abstract: Understanding how intrinsic decoherence affects the interplay between
geometry, dynamics, and entanglement in quantum systems is a central challenge
in quantum information science. In this work, we develop a unified framework
that explores this interplay for a pair of interacting spins governed by an
XXZ-type Heisenberg model under an external magnetic field and intrinsic
decoherence. We quantify entanglement using the concurrence measure and examine
its evolution under decoherence, revealing that intrinsic noise rapidly
suppresses entanglement as it increases. We then analyze the Hilbert-Schmidt
and Bures distances between quantum states and show how both the degree of
entanglement and the noise rate modulate these distances and their associated
quantum speeds. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Hilbert Schmidt speed is
more responsive to entanglement and coherence loss than the Bures speed, making
it a powerful tool for probing the geometry of quantum dynamics. Moreover, we
solve the quantum brachistochrone problem in the presence of intrinsic
decoherence, identifying the minimal evolution time and the corresponding
optimal entangled states. Finally, we explore the geometric phase accumulated
during the system's evolution. Our results show that decoherence hinders
geometric phase accumulation, while entanglement counteracts this effect,
enhancing phase stability.

Abstract: We investigate the optimization of graph topologies for quantum sensing
networks designed to estimate weak magnetic fields. The sensors are modeled as
spin systems governed by a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian in thermal
equilibrium at low temperatures. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we evolve
network topologies to maximize a perturbative spectral sensitivity measure,
which serves as the fitness function for the GA. For the best-performing
graphs, we compute the corresponding quantum Fisher information (QFI) to assess
the ultimate bounds on estimation precision. To enable efficient scaling, we
use the GA-generated data to train a deep neural network, allowing
extrapolation to larger graph sizes where direct computation becomes
prohibitive. Our results show that while both the fitness function and QFI
initially increase with system size, the QFI exhibits a clear non-monotonic
behavior - saturating and eventually declining beyond a critical graph size.
This reflects the loss of superlinear scaling of the QFI, as the narrowing of
the energy gap signals a crossover to classical scaling of the QFI with system
size. The effect is reminiscent of the microeconomic law of diminishing
returns: beyond an optimal graph size, further increases yield reduced sensing
performance. This saturation and decline in precision are particularly
pronounced under Kac scaling, where both the QFI and spin squeezing plateau or
degrade with increasing system size. We also attribute observed even-odd
oscillations in the spectral sensitivity and QFI to quantum interference
effects in spin phase space, as confirmed by our phase-space analysis. These
findings highlight the critical role of optimizing interaction topology -
rather than simply increasing network size - and demonstrate the potential of
hybrid evolutionary and learning-based approaches for designing
high-performance quantum sensors.

Abstract: The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in
scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating
large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable
future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we
introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning
models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor
with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two
predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum
processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential
in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a
quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling
efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of
transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet
symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the
predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of
magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,
quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish
predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of
advanced quantum processors.

Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) based on semiconductor laser phase
noise are an inexpensive and efficient resource for true random numbers.
Commercially available technology allows for designing QRNG setups tailored to
specific use cases. However, it is important to constantly monitor whether the
QRNG is performing according to the desired security standards in terms of
independence and uniform distribution of the generated numbers. This is
especially important in cryptographic applications. This paper presents a
standardized test scheme that helps to assess the acceptable operating
conditions of a semiconductor laser for QRNG operation, using commonly
accessible methods. This can be used for system monitoring, but crucially also
to help the user choose the laser diode which better suits their needs. Two
specific quality measurements, ensuring proper operation of the device, are
explained and discussed. Setup-specific approaches for setting an acceptance
boundary for these measures are presented and exemplary measurement data
showing their effectiveness is given. By following the comprehensible procedure
described here, a QRNG test environment tailored to specific security

Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum communication networks necessitates
the efficient distribution of quantum states to enable advanced cryptographic
applications and distributed tasks. Multipartite entanglement is a key resource
in many of these proposals, yet its generation is experimentally challenging,
especially in noisy and lossy networks. While a substantial body of work
focuses on the distribution of multi-partite entanglement in star-like
topologies, practical implementations often rely on linear network structures
constrained by existing infrastructure. In this work, we investigate the
generation of high-fidelity multipartite entangled states in a realistic
quantum network, leveraging the existing infrastructure of the Q-net-Q project
- a real-world long-distance link connecting Berlin and Frankfurt via seven
trusted relay nodes. Given that only bipartite entanglement sources are
available in our setting and that the network is highly lossy, we explore the
role of quantum memories in enhancing multi-partite entanglement distribution
and identify key performance requirements. Furthermore, we analyze the
feasibility and performance of cryptographic primitives - including (Anonymous)
Conference Key Agreement and Quantum Secret Sharing - highlighting the
scenarios where the use of multipartite entanglement yields clear advantages.

Abstract: The rise of quantum networks has revolutionized domains such as
communication, sensing, and cybersecurity. Despite this progress, current
quantum network systems remain limited in scale, are highly
application-specific (e.g., for quantum key distribution), and lack a clear
road map for global expansion. These limitations are largely driven by a
shortage of skilled professionals, limited accessibility to quantum
infrastructure, and the high complexity and cost associated with building and
operating quantum hardware. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an
open-access software-based quantum network virtualization platform designed to
facilitate scalable and remote interaction with quantum hardware. The system is
built around a cloud application that virtualizes the core hardware components
of a lab-scale quantum network testbed, including the time tagger and optical
switch, enabling users to perform coincidence counts of the photon
entanglements while ensuring fair resource allocation. The fairness is ensured
by employing the Hungarian Algorithm to allocate nearly equal effective
entanglement rates among users. We provide implementation details and
performance analysis from the perspectives of hardware, software, and cloud
platform, which demonstrates the functionality and efficiency of the developed
prototype.

Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently solving NP-Complete graph problems using quantum computing methods, highlighting the potential of Gaussian boson sampling. It aims to demonstrate a practical approach that can outperform traditional methods.

Conclusion: Gaussian boson sampling shows promise as a quantum computing approach for graph theory challenges, offering enhanced performance over classical methods for larger graphs.

Abstract: We describe an efficient, scalable Gaussian boson sampler based on a

TL;DR: The paper presents a systematic approach to bounding the quantum values of compiled nonlocal games using semidefinite programming and 'nice' sum-of-squares certificates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum soundness in nonlocal games is crucial for cryptography, and this work provides a method to quantitatively bound the quantum values, advancing the field.

Method: Extends previous work by introducing 'nice' sum-of-squares certificates and building a semidefinite program hierarchy that converges to optimal values.

Result: A systematic framework is created that reproduces known bounds and provides a new bound based on the approach, leveraging cryptographic security parameters.

Conclusion: This method offers a robust tool for analyzing quantum soundness and potentially advancing cryptographic protocols.

Abstract: We continue the line of work initiated by Kalai et al. (STOC '23), studying
"compiled" nonlocal games played between a classical verifier and a single
quantum prover, with cryptography simulating the spatial separation between the
players. The central open question in this area is to understand the soundness
of this compiler against quantum strategies, and apart from results for
specific games, all that is known is the recent "qualitative" result of Kulpe
et al. (STOC '25) showing that the success probability of a quantum prover in
the compiled game is bounded by the game's quantum commuting-operator value in
the limit as the cryptographic security parameter goes to infinity. In this
work, we make progress towards a quantitative understanding of quantum
soundness for general games, by giving a concrete framework to bound the
quantum value of compiled nonlocal games. Building on the result of Kulpe et
al. together with the notion of "nice" sum-of-squares certificates, introduced
by Natarajan and Zhang (FOCS '23) to bound the value of the compiled CHSH game,
we extend the niceness framework and construct a hierarchy of semidefinite
programs that searches exclusively over nice certificates. We show that this
hierarchy converges to the optimal quantum value of the game. Additionally, we
present a transformation to make any degree-1 sum-of-squares certificate nice.
This approach provides a systematic method to reproduce all known bounds for
special classes of games together with Kulpe et al.'s bound for general games
from the same framework.

*Chenyi Zhang,Tao Shang,Xueyi Guo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Introduces a secure quantum compilation framework ECQCO that uses quantum homomorphic encryption and obfuscation to protect circuit functionality and topology on the quantum cloud side. The scheme maintains low computational overhead and high fidelity, as demonstrated by experimental results. More details below.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The advancement of quantum computing is accelerating, making quantum compilation a critical infrastructure between algorithm design and hardware implementation. Quantum cloud computing introduces unique security challenges, such as structural leakage and output predictability. There is a need for a secure compilation framework that ensures the safety of circuits both in terms of functionality and architecture while maintaining efficiency.

Method: The authors propose ECQCO, a scheme combining quantum homomorphic encryption with quantum circuit obfuscation techniques (specifically quantum indistinguishability obfuscation) to achieve secure compilation. They also integrate an adaptive decoupling obfuscation algorithm to suppress idle errors. The security claims are made under the quantum random oracle model, and the method involves benchmark testing on standard datasets to evaluate performance metrics like TVD and GED.

Result: The ECQCO scheme achieves information-theoretic security and computational indistinguishability. Experimental results show notable improvements in compilation security with metrics like TVD up to 0.7 and a normalized GED of 0.88. Additionally, the scheme introduces minimal increases in circuit depth and fidelity changes, indicating a practical balance between security and efficiency.

Conclusion: ECQCO provides a robust solution for quantum cloud compilation by addressing security concerns through encryption and obfuscation while maintaining compilation performance. This framework is the first of its kind, offering a practical trade-off between security and resource overhead. Future work could explore advanced quantum obfuscation methods or integrate machine learning to further enhance security and optimization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, quantum compilation has
become a crucial layer connecting high-level algorithms with physical hardware.
In quantum cloud computing, compilation is performed on the cloud side, which
exposes user circuits to potential risks such as structural leakage and output
predictability. To address these issues, we propose the encrypted-state quantum
compilation scheme based on quantum circuit obfuscation (ECQCO), the first
secure compilation framework tailored for the co-location of compilers and
quantum hardware. It applies quantum homomorphic encryption to conceal output
states and instantiates a structure obfuscation mechanism based on quantum
indistinguishability obfuscation, effectively protecting both functionality and
topology of the circuit. Additionally, an adaptive decoupling obfuscation
algorithm is designed to suppress potential idle errors while inserting pulse
operations. The proposed scheme achieves information-theoretic security and
guarantees computational indistinguishability under the quantum random oracle
model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ECQCO achieves a
TVD of up to 0.7 and a normalized GED of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage
security. Moreover, it introduces only a slight increase in circuit depth,
while keeping the average fidelity change within 1%, thus achieving a practical
balance between security and efficiency.

Abstract: We present a novel application of the Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) for
high-precision frequency estimation from free spin precession signals of
polarized $^3$He. Traditional approaches often rely on nonlinear least-squares
fitting, which can suffer from limited robustness to signal decay and
time-dependent frequency shifts. By contrast, our EKS-based method captures
both amplitude and frequency variations with minimal tuning, adapting
automatically to fluctuations via an expectation-maximization algorithm.
  We benchmark the technique in extensive simulations that emulate realistic
spin precession signals with exponentially decaying amplitudes and noisy
frequency drifts. Compared to least-squares fits with fixed block lengths, EKS
systematically reduces estimation errors, particularly when frequencies evolve
or signal-to-noise ratios are moderate to high. We further validate these
findings with experimental data from a free-precession decay $^3$He
magnetometer.
  Our results indicate that EKS-based analysis can substantially improve
precision in nuclear magnetic resonance-based magnetometry, where accurate
frequency estimation underpins absolute field determinations. This versatile
approach promises to enhance the stability and accuracy of future
high-precision measurements.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a method to translate variational quantum algorithm problems across different quantum simulators using a generic framework. The toolchain was tested with three use cases—ground state calculation for hydrogen, MaxCut, and TSP—showing successful cross-simulation translation. However, variational algorithms face limitations due to their long runtimes and high memory usage, which限制 their scaling potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges in comparing and running variational quantum algorithms across different simulators, which is crucial for advancing quantum computing research. The authors aim to provide a robust solution to streamline the process and leverage existing quantum hardware more effectively.

Method: The authors developed a framework that abstracts the problem definition, allowing consistent execution across different simulators. This framework used three distinct quantum problems—ground state, MaxCut, and TSP—to test its effectiveness. They likely evaluated performance metrics such as runtime, scalability, and result consistency across simulators.

Result: The results indicate that the framework successfully translates problem definitions between simulators. Variational algorithms, however, have limitations in scalability due to long runtimes and high memory consumption. Additionally,他们 explored utilizing techniques like job arrays to mitigate some of these performance issues.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable tool for researchers to cross-platform compare variational quantum algorithms efficiently. While the current limitations of variational algorithms hinder their scalability, the framework offers a foundation for future developments to overcome these challenges by utilizing techniques like job arrays and other optimizations.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are of special importance in the research on
quantum computing applications because of their applicability to current Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. The main building blocks of these
algorithms (among them, the definition of the Hamiltonian and of the ansatz,
the optimizer) define a relatively large parameter space, making the comparison
of results and performance between different approaches and software simulators
cumbersome and prone to errors. In this paper, we employ a generic description
of the problem, in terms of both Hamiltonian and ansatz, to port a problem
definition consistently among different simulators. Three use cases of
relevance for current quantum hardware (ground state calculation for the
Hydrogen molecule, MaxCut, Travelling Salesman Problem) have been run on a set
of HPC systems and software simulators to study the dependence of performance
on the runtime environment, the scalability of the simulation codes and the
mutual agreement of the physical results, respectively. The results show that
our toolchain can successfully translate a problem definition between different
simulators. On the other hand, variational algorithms are limited in their
scaling by the long runtimes with respect to their memory footprint, so they
expose limited parallelism to computation. This shortcoming is partially
mitigated by using techniques like job arrays. The potential of the parser tool
for exploring HPC performance and comparisons of results of variational
algorithm simulations is highlighted.

TL;DR: 研究如何从输入和输出态 reconstruct 量子门的酉矩阵，理想情况下用 two mixed states 或者 d+1 pure states 来重建酉矩阵，并将其扩展到近似的情况，考虑了 decoherence 的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子态转换中的酉矩阵重建方法，这对于量子计算中的故障容忍和优化至关重要。

Method: 基于输入和输出态的重建方法，适用于近似情况并考虑 decoherence 效应。

Result: 发现纯态重建需要更少资源但仅在接近酉时有效；使用混合态时在有显著去相干时表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法在近似酉时不如纯态重建，在去相干严重时使用混合态重建更优。

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing the unitary describing the
evolution of a quantum system, or quantum channel, from a set of input and
output states. For ideal, fully coherent evolution, we show that the unitary
can be reconstructed from two mixed states or $d+1$ pure states, where $d$ is
the size of Hilbert space. The reconstruction method can be extended to
approximate the unitary part of a dynamical map, provided the decoherence is
not too strong to render this question meaningless. We exemplify the method for
the example of the cross-resonance gate as well as a random set of unitaries,
comparing the reconstruction from pure, respectively mixed, states to an
approach based on the Choi matrix. We find that the pure state reconstruction
requires the least amount of resources when the dynamics is close to unitary,
whereas the mixed state approach outperforms the pure state reconstruction in
terms of channel uses for appreciable decoherence.

*Leon Rullkötter,Sebastian Weber,Vamshi Mohan Katukuri,Christian Tutschku,Bharadwaj Chowdary Mummaneni*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores the compilation of block-encoding quantum circuits by using variational methods. The authors aim to create efficient and near-optimal quantum circuits for quantum algorithms based on Quantum Signal Processing. They investigate how variational parameters in quantum circuits correspond to the free parameters in input matrices, considering factors like matrix symmetry and whether they are real, complex, or Hermitian. By incorporating these symmetries, the number of parameters can be reduced, facilitating optimization for up to 8 qubits. However, the method becomes computationally intensive for larger systems, but the resulting operators can still be used in larger circuits by linear combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum algorithms based on Quantum Signal Processing are becoming increasingly important in quantum computing, and optimizing their gate complexity is crucial. This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently compiling block-encoding unitaries by reducing the number of variational parameters through exploiting symmetries and matrix properties.

Method: The authors propose a variational approach to compile block-encoding unitaries. They design a quantum circuit ansatz that incorporates the symmetries and properties of the input matrices, such as being real, complex, Hermitian, or having certain symmetries. By aligning the number of variational parameters with the free parameters of the input matrices, they aim to optimize the circuit with fewer parameters, making the process more efficient.

Result: The study shows that incorporating symmetries into the variational ansatz reduces the number of required parameters, enabling effective optimization for small to moderate systems (up to 8 qubits). However, for larger systems, the method becomes computationally unfeasible due to the increasing number of parameters. Despite this limitation, the constructed block-encoding operators can serve as building blocks for larger quantum algorithms by combining multiple operators through linear combinations.

Conclusion: This work contributes a method to optimize variational quantum circuits for block-encoding unitaries, leveraging matrix symmetries and properties to reduce the parameter count. While efficient for small systems, further research is needed to address scalability for larger quantum computations.

Abstract: Block-encoding operators are one of the essential components in quantum
algorithms based on Quantum Signal Processing. Their gate complexity largely
determines the overall gate complexity of the full algorithm. Using variational
methods, we aim to compile block-encoding unitaries with near-optimal resource
requirements for a large range of input matrices. We find that the number of
variational parameters in the parameterized quantum circuit approaches the
number of free parameters in the input matrices, depending on whether they are
real, complex and/or hermitian. Additionally, symmetries present in the input
matrix can be incorporated into the ansatz circuit, reducing the parameter
count further and making optimization possible for up to n=8 qubits. While
determining variational block-encodings ceases to be computationally feasible
for large system sizes, the constructed operators can be used as components of
larger block-encodings via a linear combination of block-encodings.

Conclusion: 优化后的微波驱动系统显著提高了氮 vacancy 群体的控制精度和应用价值，特别是在量子计算和高灵敏度检测器方面。

Abstract: Obtaining a high Rabi oscillation frequency homogeneously across a
spatially-extended population of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electronic spins
in diamond is useful for efficient spin-state manipulation of the NV ensemble
and in using NVs to detect ensembles of other spin species. Here, we achieve a
high, homogeneous Rabi frequency for a dense NV ensemble by enhancing the
microwave magnetic fields in the center region of a diamond-coupled planar
metallic loop via systematic engineering that increases the microwave current
driving of the loop, while avoiding off-center proximity to the loop that gives
strong but inhomogeneous microwave fields. With such enhanced microwave fields
at 2.55 GHz, we achieve a 136.3 MHz NV Rabi frequency with 1.5% inhomogeneity
over a 40 $\times$ 40 $\mu m^{2}$ diamond area; and use the NV ensemble to
detect a ~30-MHz magnetic signal, similar to a nuclear magnetic resonance
signal at a tesla-scale bias magnetic field, with Hz-scale spectral resolution.

Motivation: The abstract raises concerns about the practical application of quantum computing, particularly multi-programming, and its implications on security.

quantum hardware. This might lead quantum cloud providers to explore increased
hardware utilization, and thus profitability through means such as
multi-programming, which would allow the execution of multiple programs in

*Seth Lloyd,Lorenzo Maccone,Lionel Martellini,Simone Roncallo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces quantum stroboscopic measurements to overcome Mielnik's Zeno effect argument and successfully obtain time-of-arrival distributions. They do this by using projective measurements at different times and compare it to conventional detectors. Results suggest that stroboscopic methods can provide accurate time measurements without the limitations of the Zeno effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mielnik's Zeno effect argument suggests projective measurements for time of arrival are impossible, challenging conventional quantum measurement theories. Researchers likely wanted to find an alternative method that circumvents this issue and provides accurate time measurements.

Method: The paper proposes quantum stroboscopic measurements, which involve taking projective measurements on different copies of a quantum system at various times. This method accumulates statistics to infer a time-of-arrival distribution, offering a way to measure time without the Zeno effect's constraints.

Result: The study shows that under appropriate limits, quantum stroboscopic measurements yield results comparable to conventional detectors, effectively addressing Mielnik's argument.

Conclusion: This approach, by accumulating projective measurements over time, provides a viable solution for obtaining accurate time measurements without the limitations posed by the Zeno effect, thus offering a new way to perform projective measurements for time of arrival.

Abstract: Mielnik's cannonball argument uses the Zeno effect to argue that projective
measurements for time of arrival are impossible. If one repeatedly measures the
position of a particle (or a cannonball!) that has yet to arrive at a detector,
the Zeno effect will repeatedly collapse its wavefunction away from it: the
particle never arrives. Here we introduce quantum stroboscopic measurements
where we accumulate statistics of projective position measurements, performed
on different copies of the system at different times, to obtain a
time-of-arrival distribution. We show that, under appropriate limits, this
gives the same statistics as time measurements of conventional ``always on''
particle detectors, that bypass Mielnik's argument using non-projective, weak
continuous measurements. In addition to time of arrival, quantum stroboscopy
can describe distributions of general time measurements.

### [120] [Unveiling the Miniband Structure of Graphene Moiré Superlattices via Gate-dependent Terahertz Photocurrent Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16927)

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy as a method for studying electronic properties in graphene moiré superlattices. They demonstrate it can detect avoided band crossings and small energy gaps, which are not visible with other techniques. The technique shows enhanced responses due to lower Fermi velocities and valley degeneracy, leading to zero-bias photocurrents. In the gap, bulk photocurrents are observed related to Berry phase. Moiré superlattices are promising for terahertz applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphene-based materials have shown great potential in various applications, and understanding their electronic properties is crucial. This paper uses advanced spectroscopy techniques to probe the electronic structure of moiré superlattices, which could lead to new insights and applications.

Method: The researchers used terahertz light at different frequencies to detect electronic properties. This method allowed them to observe avoided crossings and energy gaps, which are challenging to see with other methods.

Result: Through their method, they successfully detected small energy gaps (~1-20 meV) and inversion-breaking gaps in graphene and hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures, providing new details about the electronic structure.

Conclusion: This study highlights the effectiveness of terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy for analyzing complex electronic states in 2D materials and suggests its potential for terahertz detection applications in materials science.

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices formed at the interface between stacked two-dimensional
atomic crystals offer limitless opportunities to design materials with widely
tunable properties and engineer intriguing quantum phases of matter. However,
despite progress, precise probing of the electronic states and tantalizingly
complex band textures of these systems remain challenging. Here, we present
gate-dependent terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy as a robust technique to
detect, explore and quantify intricate electronic properties in graphene
moir\'e superlattices. Specifically, using terahertz light at different
frequencies, we demonstrate distinct photocurrent regimes evidencing the
presence of avoided band crossings and tiny (~1-20 meV) inversion-breaking
global and local energy gaps in the miniband structure of minimally twisted
graphene and hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures, key information that is
inaccessible by conventional electrical or optical techniques. In the
off-resonance regime, when the radiation energy is smaller than the gap values,
enhanced zero-bias responsivities arise in the system due to the lower Fermi
velocities and specific valley degeneracies of the charge carriers subjected to
moir\'e superlattice potentials. In stark contrast, above-gap excitations give
rise to bulk photocurrents -- intriguing optoelectronic responses related to
the geometric Berry phase of the constituting electronic minibands. Besides
their fundamental importance, these results place moir\'e superlattices as
promising material platforms for advanced, sensitive and low-noise terahertz
detection applications.

Abstract: We investigate the size-dependent behavior of topological zero modes (TZMs)
in finite non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains implemented on a
topolectrical circuit platform. By deriving exact analytical solutions for the
eigenenergies and band gaps of TZMs, we reveal their sensitivity to system size
and non-Hermitian parameters, such as asymmetric coupling and onsite gain or
loss. Our results show that non-Hermiticity enables the recovery of exactly
zero-energy TZMs at a critical system size, unlike Hermitian systems where
finite-size effects cause energy splitting. These zero-energy modes produce
pronounced impedance peaks in the circuit's admittance spectrum, providing a
measurable signature of topological states. Additionally, a tunable grounding
capacitor enables precise control of TZM energies at a fixed resonance
frequency, enhancing practical tunability. Our findings offer insights into
finite-size effects in non-Hermitian topological systems and guide the design
of robust, reconfigurable topolectrical circuits for sensing and energy
transfer applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在强耦合条件下叠加层产生平凡Z2相和无保护的拓扑边态。通过中等强度的层间耦合和强的非厄米导向放大，在中间层间耦合作用下，基态模式被抑制，而任意的基态激发都会趋向于稳定的环形边状态。利用负反馈机制，无论参数范围如何，系统都保持稳定，甚至在不规则边界上也是如此。这项研究挑战了基于对称性保护的常规观点，为使用反馈增强的非厄米工程设计拓扑设备提供了新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料科学中的拓扑相问题一直是重要研究方向，尤其是量子自旋 hall 故事系统（QSHS）的叠加。研究者们试图在不了解对称性保护的前提下，在中间耦合强度下实现非平凡的拓扑边状态，寻找新的材料或设备设计思路。

Method: 使用了结合中间层间耦合、强非厄米导向放大和负反馈机制的理论模型分析。通过在不同参数范围内进行数值模拟，观察在不同条件下的基态模式行为。观察结果证实系统的稳定性，尤其是在边界面不规则的情况下。

Result: 当系统处于中间层间耦合强度时，基态模式被抑制，导致任意基态激发趋向于稳定的环向边状物态。利用负反馈机制，系统表现出广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 传统的观点认为加上层只能导致平凡系统，不在此处建立非平凡物态。利用反馈机制，非对称性而非对称性保护作为支撑，为 engineer 能设计出新类的拓扑结构提供了可能。这一发现扩展了材料科学中的研究思路，提供了在无对称性保护条件下的新的设计途径。这将有助于开发新的拓扑材料或设备，基于替代的机制来实现边状态。尤其是重要的是，这种机制能够在任意边界条件下保持稳定，这可能促进更灵活的结构设计。这将为物理学和材料科学带来重大进展，特别是对于开发具有新拓扑特性的材料和器件有重要现实意义。这也可能为未来的研究提供新框架与新思路，促使更深入的理论建模和实验验证。这一发现意味着，拓扑属性可能可以通过非对称性或控制参数来调节，而无需依赖材料的天然对称性。这种基于反馈的非对称工程方法，可能为实现更多的拓扑相变提供途径，推动材料科学的发展。这项发现也说明，我们对拓扑物质的多样性认识还有更多方面需要探索，尤其是在打破传统对称性保护的限制下的属性。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that strongly coupling two QSH layers yields a
trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ phase and no protected topological edge states. We
demonstrate that, in a regime with intermediate inter-layer coupling (neither
in the strong or weak coupling regimes) and competitive non-Hermitian directed
amplification, bulk modes are suppressed while arbitrary bulk excitations
inevitably accumulate into robust helical edge transport modes - without
relying on any symmetry protection. Our feedback-enforced mechanism persists
over broad parameter ranges and remains robust even on fractal or irregular
boundaries. These findings challenge the traditional view of stacked QSH
insulators as inevitably trivial, and open up new avenues for designing helical
topological devices that exploit feedback-enforced non-Hermitian engineering,
instead of symmetry-enforced robustness.

Abstract: The quantum states of an electron-hole pair in one-dimensional semiconductors
under a static electric field are theoretically analyzed using a two-band model
with on-site Coulomb interaction. In the absence of static field, the electron
and hole are always bound, forming an exciton regardless of the Coulomb
interaction strength, in contrast to what occurs in higher-dimensional
semiconductors. The static field modifies the wave function of the
electron-hole pair, turning bound states into continuum states. However, at low
static fields, the linear optical spectra resemble those of the unbiased
semiconductor, exhibiting a quadratic redshift of the main exciton absorption
line as the field increases. When the static field exceeds a critical
threshold, the exciton dissociates and the linear optical spectra exhibit
signatures of the Wannier-Stark ladder with squally spaced peaks, making them a
valuable tool for experimentally probing exciton dissociation.

TL;DR: Pressurizing MnBi₂Te₄ induces a transition from a trivial insulator to a Chern insulator, reducing disorder effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study explores how applying pressure to a topological material can affect its electronic properties, specifically transitioning from a trivial insulator to a Chern insulator while modifying disorder impacts.

Method: Hydrostatic pressure is applied to MnBi₂Te₄, and measurements focus on magnetoresistance, band structure, and energy scales.

Result: Under compression, the material transitions from a trivial insulator with disorder to a Chern insulator, with reduced disorder effects supported by changing energy scales.

Conclusion: The research shows that pressure-induced structural changes in MnBi₂Te₄ can lead to a quantum spin Hall state by addressing disorder issues.

Abstract: Topological insulators lacking time-reversal symmetry can exhibit the quantum
anomalous Hall effect. Odd-layer thick MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ is a promising platform
due to its intrinsic magnetic nature, however, quantization is rarely observed
in it. Our magnetoresistance measurements in the anti-ferromagnetic phase
indicate, instead of a quantum anomalous Hall insulator, the presence of a
trivial insulator state likely due to disorder, while at high magnetic field a
Chern insulator state appears. By applying hydrostatic pressure we are able to
tune the magnetic interactions and the characteristic energy scales in the
phase diagram. The trivial band gap is reduced, suggesting the role of disorder
decreases with the compression of the layers.

Ammann-Beenker tilings with magnetic exchange coupling and octagonal warping,
we demonstrate that an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration yields a
topological phase protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry
$\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$. Breaking $\mathcal{S}$ via an in-plane
magnetic field induced canting of the AFM order while preserving a
nonsymmorphic glide symmetry $\mathcal{G}_n=\tau_{1/2}\mathcal{M}_n$ leads to
M\"{o}bius-twisted surface states, realizing a M\"{o}bius insulator in an
aperiodic 3D system. Furthermore, we show that the quasicrystal with a general
magnetic configuration supports multiple HOTI phases characterized by distinct
hinge mode configurations that can be switched by rotating the magnetic field.
A low-energy effective theory reveals that these transitions are driven by mass
kinks between adjacent surfaces. Our work establishes a platform for realizing
symmetry-protected topological phases unique to quasicrystals and highlights
the tunability of hinge and surface states via magnetic control.

Result: 发现磁阻特性表现出磁偶极对称破坏，磁阻在低场下突然消失，并且存在共振峰移位现象。

Conclusion: ultra-high mobility二维电子系统可能作为量子计算的 promising平台。

Abstract: We investigate the striking properties that magnetoresistance of irradiated
two-dimensional electron systems presents when their mobility is ultrahigh and
temperature is low (T =0.5 K). Such as, an abrupt magnetoresistance collapse at
low magnetic field and a resonance peak shift to the second harmonic (2wc = w),
wc and w being the cyclotron and radiation frequencies respectively. We appeal
to the principle of quantum superposition of coherent states and obtain that
Schrodinger cat states (even and odd) are key to explain magnetoresistance at
these extreme mobilities. On the one hand, the Schodinger cat states system
oscillates with 2wc, thus being responsible of the resonance peak shift. On the
other hand, we obtain that Schrodinger cat states-based scattering processes
give rise to a destructive effect when the odd states are involved, leading to
a magnetoresistance collapse. The Aharonov-Bohm effect plays a central role in
the latter, turning even cat states into odd ones. We show that ultra-high
mobility two-dimensional electron systems could make a promising bosonic
mode-based platform for quantum computing.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an energy-efficient hardware accelerator for probabilistic neural networks using magnetic stochasticity, offering significant improvements in figure of merit compared to CMOS implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing reliance on AI in safety-critical applications has raised concerns about the reliability of AI models. Traditional neural networks produce deterministic outputs, making it hard to estimate uncertainty, which is crucial in high-stakes environments. The paper addresses this by exploring probabilistic neural networks and their potential to provide intrinsic uncertainty quantification through randomness, which traditional CMOS architectures struggle to support due to their deterministic nature. This motivates the development of a hardware solution that leverages magnetic properties to enable probabilistic computing.

Method: The paper introduces the Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform, which uses magnetic domain walls and their stochastic properties to create a new paradigm for physical probabilistic computing. The method integrates three mechanisms: thermally induced DW stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR). These mechanisms enable fully electrical and tunable probabilistic functionality at the device level. The approach is implemented in a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validated on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Result: The MPC platform demonstrates significant improvements, achieving seven orders of magnitude better figure of merit compared to standard 28nm CMOS implementations. The results highlight substantial gains in area efficiency, energy consumption, and speed, showing the potential for reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the MPC platform's potential to revolutionize AI by providing energy-efficient, scalable hardware for probabilistic computing, addressing the limitations of traditional CMOS architectures in uncertainty quantification. This opens up new possibilities for trustworthy AI systems in safety-critical applications. Alternatively, this conclusion could be viewed as a call for further exploration into probabilistic computing methods and hardware beyond the MPC platform proposed.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring
reliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks
offer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without
inherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical
domains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have
emerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty
quantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed
for deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This
poses a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic
processing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this
challenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an
energy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic
magnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven
strategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and
their dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing
for AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW
stochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling
magnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic
functionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we
implement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its
functionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS
implementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement
in the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,
energy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's
potential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems.

### [130] [Realizing non-Hermitian tunneling phenomena using non-reciprocal active acoustic metamaterials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17395)
*Felix Langfeldt,Joe Tan,Sayan Jana,Lea Sirota*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes an active acoustic metamaterial made of a waveguide with embedded microphones and loudspeakers to realize wave tunneling through boundaries between reciprocal and non-reciprocal systems, as demonstrated in simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-reciprocal systems and the non-Hermitian skin effect pose challenges for wave transmission, but this work offers a solution through acoustic metamaterials, which is significant for wave management in various applications like phononic crystals or medical devices.

Method: The researchers developed a discrete model of the non-Hermitian lattice, derived a hybrid continuous-discrete model leading to feedback control laws, and used FEM simulations and experiments to validate the tunneling effect.

Result: Simulations and experiments confirmed that the metamaterial successfully enables wave tunneling through the non-reciprocal interface.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new possibilities for controlling wave propagation in non-reciprocal structures, with applications in energy harvesting, sound manipulation, and advanced acoustic devices.

Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems have been shown to exhibit various interesting wave
phenomena, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect, which causes accumulation of
modes at boundaries. Recent research on discrete systems showed that this
effect can pose a barrier for waves hitting an interface between reciprocal and
non-reciprocal systems. Under certain conditions, however, waves can tunnel
through this barrier, similar to the tunneling of particles in quantum
mechanics. This work proposes and investigates an active acoustic metamaterial
design to realize this tunneling phenomenon in the acoustical wave domain. The
metamaterial consists of an acoustic waveguide with microphones and
loudspeakers embedded in its wall. Starting from a purely discrete
non-Hermitian lattice model of the system, a hybrid continuous-discrete
acoustic model is derived, resulting in distributed feedback control laws to
realize the desired behavior for acoustic waves. The proposed control laws are
validated using frequency and time domain finite element method simulations,
which include lumped electro-acoustic loudspeaker models. Additionally, an
experimental demonstration is performed using a waveguide with embedded active
unit cells and a digital implementation of the control laws. In both the
simulations and experiments the tunneling phenomenon is successfully observed.
