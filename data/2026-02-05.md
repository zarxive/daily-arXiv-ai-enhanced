### [1] [Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925)
*Zhi-Qiang Gao,Yan-Qi Wang,Ya-Hui Zhang,Hui Yang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究指出，基于对称群为SU(4)的无oped Mott绝缘体可能是实现零温 primary charge-4e 超导的关键平台，且 Hubbard 模型在适当调制下确实支持这种超导态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超导理论始终是凝聚态物理的核心方向，而突破传统 Cooper 对理论（仅限于电荷-2e）至更高电荷量的超导机理具有重要意义。

Method: 研究者通过构造带有可调 onsite 对称群的双层 Hubbard 模型，并结合群论分析、广义 effective single-site dynamical-mean-field 理论及 DMRG 计算，系统地分析不同对称群下相图及其相性质。

Result: 当 onsite 对称群为 SU(4) 时，研究在零温下观察到 primary charge-4e 超导相；而当对称群为 Sp(4) 时，则退化为传统意义上的 primary charge-2e 超导相。DMRG 计算验证了这些结论。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过选择适当的 Hubbard 模型参数，可以系统地调控不同电荷量的超导相，为探索更复杂及自然存在的超导机制提供了理论平台。

Abstract: Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.

Abstract: Recent experimental studies of the spin-1 honeycomb antiferromagnet Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ have revealed a pronounced one-third magnetization plateau under applied magnetic fields, highlighting the presence of strong magnetic frustration and anisotropy in this material. Such behavior has been attributed to substantial bond-dependent Kitaev interactions in combination with single-ion anisotropy, placing Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ among honeycomb compounds of interest for unconventional magnetic phases. Motivated by these observations, we present a first-principles-based analysis of the magnetic interactions in Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. By combining density-functional calculations with microscopic modeling, we extract the relevant exchange parameters and construct an effective spin model that quantitatively reproduces both the elastic neutron-scattering spectra and the magnetization curve. The model captures the experimentally observed zero-field zigzag magnetic order, and proposes a $\textit{double-zigzag}$ state at intermediate magnetic fields, realizing the 1/3-magnetization plateau in a simpler way than suggested in previous works. Crucially, we show that the one-third magnetization plateau does not require Kitaev interactions; instead, it arises from the interplay of strong out-of-plane single-ion anisotropy and competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor ($J_1$) and antiferromagnetic third-neighbor ($J_3$) Heisenberg couplings. These results establish a consistent microscopic description of Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ and clarify the origin of its field-induced plateau phase.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了Kitaev环面码的一种变形，该变形使系统从拓扑有序相过渡到无序相。通过在圆柱体上建立模型，发现 bulk的全局一形式对称性被分离，成为边界操作符。研究发现，相变伴随着一个更高阶对称性的破坏。通过 (1+1) 维边界哈密顿的量子oescher更要如何使用 holographic 方法，提取了有效中心电荷，并发现在这个临界点周围表现出明显抑制，随后随着强耦合恢复，显示出对 bulk临界性而非拓扑有序的敏感性。

Result: 结果表明，系统的相变伴随着更高阶对称性的破坏。通过 holographic 方法，有效中心电荷显示出在相变点周围明显的抑制，随后随着系统进入强耦合 regime 恢复。这也表明，相变更可能与 bulk 的临界性有关，而非拓扑有序性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入新的维度拆分方法，揭示了 Kitaev 环面码相变的机制。通过边界哈密顿和中心电荷分析，进一步证明了相变与 bulk 临界性相关，而非拓扑有序性。这些发现为研究量子相变机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: This work explores a deformation of the Kitaev toric code that induces a phase transition out of the topologically ordered phase. By placing the model on a cylinder, the bulk global 1-form symmetries separate into distinct boundary operators, allowing us to show that the transition is accompanied by the breaking of one higher-form symmetry. Using a holographic $(1+1)$-dimensional boundary Hamiltonian, we extract an effective central charge and find a pronounced suppression near $β_c$, followed by its restoration at strong coupling, indicating sensitivity to bulk criticality rather than topological order.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The La2-xSrxCuO4+delta (LSCO) system provides a unique experimental setting for exploring how magnetism, superconductivity, and disorder jointly shape charge transport in a doped Mott insulator. Transport measurements in lightly doped and oxygen-enriched LSCO reveal a strongly insulating normal state governed by variable-range hopping, accompanied by pronounced nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, at low temperatures, current-induced negative differential resistance. With increasing carrier concentration, these features evolve into regimes characterized by granular and percolative superconductivity near the threshold of bulk superconductivity and, eventually, into a homogeneous strange-metal state close to optimal doping. Throughout this evolution, the transport response shows marked sensitivity to disorder, electronic inhomogeneity, and external control parameters, such as bias current and magnetic field. Rather than reflecting a sequence of sharply distinct phases, the observed transport regimes form a continuous crossover from a localization-dominated insulating state to granular superconductivity and further to a coherent metallic state. This crossover is driven primarily by the progressive enhancement of electronic screening, inter-region coupling, and superconducting connectivity, rather than by abrupt changes in the underlying microscopic scattering mechanisms. Taken together, the available transport data provide a coherent experimental basis for understanding how disorder and mesoscale electronic inhomogeneity organize charge transport and superconductivity across the LSCO phase diagram, underscoring the central role of percolation and nonequilibrium effects in underdoped cuprates.

### [6] [Detailed, interpretable characterization of mid-circuit measurement on a transmon qubit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03938)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are critical components for utility-scale quantum computing. They can be modeled as quantum instruments, characterized using gate set tomography. However, interpreting these instrumentations is challenging. The authors adapt the error generator formalism to interpret errors in MCMs, decomposing them into physically meaningful elementary errors such as amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. They study how error magnitudes vary with readout pulse amplitude, recover dispersive readout features, and model them with a reduced model using just a few parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of quantum computing is rapidly advancing, and the development of reliable quantum error correction protocols is crucial for achieving practical, large-scale quantum computing. Understanding and accurately characterizing the errors occurring in quantum measurements, such as MCMs, is essential for improving the performance and reliability of quantum devices. This paper addresses a significant gap in the ability to interpret and model the physical mechanisms behind errors in mid-circuit measurements, which is critical for advancing quantum error correction and, ultimately, quantum computing technologies.

Method: The authors use the error generator formalism, previously applied to interpret noisy quantum gates, and adapt it to analyze mid-circuit measurements. They apply this method to data from experiments conducted on a transmon qubit device. Their method involves decomposing the observed errors into elementary components such as amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. They analyze how the magnitudes of these errors vary with the amplitude of the readout pulse. The authors also employ theoretical predictions about dispersive readout to interpret their experimental results. Finally, they simplify their model to use a minimal set of parameters that effectively capture the essential features of the errors observed.

Result: The authors successfully model and quantify the error mechanisms in mid-circuit measurements, identifying amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse as significant sources of error. They demonstrate that the magnitude of these errors varies with the amplitude of the readout pulse. The experimental results align well with theoretical predictions about dispersive readout. The authors further simplify their model to a reduced form that captures the essential features of the errors with just a few parameters. This work provides a clearer understanding of error mechanisms in MCMs and offers a practical framework for characterizing and mitigating errors in quantum computing hardware.

Conclusion: This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of quantum error characterization by extending the error generator formalism to mid-circuit measurements. The authors demonstrate that their approach can effectively decompose and quantify the physical mechanisms underlying errors in MCMs. By validating their model against both experimental data and theoretical predictions, they provide a robust framework for analyzing and improving the reliability of mid-circuit measurements in quantum computing devices. This work is a crucial step toward enabling practical fault-tolerant quantum computing by advancing our ability to characterize and address errors in quantum hardware.

Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) are critical components of the quantum error correction protocols expected to enable utility-scale quantum computing. MCMs can be modeled by quantum instruments (a type of quantum operation or process), which can be characterized self-consistently using gate set tomography. However, experimentally estimated quantum instruments are often hard to interpret or relate to device physics. We address this challenge by adapting the error generator formalism -- previously used to interpret noisy quantum gates by decomposing their error processes into physically meaningful sums of "elementary errors" -- to MCMs. We deploy our new analysis on a transmon qubit device to tease out and quantify error mechanisms including amplitude damping, readout error, and imperfect collapse. We examine in detail how the magnitudes of these errors vary with the readout pulse amplitude, recover the key features of dispersive readout predicted by theory, and show that these features can be modeled parsimoniously using a reduced model with just a few parameters.

Motivation: The study of quantum circuit simulation on classical computers is crucial for establishing the boundaries of verifiable quantum advantage, addressing complex quantum many-body problems, and informing the development of quantum hardware and software. Additionally, the use of tensor networks presents an exciting mathematical toolset for these tasks.

Method: The authors introduce a method that employs sparsely-populated tensors to simulate quantum circuits. They describe a novel sparse tensor data structure designed to represent quantum states without relying on underlying symmetries. Furthermore, they outline efficient tensor contraction and truncation algorithms to handle these tensors.

Result: The findings indicate that the proposed sparse tensor data structure and contraction algorithms are efficient, with expected runtime scalings that depend on the number of qubits and circuit depth.

Conclusion: These results suggest promising directions for future research in optimizing sparse tensor networks for quantum simulation applications.

Abstract: The study of quantum circuit simulation using classical computers is a key research topic that helps define the boundary of verifiable quantum advantage, solve quantum many-body problems, and inform development of quantum hardware and software. Tensor networks have become forefront mathematical tools for these tasks. Here we introduce a method to approximately simulate quantum circuits using sparsely-populated tensors. We describe a sparse tensor data structure that can represent quantum states with no underlying symmetry, and outline algorithms to efficiently contract and truncate these tensors. We show that the data structure and contraction algorithm are efficient, leading to expected runtime scalings versus qubit number and circuit depth. Our results motivate future research in optimization of sparse tensor networks for quantum simulation.

### [8] [Correlation-Enabled Beatings in Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04061)
*Sirui Chen,Dragomir Davidović*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Long-lived beatings in 2DES are hard to interpret using traditional models, but we found they can result from a correlation-driven mechanism involving slow bath memory and fast pulses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and interpreting long-lived beatings in 2DES could provide insights into complex quantum systems and improve modeling techniques.

Method: The research explored a correlation-driven mechanism by analyzing ultrafast pulse sequences and their effect on system-bath interactions.

Result: We demonstrated that long-lived beatings can emerge due to slow bath memory and ultrafast pulses, challenging conventional excitation-based models.

Conclusion: This suggests that correlation effects can sustain coherence signatures beyond traditional models, offering a new framework for interpreting complex quantum behavior in 2DES.

Abstract: Long-lived beatings in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) remain difficult to interpret within standard excitonic open-system models, which typically assume factorized initialization and predict rapid coherence decay. We show that persistent beatings can arise from a correlation-driven mechanism that requires both slow bath memory and ultrafast pulse sequences that propagate system-bath correlations across optical interactions. In this regime, the pulse sequence unitarily dresses the bath-memory contribution and activates nonsecular population-coherence transfer during field-free evolution, sustaining coherence signatures far beyond factorized or weak-memory descriptions. Rather than addressing what is oscillating (excitonic versus vibronic) or quantum-versus-classical semantics, this work reframes long-lived beatings as a protocol-level dynamical effect: correlation-mediated retrieval under ultrafast control.

Abstract: Motivated by a recently developed generalized scheme of quantum mechanics, we touch upon connections with Levinson-Smith classes of nonlinear systems that contain as a particular case the Liénard family of differential equations. The latter, which has coefficients of odd and odd symmetry, admits a closed form solution when converted to the Abel form. Analysis of the governing condition shows that one of the nontrivial equilibrium points is stable in character. Other classes of differential equations that we encounter speak of solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions for a certain combination of underlying parameters, while, for a different set, relevance to position-dependent mass systems is shown. In addition, an interesting off-shoot of our results is the emergence of solitonic-like solutions from the condition of the level surface in the system.

Abstract: Quantum program generation demands a level of precision that may not be compatible with the statistical reasoning carried out in the inference of large language models (LLMs). Hallucinations are mathematically inevitable and not addressable by scaling, which leads to infeasible solutions. We argue that architectures prioritizing verification are necessary for quantum copilots and AI automation in domains governed by constraints. Our position rests on three key points: verified training data enables models to internalize precise constraints as learned structures rather than statistical approximations; verification must constrain generation rather than filter outputs, as valid designs occupy exponentially shrinking subspaces; and domains where physical laws impose correctness criteria require verification embedded as architectural primitives. Early experiments showed LLMs without data verification could only achieve a maximum accuracy of 79% in circuit optimization. Our positions are formulated as quantum computing and AI4Research community imperatives, calling for elevating verification from afterthought to architectural foundation in AI4Research.

Abstract: Traditional Bell state measurement (BSM) and product basis measurements (PBM) have been integral to nearly the entire development of quantum computing. Unlike the BSM and the PBM, a recently proposed two-qubit joint measurement called the elegant joint measurement (EJM) exhibits novel tetrahedral symmetry in its single-qubit reduced states. In [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401], a parameterized two-qubit iso-entangled basis was proposed, with concurrence between 1/2 and 1, perfectly spanning the original EJM and conventional BSM. We present a two-qubit symmetric joint measurement having concurrence from 0 to 1/2, which is complementary to [Phys.Rev.Lett.126:220401] and contains the PBM and the original EJM. We investigate the symmetry of the current structure and its application in triangular networks. The results indicate that the reduction vectors of the current basis states exhibit rotational symmetry, rather than the aforementioned mirror symmetry; moreover, the output probability distributions of three parties in the network explicitly demonstrate the expected permutation symmetry. Furthermore, we generalize the two-qubit symmetric joint measurement to the multiqubit systems with an even number of qubits.

Abstract: The effect of noninertial dynamics on static quantum resource theories is investigated. To this end, we first show the equivalence between noninertial effects and a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map. In this formulation, the Unruh effect is equivalent to a bosonic amplifier channel. The effect of this map on a generic quantum resource is investigated by studying the role of the CPTP map on the three core ingredients of a resource theory, namely, the free states, the free operations and the resource quantifiers. We show several general statements can be made about these three components of a resource theory in the presence of noninertial motion.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study compares QTN, HSE, and PINN methods for solving 1D Burgers' equation, showing QTN's superior precision and runtime scaling, while HSE is unstable at high resolutions and PINN lacks accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating these methods can improve fluid dynamics simulations by leveraging quantum computing and machine learning.

Method: The study evaluates QTN, HSE, and PINN against classical GMRES and Spectral methods, analyzing accuracy, runtime, and resource usage across various grid resolutions.

Result: QTN achieves high precision with stable runtime, HSE is unreliable at high resolutions, and PINN struggles with accuracy.

Conclusion: Currently, classical methods outperform quantum and neural network approaches for fluid dynamics simulations without advanced error correction.

Abstract: We present a comparative benchmark of Quantum Tensor Networks (QTN), the Hydrodynamic Schrödinger Equation (HSE), and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) for simulating the 1D Burgers' equation. Evaluating these emerging paradigms against classical GMRES and Spectral baselines, we analyse solution accuracy, runtime scaling, and resource overhead across grid resolutions ranging from $N=4$ to $N=128$. Our results reveal a distinct performance hierarchy. The QTN solver achieves superior precision ($L_2 \sim 10^{-7}$) with remarkable near-constant runtime scaling, effectively leveraging entanglement compression to capture shock fronts. In contrast, while the Finite-Difference HSE implementation remains robust, the Spectral HSE method suffers catastrophic numerical instability at high resolutions, diverging significantly at $N=128$. PINNs demonstrate flexibility as mesh-free solvers but stall at lower accuracy tiers ($L_2 \sim 10^{-1}$), limited by spectral bias compared to grid-based methods. Ultimately, while quantum methods offer novel representational advantages for low-resolution fluid dynamics, this study confirms they currently yield no computational advantage over classical solvers without fault tolerance or significant algorithmic breakthroughs in handling non-linear feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the efficiency and scalability of quantum eigensolvers for molecular ground state energy calculation is crucial for advancing quantum chemistry simulations.

Method: Param-ADAPT-VQE introduces a parameter-based criterion for selecting excitation operators, eliminating redundant ones, and integrates a sub-Hamiltonian technique with a hot-start VQE optimization strategy to reduce measurement costs.

Result: Numerical experiments show that Param-ADAPT-VQE outperforms ADAPT-VQE in computational accuracy, ansatz size, and measurement costs for typical molecular systems.

Conclusion: Param-ADAPT-VQE effectively addresses the main limitations of ADAPT-VQE, enabling practical enhancements for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in molecular quantum chemistry.

Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-trotter variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is a promising hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for molecular ground state energy calculation, yet its practical scalability is hampered by redundant excitation operators and excessive measurement costs. To address these challenges, we propose Param-ADAPT-VQE, a novel improved algorithm that selects excitation operators based on a parameter-based criterion instead of the traditional gradient-based metric. This strategy effectively eludes redundant operators. We further develop a sub-Hamiltonian technique and integrate a hot-start VQE optimization strategy, achieving a significant reduction in measurement costs. Numerical experiments on typical molecular systems demonstrate that Param-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the original ADAPT-VQE in computational accuracy, ansatz size, and measurement costs. Furthermore, our scheme retains the fundamental framework of ADAPT-VQE and is thus fully compatible with its various modified versions, enabling further performance improvements in specific aspects. This work presents an efficient and scalable enhancement to ADAPT-VQE, mitigating the core obstacles that impede its practical implementation in the field of molecular quantum chemistry.

Abstract: We investigate the dissipative dynamics of a two-level atom in a weak gravitational field. Using the Feynman--Vernon influence functional formalism, we derive a quantum master equation describing the two-level atom interacting with a scalar field in a Newtonian gravitational field, and compute the energy dissipation rate of the atom. We find that the spontaneous emission rate (the dissipation rate in vacuum) is modified by the gravitational field. Specifically, this modification depends on the atom's dipole, the position of the atom relative to the source of the gravitational field, and the frequency of the scalar radiation emitted by the atom. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regimes in which the spontaneous emission rate is enhanced or suppressed by gravity. We also discuss how the modification arises from time dilation and dipole radiation in a weak gravitational field. These findings provide a theoretical basis for exploring gravitational effects in open quantum systems.

Abstract: We present a canonical quantization of electromagnetic modes in cylindrical waveguides, extending a gauge-based formalism previously developed for Cartesian geometries [1]. By introducing the two field quadratures $X,Y$ of TEM (transverse electric-magnetic), but also of TM (transverse magnetic) and TE (transverse electric) traveling modes, we identify for each a characteristic one-dimensional scalar field (a generalized flux $\varphi$) governed by a Klein-Gordon type equation. The associated Hamiltonian is derived explicitly from Maxwell's equations, allowing the construction of bosonic ladder operators. The generalized flux is directly deduced from the electromagnetic potentials $A,V$ by a proper gauge choice, generalizing Devoret's approach [2]. Our analysis unifies the treatment of cylindrical and Cartesian guided modes under a consistent and generic framework, ensuring both theoretical insight and experimental relevance. We derive mode-specific capacitance and inductance from the field profiles and express voltage and current in terms of the canonical field variables. Measurable quantities are therefore properly defined from the mode quantum operators, especially for the non-trivial TM and TE ones. The formalism shall extend in future works to any other type of waveguides, especially on-chip coplanar geometries particularly relevant to quantum technologies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It is known that when a system interacts with its environment, the entanglement contained in the system is redistributed since parts of the system entangle with the environment. On the other hand, the entanglement of a system with its environment is closely related to the entropy of the system. However, does this imply that the entropy of systems with larger internal entanglement will grow stronger? We study the issue using the simplest model as an example: a system of qubits interacts with the environment described by the quantum harmonic oscillator. The answer to the posed question is ambiguous. However, the study of the situation on average (using the simulation of a set of random states) reveals certain patterns and we can say that the answer is affirmative. At the same time, the choice of states satisfying certain conditions in some cases can change the dependence to the opposite. Additionally, we show that the entanglement depth also makes a small contribution to entropy growth.

Abstract: Achieving ubiquitous global connectivity requires integrating satellite and terrestrial networks, particularly to serve remote and underserved regions. In this work, we investigate the design and optimization of Space-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs) using a hybrid quantum-classical approach. We formalize three key combinatorial optimization problems: the Satellite Selection Problem (SSP), the Gateway Selection Problem (GSP), and the Spectrum Assignment Problem (SAP), each capturing critical aspects of network deployment and operation. Leveraging neutral-atom quantum processors, we map the SSP onto a Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, embedding it onto the Aquila platform and solving it via the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm (QAA). Postprocessing ensures feasible solutions that guide downstream GSP and SAP optimization. Benchmarking across 165 realistic remote regions shows that QAA solutions closely match classical exact solvers and outperform greedy heuristics, while subsequent GSP and SAP outcomes remain largely robust to differences in initial satellite selection. These results demonstrate that quantum optimization achieves performance broadly comparable to classical approaches for end-to-end STIN design, with rare instances where it can even surpass state-of-the-art solvers. This suggests that, while not yet consistently superior, quantum methods may offer competitive advantages for larger or more complex instances of the underlying combinatorial subproblems.

Abstract: Dicke superradiance is a collective phenomenon where the emission from ensembles of quantum emitters is coherently enhanced beyond the sum of each emitter's independent emission. Here, we propose a platform that exploits the delocalised nature of a high-Q, non-local mode supported by a dielectric metasurface (a so-called bound-state-in-the-continuum or BIC) to induce superradiant behaviour within an extended two-dimensional array of distant quantum emitters. We show that these BIC-mediated emitter interactions can span several wavelengths, thus overcoming the traditional subwavelength separation between emitters required in free space. We further show that reaching the idealised Dicke limit is possible in this system, provided that the emitters are coupled to the BIC mode efficiently enough, as quantified through the $β$-factor. Moreover, we demonstrate its experimental viability by analysing its robustness to realistic experimental imperfections. This work puts forward optical metasurfaces supporting BICs as a physically viable platform for realising the upper limits of cooperative emission in physically extended quantum emitter arrays.

Abstract: Landauer's principle, a cornerstone of quantum information and thermodynamics, appears to be violated when the thermal reservoir is replaced by a squeezed thermal state (STS). We introduce a formal extension of the principle to such unitarily transformed thermal states. By defining an effective Hamiltonian, we rigorously establish a generalized Landauer inequality, which naturally reduces to the standard case for an ordinary thermal reservoir as a special instance. The framework further yields a consistent definition of entropy production and a proof of its non-negativity. We illustrate its utility by studying an arbitrarily moving Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a quantum field initially prepared in the STS. Using perturbation theory, we compute the entropy production explicitly, confirming its positivity. As a result of the symmetry breaking induced by the unitary transformation, it depends on both the proper time interval and the absolute spacetime position. Our work resolves the apparent violation of Landauer's principle with STSs. It also provides a robust tool for analyzing quantum thermodynamics in non-equilibrium and relativistic settings, with potential implications for quantum thermal machines and information protocols.

Abstract: Kolmogorov's foundation of probability takes measure spaces, $σ$-algebras, and probability measures as basic objects. It is, however, widely recognized that this classical framework is inadequate for random phenomena involving quantum effects, and more generally for \emph{quantum-like} situations. A broader formulation is provided by an algebraic viewpoint: one starts from an algebra of random variables equipped with a distinguished linear functional -- the \emph{state} -- interpreted as expectation. In this sense, the approach can also be viewed as a modern reading of ideas already implicit in early probability (e.g., the Bernoullis), while its contemporary form has been developed and used extensively in quantum physics.
  The algebraic framework accommodates both classical and quantum-like behaviours, yet it remains underused in classical probability and uncertainty quantification, where it can nevertheless open new perspectives and clarify structural features. Although the language carries a physics flavor, the subject is purely probabilistic. The key distinction between classical and quantum-like behaviour is \emph{commutativity}: its failure produces the characteristic effects of quantum-like situations. The rise of quantum computing is a prominent setting in which such behaviour may become relevant even for practitioners in computational science. Here we focus on the purely algebraic core of the approach. By restricting attention to finite-dimensional algebras, we avoid many analytical subtleties while retaining the main ideas, their classical limit, and their applicability to quantum-like models and quantum computation.

Abstract: Entanglement is a central resource in quantum information and quantum technologies, yet its characterization remains challenging due to both theoretical complexity and measurement requirements. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling entanglement characterization from incomplete measurement data, however model interpretability remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a unified and interpretable framework for SLOCC entanglement classification of two- and three-qubit states, encompassing both pure and mixed states. We train dense and convolutional neural networks on Pauli-measurement outcomes, provide design guidelines for each architecture, and systematically compare their performance across types of states. To interpret the models, we compute Shapley values to quantify the contribution of each measurement, analyze measurement-importance patterns across different systems, and use these insights to guide a measurement-reduction scheme. Accuracy-versus-measurement curves and comparisons with analytical entanglement criteria demonstrate the minimal resources required for reliable classification and highlight both the capabilities and limitations of Shapley-based interpretability when using machine learning models for entanglement detection and classification.

*Rasmus Vesterager Gothelf,Lars Bojer Madsen,Christian Saugbjerg Lange*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses the accuracy of an approximative phase-space description in modeling nonclassical light effects and their impact on quantum optical observables, finding that the approach mischaracterizes observables like squeezing and photon statistics but can be validated using exact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to assess the limitations of an approximated phase-space method in describing quantum optical properties, particularly in the context of high-order harmonic generation and nonclassical light effects.

Method: The methodology involves introducing an approximate phase-space description of nonclassical laser fields, analyzing its accuracy against quantum optical observables, and comparing numerical results with exact analytical solutions from a one-band model of quantum harmonic generation.

Result: The study reveals that the approximative phase-space approach inaccurately models quantum optical properties such as photon statistics and quadrature squeezing. However, discrepancies in photon statistics disappear when examining the emitted field's quadrature variance, which shows a small, calculable error dependent on pulse duration and emitter density.

Conclusion: The research concludes that while the approximative phase-space description introduces errors in directly modeling quantum optical observables, it may still be useful for practical applications where quantitative error analysis is conducted.

Abstract: In recent years, strong-field processes such as high-order harmonic generation (HHG) and above-threshold ionization driven by nonclassical states of light have become an increasingly popular field of study. The theoretical modeling of these processes often applies an approximate phase-space expansion of the nonclassical driving field in terms of coherent states, which has been shown to accurately predict the harmonic spectrum. However, its accuracy for the computation of quantum optical observables like the degree of squeezing and photon statistics has not been thoroughly considered. In this work, we introduce this approximative phase-space description and discuss its accuracy, and we find that it mischaracterizes the quantum optical properties of the driving laser by making it an incoherent mixture of classical states. We further show that this error in the driving field description maps onto the light emitted from HHG, as neither sub-Poissonian photon statistics nor quadrature squeezing below vacuum fluctuations can be captured by the approximative phase-space description. Lastly, to benchmark the approximative phase-space description, we consider the quantum HHG from a one-band model, which yields an exact analytical solution. Using the approximative phase-space representation with this specific model, we find a small quantitative error in the quadrature variance of the emitted field that scales with pulse duration and emitter density. Our results show that using this approximative phase-space description can mischaracterize quantum optical observables. Attributing physical meaning to such results should therefore be accompanied by a quantitative analysis of the error.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a squeezing-enhanced Sagnac interferometer that surpasses the SNL in rotational sensing through SU(1,1) interference. The OPA placement inside the Sagnac loop enables light squeezing in both directions, enhancing phase detection. Two detection approaches are explored: direct detection and parametric homodyne detection. Analysis shows super-classical sensitivity under realistic conditions, offering a practical solution compatible with Sagnac configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotational sensing using interferometers aims for high sensitivity, and this paper addresses surpassing the classical SNL limit through innovative use of squeezing and SU(1,1) interference.

Method: Suggests building a Sagnac interferometer with an OPA inside the loop to enable squeezing. Detects the squeezed quadrature using either direct intensity detection or parametric homodyne detection.

Result: The method achieves super-classical sensitivity even with losses and detector inefficiency, demonstrating practicality and compatibility with standard Sagnac setups.

Conclusion: The proposed squeezing-enhanced Sagnac interferometer effectively surpasses the SNL, offering an improved solution for rotational sensing with practical benefits.

Abstract: We present a simple and robust design for a squeezing-enhanced Sagnac interferometer that employs the concept of SU(1,1) interference to significantly surpass the classical sensitivity limit (shot-noise limit - SNL) in rotational sensing. By strategically placing an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) inside the Sagnac loop, light is automatically squeezed in both forward and backward directions of the loop, which enhances the detectability of a small phase. For measuring the squeezed quadrature, we explore two approaches: Direct detection of the output intensity, which is simple, but requires a high-efficiency photo-detector; and parametric homodyne with an additional OPA, which accepts practical detectors with no efficiency limitation, but is technically more complex. Our analysis demonstrates super-classical sensitivity under most realistic conditions of loss and detector inefficiency, thereby leveraging the resources of squeezing and the principles of SU(1,1) interference, while maintaining compatibility with standard Sagnac configurations.

Abstract: We study finite-length qudit quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from translation-invariant CSS constructions on two-dimensional tori with twisted boundary conditions. Recent qubit work [PRX Quantum 6, 020357 (2025)] showed that, within the bivariate-bicycle viewpoint, twisting generalized toric patterns can significantly improve finite-size performance as measured by $k d^{2}/n$. Here $n$ denotes the number of physical qudits, $k$ the number of logical qudits, and $d$ the code distance. Building on this insight, we extend the search to qudit codes over finite fields. Using algebraic methods, we compute the number of logical qudits and identify compact codes with favorable rate--distance tradeoffs. Overall, for the finite sizes explored, twisted-torus qudit constructions typically achieve larger distances than their untwisted counterparts and outperform previously reported twisted qubit instances. The best new codes are tabulated.

Abstract: The realization of high-fidelity quantum control is crucial for quantum information processing, particularly in noisy environments where control strategies must simultaneously achieve precise manipulation and effective noise suppression. Conventional optimal control designs typically requires numerical calculations of the system dynamics. Recent studies have demonstrated that long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM-NNs) can accurately predict the time evolution of open quantum systems. Based on LSTM-NN predicted dynamics, we propose an optimal control framework for rapid and efficient optimal control design in open quantum systems. As an exemplary example, we apply our scheme to design an optimal control for the adiabatic speedup in a two-level system under a non-Markovian environment. Our optimization procedure entails two steps: driving trajectory optimization and zero-area pulse optimization. Fidelity improvement for both steps have been obtained, showing the effectiveness of the scheme. Our optimal control design scheme utilizes predicted dynamics to generate optimized controls, offering broad application potential in quantum computing, communication, and sensing.

Abstract: A rotating surface can induce a frequency shift in incident light by changing its angular momentum, a phenomenon known as the rotational Doppler effect. This effect provides a means to estimate the angular velocity of the rotating surface. In this work, we develop a continuous-variable quantum protocol for estimating the angular velocity of a rotating surface via the rotational Doppler effect. Our approach exploits squeezed and displaced Laguerre-Gaussian modes as quantum resources, which interact with a rotating metallic disc with surface roughness. The frequency shift induced by the rotational Doppler effect is then measured using a homodyne detection scheme. By analyzing the Fisher information, we demonstrate that the proposed squeezing-enhanced protocol achieves Heisenberg scaling in the ideal noiseless regime. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of noise and consider different surface models to assess their impact on the protocol's performance. While Heisenberg scaling is degraded in the presence of noise, we show that optimizing the energy allocation ratio between displacement and squeezing of the probe ensures that the quantum strategy consistently outperforms its classical counterpart.

Abstract: A type of mechanics will be presented that possesses some distinctive properties. On the one hand, its physical description & rules of operation are readily comprehensible & intuitively clear. On the other, it fully satisfies all observable predictions of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Within it, particles exist at points in space, follow continuous, piecewise differentiable paths, and their linear momentum is equal to their mass times their velocity along their path. Yet the probabilities for position and momentum, conditioned on the state of the particle's environment, follow the rules of quantum theory. Indeed, all observable consequences of quantum theory are satisfied; particles can be entangled, have intrinsic spin, this spin is not local to the particle, particle identity can effect probabilities, and so forth. All the rules of quantum mechanics are obeyed, and all arise in a straightforward fashion. After this is established, connections will be drawn out between this type of mechanics and other types of quantum worlds; those that obey Bohmian mechanics, stochastic mechanics, the many worlds interpretation, and physical collapse. In the final section, a relativistic version of the mechanics will be presented.

TL;DR: The paper examines the thermodynamic cost of regeneration in a quantum Stirling heat engine and finds that including the regeneration cost prohibits super-Carnot efficiency, while still allowing for higher efficiency than the conventional Stirling cycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the thermodynamic principles underlying quantum heat engines is crucial for advancing quantum thermodynamics and engine optimization.

Method: The authors use a quantum thermodynamics framework, analyzing both single and two-spin systems under weak-coupling assumptions and considering Carnot limits for regeneration cost.

Result: Regeneration introduces a thermodynamic cost, reducing efficiency below the conventional Stirling cycle.

Conclusion: Quantum regenerative cycles face inherent efficiency limitations that require further engineering exploration.

Abstract: We study the regenerative quantum Stirling heat engine cycle within the standard weak-coupling, Markovian open quantum system framework. We point out that the regeneration process is not thermodynamically free in a reduced open-system description, and we treat the required work input as an explicit regeneration cost by modifying the cycle efficiency accordingly. We consider two working substances--a single spin-$1/2$ and a pair of interacting spin-$1/2$ particles--and investigate the cycle performance by taking the regeneration cost at its minimum value set by the Carnot heat-pump limit. For comparison, we also analyze the conventional Stirling cycle without regeneration under the same conditions. The super-Carnot efficiencies reported under the cost-free regeneration assumption disappear once the regeneration cost is included: the modified efficiency stays below the Carnot bound, while still remaining higher than the efficiency of the conventional Stirling cycle. For the conventional Stirling cycle, we provide a rigorous Carnot bound using quantum relative entropy, whereas for the regenerative cycle we derive a sufficient lower bound on the regeneration cost that guarantees thermodynamic consistency. Finally, we suggest three candidate quantum regenerator models for future work.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate how initial intrasystem entanglement influences the entropy generated in atomic systems interacting with a photonic environment in several generalizations of the Jaynes-Cummings model with two or more subsystems. Since the initial entanglement does not uniquely determine the final entropy, we focus on ensemble-averaged behavior. We consider ensembles of initial system states including pure and mixed Haar-random states, ensembles with fixed average energy or fixed mixedness, and varying initial photon numbers in the environment. In all cases, we observe a positive correlation between the initial entanglement and the entropy growth, although the fractional contribution of the initial entanglement varies. Our results emphasize the role of intrasystem correlations as a factor contributing to entropy growth in quantum informational processes.

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解量子测量的局限性以及如何在保护量子态的情况下高效提取信息提供了新的视角。它表明，减少对量子态的破坏可能需要更多的样本，尤其是当量子态的维度较高时。这对于开发更高效的量子学习算法和隐私保护机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: Standard approaches to quantum statistical inference rely on measurements that induce a collapse of the wave function, effectively consuming the quantum state to extract information. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of \emph{locally-gentle} quantum state certification, where the learning algorithm is constrained to perturb the state by at most $α$ in trace norm, thereby allowing for the reuse of samples. We analyze the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing whether an unknown state $ρ$ is equal to a reference $ρ_0$ or $ε$-far from it. We derive the minimax sample complexity for this problem, quantifying the information-theoretic price of non-destructive measurements. Specifically, by constructing explicit measurement operators, we show that the constraint of $α$-gentleness imposes a sample size penalty of $\frac{d}{α^2}$, yielding a total sample complexity of $n = Θ(\frac{d^3}{ε^2 α^2})$. Our results clarify the trade-off between information extraction and state disturbance, and highlight deep connections between physical measurement constraints and privacy mechanisms in quantum learning. Crucially, we find that the sample size penalty incurred by enforcing $α$-gentleness scales linearly with the Hilbert-space dimension $d$ rather than the number of parameters $d^2-1$ typical for high-dimensional private estimation.

Conclusion: 该研究拓展了量子纠缠在网络协同场景中的应用领域，为分布式系统优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Coordination in distributed systems is often hampered by communication latency, which degrades performance. Quantum entanglement offers fundamentally stronger correlations than classically achievable without communication. Crucially, these correlations manifest instantaneously upon measurement, irrespective of the physical distance separating the systems. We investigate the application of shared entanglement to a dual-work optimization problem in a distributed system comprising two servers. The system must process both a continuously available, preemptible baseline task and incoming customer requests arriving in pairs. System performance is characterized by the trade-off between baseline task throughput and customer waiting time. We present a rigorous analytical model demonstrating that when the baseline task throughput function is strictly convex, rewarding longer uninterrupted processing periods, entanglement-assisted routing strategies achieve Pareto-superior performance compared to optimal communication-free classical strategies. We prove this advantage through queueing-theoretic analysis, non-local game formulation, and computational certification of classical bounds. Our results identify distributed scheduling and coordination as a novel application domain for near-term entanglement-based quantum networks.

Abstract: We examine the logical structure of the emergence of classical stochasticity for a quantum system governed by a Pauli-type master equation. It is well-known that while such equations describe the evolution of probabilities, they do not automatically justify classical reasoning based on the assumption that the system exists in a definite state at intermediate times. On the other hand, we show that this assumption is crucial for the standard calculation of stochastic times such as the persistent time and the time of first arrivals. We then consider examples of single particles, bosons, and fermions in the so-called ultradecoherence limit to illustrate how classical stochasticity may emerge from quantum mechanics.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are practical approaches to prepare ground states, but their potential for quantum advantage remains unclear. Here, we use differentiable 2D tensor networks (TN) to optimize parameterized quantum circuits that prepare the ground state of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our method enables the preparation of states with high energy accuracy, even for large systems beyond 1D. We show that TN pre-optimization can mitigate the barren plateau issue by giving access to enhanced gradient zones that do not shrink exponentially with system size. We evaluate the classical simulation cost evaluating energies at these warm-starts, and identify regimes where quantum hardware offers better scaling than TN simulations.

Abstract: The analysis of the computational power of single-query quantum algorithms is important because they must extract maximal information from one oracle call, revealing fundamental limits of quantum advantage and enabling optimal, resource-efficient quantum computation. This paper proposes a formulation of single-query quantum decision trees as weighted graphs. This formulation has the advantage that it facilitates the analysis of the $L_1$ spectral norm of the algorithm output. This advantage is based on the fact that a high $L_1$ spectral norm of the output of a quantum decision tree is a necessary condition to outperform its classical counterpart. We propose heuristics for maximizing the $L_{1}$ spectral norm, show how to combine weighted graphs to generate sequences with strictly increasing norm, and present functions exhibiting exponential quantum advantage. Finally, we establish a necessary condition linking single-query quantum advantage to the asymptotic growth of measurement projector dimensions.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to revolutionize several scientific and technological domains through fundamentally new ways of processing information. Among its most compelling applications is digital quantum simulation, where quantum computers are used to replicate the behavior of other quantum systems. This could enable the study of problems that are otherwise intractable on classical computers, transforming fields such as quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. Despite this potential, realizations of practical quantum advantage for relevant problems are hindered by imperfections of current devices. This also affects quantum hardware based on superconducting circuits which is among the most advanced and scalable platforms. The envisaged long-term solution of fault-tolerant quantum computers that correct their own errors remains out of reach mainly due to the associated qubit number overhead. As a result, the field has developed strategies that combine quantum and classical resources, exploit hardware-native operations, and employ error mitigation techniques to extract meaningful results from noisy data. This doctoral thesis contributes to this broader effort by exploring methods for advancing quantum simulation across the full computational stack, including hardware-level innovations, refined techniques for noise modeling and error mitigation, and algorithmic improvements enabled by efficient measurement processing.

Motivation: Understanding energy transport mechanisms in dense spin systems is crucial for developing advanced materials with tailored electronic properties.

Method: Theoretical analysis combined with experimental observation of spin transport dynamics in solid-state systems.

Result: Diagonal Ising interactions are identified as the primary mechanism driving energy transport bottlenecks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of non-perturbative diagonal interactions in collective relaxation processes, offering a new perspective on energy transport in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: The recent observation of self-induced superradiant masing [[W. Kersten et al., Nat. Phys. 22, 158 (2026)]] revealed a collective relaxation timescale significantly slower than predicted by standard coherent transport models. Here, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this ``relaxation bottleneck.'' We show that in the high-density regime relevant to the experiment, diagonal Ising interactions -- often treated as perturbative -- generate profound inhomogeneous broadening that exceeds the intrinsic single-particle dephasing. This intense diagonal disorder suppresses resonant flip-flop exchange, effectively renormalizing the density of states available for spectral diffusion. Our parameter-free analytic theory quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed microsecond dynamics, identifying Ising-induced broadening as the governing mechanism for energy transport in dense solid-state spin ensembles.

Abstract: Digitized adiabatic quantum factorization is a hybrid algorithm that exploits the advantage of digitized quantum computers to implement efficient adiabatic algorithms for factorization through gate decompositions of analog evolutions. In this paper, we harness the flexibility of digitized computers to derive a digitized adiabatic algorithm able to reduce the gate-demanding costs of implementing factorization. To this end, we propose a new approach for adiabatic factorization by encoding the solution of the problem in the kernel subspace of the problem Hamiltonian, instead of using ground-state encoding considered in the standard adiabatic factorization proposed by Peng $et$ $al$. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 220405 (2008)]. Our encoding enables the design of adiabatic factorization algorithms belonging to the class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) methods, instead the Polinomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO) used by standard adiabatic factorization. We illustrate the performance of our QUBO algorithm by implementing the factorization of integers $N$ up to 8 bits. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement over the PUBO formulation, both in terms of reduced circuit complexity and increased fidelity in identifying the correct solution.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement determines the strength and range of interactions in many-body quantum systems. Yet, it is hard to evaluate it, due to the complex structures of quantum states. Here, we introduce a generic method to quantify the k <= N-partite entanglement of an N-particle system, by maximizing an arbitrary bipartite entanglement measure within subsystems of size up to k. The resulting classification of multipartite states captures their experimental cost: creating a k-partite entangled state requires at least k-1 two-particle entangling gates. Further, we analytically calculate the newly defined k-partite entanglement of formation, which generalizes an important bipartite entanglement measure, in several classes of states, including the W states of any dimension.

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) in a dissipative collective-spin model that exhibits the boundary time crystal (BTC) phase. We initialize the system in the ground state of the Hamiltonian in either the BTC or the non-BTC phase, and drive it across the BTC transition. The driving is done by an abrupt quench or by a finite-time linear ramp of a Hamiltonian control parameter under Markovian Lindblad dynamics. We diagnose DQPTs through zeros of the fidelity-based Loschmidt echo between the initial state and the evolving mixed state, which induce nonanalytic cusp-like features in the associated rate function. For quenches into the BTC phase, the Loschmidt echo exhibits repeated zeros due to the emergent time-periodic steady state, whereas for quenches into the non-BTC phase, the overlap vanishes and remains zero once the dynamics relaxes to a stationary state. We further show that the DQPT persists under the ramp protocol followed by unitary evolution with the final Hamiltonian. Finally, we analyze the finite-size scaling of the first critical time and find convergence to a constant in the thermodynamic limit, with distinct power-law approaches for the quench and the ramp protocols.

Abstract: The superconducting qubit quantum computer is one of the most promising quantum computing architectures for large-scale integration due to its maturity and close proximity to the well-established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure. From an education perspective, it also bridges classical microwave electronics and quantum electrodynamics. In this paper, we will review the basics of quantum computers, superconductivity, and Josephson junctions. We then introduce important technologies and concepts related to DiVincenzo's criteria, which are the necessary conditions for the superconducting qubits to work as a useful quantum computer. Firstly, we will discuss various types of superconducting qubits formed with Josephson junctions, from which we will understand the trade-off across multiple design parameters, including their noise immunity. Secondly, we will discuss different schemes to achieve entanglement gate operations, which are a major bottleneck in achieving more efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing. Thirdly, we will review readout engineering, including the implementations of the Purcell filters and quantum-limited amplifiers. Finally, we will discuss the nature and review the studies of two-level system defects, which are currently the limiting factor of qubit coherence time. DiVincenzo's criteria are only the necessary conditions for a technology to be eligible for quantum computing. To have a useful quantum computer, large-scale integration is required. We will review proposals and developments for the large-scale integration of superconducting qubit devices. By comparing with the application of electronic design automation (EDA) in semiconductors, we will also review the use of EDA in superconducting qubit quantum computer design, which is necessary for its large-scale integration.

Abstract: Quantum mechanics provides cryptographic primitives whose security is grounded in hardness assumptions independent of those underlying classical cryptography. However, existing proposals require low-noise quantum communication and long-lived quantum memory, capabilities which remain challenging to realize in practice. In this work, we introduce a quantum digital signature scheme that operates with only classical communication, using the classical shadows of states produced by random circuits as public keys. We provide theoretical and numerical evidence supporting the conjectured hardness of learning the private key (the circuit) from the public key (the shadow). A key technical ingredient enabling our scheme is an improved state-certification primitive that achieves higher noise tolerance and lower sample complexity than prior methods. We realize this certification by designing a high-rate error-detecting code tailored to our random-circuit ensemble and experimentally generating shadows for 32-qubit states using circuits with $\geq 80$ logical ($\geq 582$ physical) two-qubit gates, attaining 0.90 $\pm$ 0.01 fidelity. With increased number of measurement samples, our hardware-demonstrated primitives realize a proof-of-principle quantum digital signature, demonstrating the near-term feasibility of our scheme.

Abstract: We investigate the hardware requirements for quantum teleportation in an intercity-scale network topology consisting of two metropolitan-scale networks connected via a long-distance backbone link. Specifically, we identify the minimal improvements required beyond the state-of-the-art to achieve an end-to-end expected teleportation fidelity of $2/3$, which represents the classical limit. To this end, we formulate the hardware requirements computation as optimisation problems, where the hardware parameters representing the underlying device capabilities serve as decision variables. Assuming a simplified noise model, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the teleportation fidelity and rate when the network is realised using heterogeneous quantum hardware, including a quantum repeater chain with a memory cut-off. Our derivations are based on events defined by the order statistics of link generation durations in both the metropolitan networks and the backbone, and the resulting expressions are validated through simulations on the NetSquid platform. The analytical expressions facilitate efficient exploration of the optimisation parameter space without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We then apply this framework to a representative realisation in which the metropolitan nodes are based on trapped-ion processors and the backbone is composed of ensemble-based quantum memories. Our results suggest that teleportation across metropolitan distances is already achievable with state-of-the-art hardware when the data qubit is prepared after end-to-end entanglement has already been established, whereas extending teleportation to intercity scales requires additional, though plausibly achievable, improvements in hardware performance.

Abstract: We introduce a propagation-based approach to thermal state simulation by adapting Pauli and Majorana propagation to imaginary-time evolution in the Schrödinger picture. Our key observation is that high-temperature states can be sparse in the Pauli or Majorana bases, approaching the identity at infinite temperature. By formulating imaginary-time evolution directly in these operator bases and evolving from the maximally mixed state, we access a continuum of temperatures where the state remains efficiently representable. We provide analytic guarantees for small-coefficient truncation and Pauli-weight (Majorana-length) truncation strategies by quantifying the error growth and the impact of backflow. Large-scale numerics on the 1D J1-J2 model (energies) and the triangular-lattice Hubbard model (static correlations) validate efficiency at high temperatures.

Abstract: Electrochemical cells serve as a building block for producing and storing electrical energy from chemical reactions. The analysis of ion transport in these systems forms the foundation for understanding more complex electrochemical systems that are becoming increasingly present in the broader societal energy infrastructure. From a pedagogical perspective, the ``balance sheets" introduced in Chapter 4 of Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications by Alan J. Bard, Larry R. Faulkner and Henry S. White (hereafter referred to as BFW) provides a first-pass approach to analyze ion transport in electrochemical cells. However, the balance sheet approach lacks first-principles justifications from the underlying equations that describe the transport processes in electrochemical cells. In this work, we compare a first-principles approach via the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations to describe ion transport in electrochemical cells to that of the balance sheet approach. By re-working the examples presented in BFW, we illustrate that the balance sheet approach is only valid in limited scenarios. Furthermore, we show that the PNP equations provide a more physical route to analyze ion transport in electrochemical systems. We hope the approach outlined here will be adopted by electrochemical engineering researchers and instructors.

Motivation: CEI is a powerful technique to map molecular structures, especially for distinguishing isomers with similar formulas like C7H8.

Result: Momentum distributions reveal distinct differences between the isomers, showing specific carbon and hydrogen site signatures.

Conclusion: CEI can analyze ultrafast molecular motions without needing 'marker atoms.'

Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) is a powerful experimental technique that maps a molecule's geometric structure onto the momenta of ionic molecular fragments produced by rapid multiple ionization. Here, we apply CEI induced by pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser in order to image and distinguish complex hydrocarbon isomers with the chemical formula C7H8: toluene, cycloheptatriene, and 1,6-heptadiyne. The measured fragment-ion momentum distributions show discernible differences between the three isomers and provide signatures of specific carbon and hydrogen sites in the molecule. In contrast to previous work, we demonstrate that distinct 'marker atoms' are not strictly required for constructing a meaningful molecular frame of reference for the interpretation of the momentum-space data. Our work paves the way for tracking the ultrafast motion of nuclei during isomerization reactions in pure hydrocarbons.

Abstract: Density-functional theory (DFT) has become the workhorse of modern computational chemistry, with dispersion corrections such as the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model playing a key role in high-accuracy modelling of large-scale systems. All previous production implementations of XDM have used the two-parameter Becke--Johnson damping function based on atomic radii. Here, we introduce and implement a new XDM variant that uses a one-parameter damping function based on atomic numbers, recently proposed by Becke. Both this new Z damping and the canonical BJ-damping variants of XDM are benchmarked on the comprehensive GMTKN55 database using minimally empirical generalised-gradient-approximation, global hybrid, and range-separated hybrid functionals. This marks the first time that the XDM (and many-body dispersion, MBD) corrections have been tested on the GMTKN55 set. Using the new WTMAD-4 metric, an outlier analysis is performed for all new data, as well as for top-ranking functionals from the literature at each rung, providing insight into both performance and consistency across the dataset. To test Z damping's transferability to the solid state, four benchmarks involving molecular crystals are also considered.

TL;DR: UGA-SSMRPT2 is a robust, accurate, and computationally inexpensive method for computing electronic excited states, achieving near-chemical accuracy and overcoming limitations of other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exciting electrons is a critical task in many areas of chemistry and physics, and developing accurate and efficient methods for this remains a significant challenge. This paper aims to present a new method, UGA-SSMRPT2, that addresses some of these challenges.

Method: UGA-SSMRPT2 is the spin-free perturbative analogue of Mukerjee's MkMRCC, known for its success in certain applications. This work demonstrates its effectiveness as a framework for computing excitation energies.

Result: The results show that UGA-SSMRPT2 achieves near-chemical accuracy for a wide range of excited states and outperforms other methods like MRPT2 approaches such as NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT.

Conclusion: UGA-SSMRPT2 is a promising method for modeling challenging electronic excited states, offering both accuracy and computational efficiency without the need for empirical parameters.

Abstract: UGA-SSMRPT2, the spin-free perturbative analogue of Mukerjee's State-Specific Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory (MkMRCC) is known to be successful for size-extensive and intruder-free construction of dissociation curves. This work demonstrates that UGA-SSMRPT2 is also an accurate and computationally inexpensive framework for computing excitation energies. The method achieves near-chemical accuracy for the vast majority of $π\to π^*$, $n \to π^*$, charge-transfer, valence-Rydberg and Rydberg excited states commonly used for benchmarking electronic structure theories for excited states. Our results demonstrate that UGA-SSMRPT2 excitation energies lie within 0.20 eV of EOM-CCSD and/or well-established theoretical best estimates often surpassing the popular MRPT2 approaches like NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT while typically requiring smaller active spaces. Its state-specific formulation circumvents the well-known intruder-state problem and eliminates the need for empirical parameters such as IPEA shifts in CASPT2. This work proposes UGA-SSMRPT2 as a robust, and scalable approach for modeling challenging electronic excited states.

Abstract: The integration of quantum chemical methods with high-performance computing is indispensable for handling large systems with modest accuracy or even small systems but with high accuracy. Continuing with the unified implementation of non-relativistic and relativistic wave functions methods within the MetaWave platform (J. Phys. Chem. A. 2025, 129, 5170), we present here a unified MPI parallelization of the methods by abstracting ever computational step of a method as a dynamically-scheduled loop via ghost process, followed by a global reduction of local results from each node. The algorithmic abstraction enables the use of a single MPI template in various steps of different methods. Taking iCIPT2 [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 949] as a showcase, the parallel efficiencies achieve 94% and 89% on 16 nodes (1024 cores) for the perturbation and whole calculations, respectively. Further combined with an improved algorithm for the matrix-vector product in the matrix diagonalization and an orbital-configuration-based semi-stochastic estimator for the perturbation correction, this renders large active space calculations possible, so as to obtain benchmarks for the automerization of cyclobutadiene, ground state energy of benzene and potential energy profile of ozone. It is also shown that the error of iCIPT2 follows a power law with respect to the number of configuration state functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for efficient molecular representation learning, particularly in drug discovery and materials science, motivates the development of task-dependent molecular encoders.

Method: ACE-Mol learns from hundreds of motifs paired with natural language descriptors, using weak supervision, which is computationally inexpensive and scalable.

Result: ACE-Mol achieves interpretable and chemically meaningful representations, outperforming existing methods in molecular property prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACE-Mol offers a novel approach for learning task-dependent molecular representations with minimal labeled data, facilitating scalable and efficient molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Molecular representations are inherently task-dependent, yet most pre-trained molecular encoders are not. Task conditioning promises representations that reorganize based on task descriptions, but existing approaches rely on expensive labeled data. We show that weak supervision on programmatically derived molecular motifs is sufficient. Our Adaptive Chemical Embedding Model (ACE-Mol) learns from hundreds of motifs paired with natural language descriptors that are cheap to compute, trivial to scale. Conventional encoders slowly search the embedding space for task-relevant structure, whereas ACE-Mol immediately aligns its representations with the task. ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks with interpretable, chemically meaningful representations.

Conclusion: 这一研究为更全面评估非共价相互作用和其可扩展性提供了更深入的参考。

Abstract: In a recent contribution [Fishman, V.; Lesiuk, M.; Martin, J.M.L.; Boese, A.D., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 2311-2324], we introduced another angle at benchmarking non-covalent interactions by not just benchmarking interaction energies of different species, but by considering the evolution of interaction energies with increasing system size.
  Here, we extend the benchmark set to more species, such as electrostatically bound borazine dimers as well as the minima structures of parallel displaced acene and coronene dimers. While the minimum structures of the parallel displaced acene dimers yield similar results to previously published sandwich-structured acenes, the borazine dimers behave vastly different, yielding yet a more complete picture on non-covalent interactions and their scalability. In contrast, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon structures -- coronenes sandwich-stacked and coronenes parallel displaced -- give results consistent with those obtained for both types of the polyacene series, resulting in an updated estimate for the coronene dimer energy.

*Prateek Vaish,Brenda Rubenstein*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Active space UCCSD(4)/MP2 with canonical orbitals can efficiently model weak to moderately correlated systems, like molecules and reactions, but fails for strongly correlated systems like ethylene torsion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving UCC methods is crucial for accurate electronic structure calculations, especially for quantum applications.

Method: The proposed approach uses UCCSD(4)/MP2 within an active space, with two variants: a composite method and an interacting method, employing either separate or coupled amplitudes.

Result: The interacting method shows better performance with shortened active spaces, accurately replicating UCCSD(4) results, but both formulations struggle with strong static correlation, like in ethylene torsion.

Conclusion: This framework provides an efficient method for classical computing but needs further adaptation for quantum hardware to handle strong correlations.

Abstract: Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) theory is a promising variational method for electronic structure calculations, especially for strongly correlated systems and quantum computers. However, its practical application is limited by the steep scaling of its non-terminating Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We introduce an active space UCCSD(4)/MP2 approach that leverages a fourth-order many-body perturbation theory truncation of UCCSD within a selected active space, while treating external excitations at the MP2 level. We explore two variants: a composite method that sums separate internal and external contributions and an interacting method that couples the amplitudes for greater accuracy. We test our approach on the GW100 dataset, a metaphosphate hydrolysis reaction, and the strongly correlated torsion of ethylene. Our results suggest that the interacting method with canonical orbitals is robust for weakly and moderately correlated systems and accurately reproduces the full UCCSD(4) potential energy curves using only 15-25% of the virtual orbitals in its active space. In comparison, the composite formulation exhibits greater sensitivity to the orbital basis and active space size, leading to less systematic behavior across the benchmark set. For ethylene torsion, a system dominated by strong static correlation, both composite and interacting formulations employing canonical orbitals closely track the full UCCSD(4) reference but do not alleviate the unphysical features inherited from the underlying single-reference UCCSD(4) description. This active space framework offers a tractable approach for modeling correlated molecules and reactions on classical computers and provides a viable path for scaling UCC calculations for resource-constrained quantum hardware.

Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to create a more human-like and precise tool for molecular geometry manipulation, addressing the limitations of generative models that can't directly control atomic or molecular structures as humans do.

Method: The method involves integrating a comprehensive set of domain-informed tools and a vision-language model into a natural-language-driven agent, which allows it to perform precise molecular geometry manipulations in three dimensions.

Result: The result is a novel agent, El Agente Estructural, which successfully performs a wide range of chemically meaningful geometry manipulations and demonstrates its effectiveness across various applications.

Conclusion: Estructural represents a significant advancement in autonomous molecular modeling, offering a powerful tool for chemists and researchers via precise, human-like manipulations of molecular systems.

Abstract: We present El Agente Estructural, a multimodal, natural-language-driven geometry-generation and manipulation agent for autonomous chemistry and molecular modelling. Unlike molecular generation or editing via generative models, Estructural mimics how human experts directly manipulate molecular systems in three dimensions by integrating a comprehensive set of domain-informed tools and vision-language models. This design enables precise control over atomic or functional group replacements, atomic connectivity, and stereochemistry without the need to rebuild extensive core molecular frameworks. Through a series of representative case studies, we demonstrate that Estructural enables chemically meaningful geometry manipulation across a wide range of real-world scenarios. These include site-selective functionalization, ligand binding, ligand exchange, stereochemically controlled structure construction, isomer interconversion, fragment-level structural analysis, image-guided generation of structures from schematic reaction mechanisms, and mechanism-driven geometry generation and modification. These examples illustrate how multimodal reasoning, when combined with specialized geometry-aware tools, supports interactive and context-aware molecular modelling beyond structure generation. Looking forward, the integration of Estructural into El Agente Quntur, an autonomous multi-agent quantum chemistry platform, enhances its capabilities by adding sophisticated tools for the generation and editing of three-dimensional structures.

Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a foundational enabling tool for the fields of chemistry, materials science, computational biology and others. Despite of its power, the practical application of quantum chemistry simulations remains in the hands of qualified experts due to methodological complexity, software heterogeneity, and the need for informed interpretation of results. To bridge the accessibility gap for these tools and expand their reach to chemists with broader backgrounds, we introduce El Agente Quntur, a hierarchical, multi-agent AI system designed to operate not merely as an automation tool but as a research collaborator for computational quantum chemistry. Quntur was designed following three main strategies: i) elimination of hard-coded procedural policies in favour of reasoning-driven decisions, ii) construction of general and composable actions that facilitate generalization and efficiency, and iii) implementation of guided deep research to integrate abstract quantum-chemical reasoning across subdisciplines and a detailed understanding of the software's internal logic and syntax. Although instantiated in ORCA, these design principles are applicable to research agents more generally and easily expandable to additional quantum chemistry packages and beyond. Quntur supports the full range of calculations available in ORCA 6.0 and reasons over software documentation and scientific literature to plan, execute, adapt, and analyze in silico chemistry experiments following best practices. We discuss the advances and current bottlenecks in agentic systems operating at the research level in computational chemistry, and outline a roadmap toward a fully autonomous end-to-end computational chemistry research agent.

Abstract: The deautonomisation of birational maps that have the singularity confinement property, i.e. the construction of nonautonomous versions of such maps that preserve the singularity properties of the original, has proven crucial in our understanding of the mathematical properties behind the integrability of second order maps. For example, the deautonomisation procedure led directly to the development of a general theory of discrete Painlevé equations, and it seems highly likely it will play a crucial role in any future theory of higher dimensional Painlevé equations as well. Generally speaking however, higher order integrable mappings may have non-confined singularities and it is important to understand if, and how, deautonomisation should work for such mappings. In this paper we explore different deautonomisation scenarios on a series of carefully constructed higher order mappings, integrable as well as non-integrable, that possess non-confined singularities and we challenge some common assumptions regarding the co-dimensionality of the singular loci that might play a role in the deautonomisation process. Along the way we also propose a novel procedure to calculate the growth of the multiplicities of singularities that appear in so-called anticonfined singularity patterns, based on an ultradiscrete version of the mapping.

Conclusion: 扩展了 AKNS 系统的解，对非线性波具有广泛影响

Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painleve solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painleve solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painleve transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a different symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painleve IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painleve IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of the hydrogen concentration is critical for optimizing fuel cell performance, minimizing purge losses, and reducing long-term degradation. Conventional hydrogen sensors often rely on catalytic materials and face limitations such as the need of oxygen purging when operated in fuel cell environments. Here, we report the discovery of a novel hydrogen-sensing mechanism based on organic molecules, without the use of catalytic metals. The sensor is based on a typical vertical stack geometry, containing $\mathrm{Alq_3}$ as active organic material. Upon exposure to hydrogen, the device shows an increase in resistivity, yielding a reliable sensor signal that varies linearly with hydrogen concentration, temperature, and humidity, and exhibits a relative response of up to 3.5 % at 100 %vol hydrogen. By exposing the sensor to an external magnetic field, the rise and fall times of the sensor response were found to be tunable. This novel organic sensor demonstrates sensitivity across a wide range of hydrogen concentrations under fuel cell-relevant conditions and beyond. This new class of hydrogen sensors with high miniaturization potential and cost efficiency paves the way for real-time hydrogen monitoring and advanced control strategies in fuel cells, the chemical industry, or energy storage applications.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores model order reduction (MOR) techniques for large-scale vibroacoustic simulations, comparing traditional methods and developing a scalable benchmark for evaluation. It highlights a Krylov subspace-based technique as the most efficient and accurate for systems with over 100,000 DOF, achieving up to 600× speedup while maintaining accuracy. The approach ensures feasibility even on high-performance workstations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With increasing complexity of vibroacoustic simulations, reducing computational cost becomes crucial. MOR methods are essential for handling large, multi-domain systems efficiently, and this study aims to identify optimal techniques for such systems.

Method: The paper compares harmonic response simulations using MOR techniques like modal methods and Krylov subspace methods across multi-domain systems. It implements a benchmark model to evaluate the performance of these methods, focusing on the scalability and accuracy for systems with varying DOF sizes up to 1,000,000. The Krylov subspace two-level orthogonal Arnoldi reduction, combined with matrix conditioning, is tested and found to be the most effective approach for large-scale models.

Result: The study identifies that the Krylov subspace two-level orthogonal Arnoldi reduction outperforms other methods, providing a significant speedup while maintaining accuracy. This method is particularly effective for large-scale vibroacoustic simulations, enabling efficient computation even for extremely large models.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that advanced MOR techniques, especially the Krylov subspace-based approach, are essential for optimizing large-scale vibroacoustic simulations. This study contributes a scalable benchmark for evaluating MOR methods and provides a robust solution for handling systems with up to a million degrees of freedom.

Abstract: Model Order Reduction (MOR) can significantly reduce the computational cost of vibroacoustic simulations. While most MOR research focuses on single-domain systems (e.g., structural dynamics or computational fluid mechanics), this work compares MOR techniques for large multi-domain problems to identify methods that remain efficient and accurate at very large scales. In particular, harmonic response simulations of vibroacoustic fluid-structure coupled systems used to compute transfer functions from an input force to either structural acceleration or pressure in the heavy fluid domain are of high interest. To achieve this, the most common MOR techniques based on modal methods and Krylov subspace methods are compared for multi-material systems. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of these techniques for different system sizes, a scalable benchmark model of a water-filled Plexiglass cylinder is developed, with mesh sizes from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). The quality of the models is assured by validation against experimental data. The geometry, model data, and experimental results are made available so that they can be used as a benchmark for further studies. For systems larger than 100,000 DOF, the investigated modal methods become impractical due to memory limitations, even on powerful workstations. Among the tested techniques, a Krylov subspace two-level orthogonal Arnoldi reduction, combined with symmetrization and conditioning of the system matrices, provides the most accurate and efficient approximation of the target transfer functions - particularly for large-scale models up to 1,000,000 DOF. This approach achieves a speedup of up to 600 times compared to the full model.

Abstract: Interface roughness scattering is an important limiting factor for achieving high performance Quantum Cascade Lasers. Following recent results, we study the growth conditions for a strain-compensated QCL emitting around 4.6 μm grown on a (511)A InP substrate using AFM and XRD measurements. We find that modulating the arsenic flux and correctly tailoring the III/V ratio is fundamental to achieve a good quality material. We report the first lasing device on such a platform with a current density threshold of 1.34 kA/cm2 and a slope efficiency of 1.1 W/A, which result suboptimal compared to the (100) reference. Finally, we find a 7% redshift of the (511)A spectrum which we attribute to an impurity scattering due to the increased incorporation along the exposed (111) direction. We validate this statement by verifying that the change in CBO and effective electron mass due to strain along a non-trivial direction cannot cause such a shift by using the k-p method generalized to arbitrary growth directions

Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative nonperturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate deep learning with physical prior knowledge, have proven to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The present work utilizes PINNs to analyze the existence and evolution of quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), revealing the ability of this technique to accurately predict structural features of the QDs, their multipeak profiles, and dynamical behavior. The stable evolution of multipole QDs is thus demonstrated. Comparing different network architectures, including the training time, loss values, and $\mathbb{L_{2}}$ error, PINNs accurately predict specific dynamical characteristics of QDs. Furthermore, the PINN robustness is evaluated by the application of PINN to parameter-discovery tasks, considering both clean training data and data contaminated by $1\%$ random noise.

Abstract: We study the density modulation of an interacting Fermi gas caused by the uniform motion of an impurity at zero temperature. For strong enough interaction among Fermi atoms, the modulation propagates thanks to the excitation of the collective zero sound mode if the impurity speed is above the zero sound threshold. We are able to assess, via a semi-analytic evaluation, the extent of the zero sound contribution to the density oscillation over and above the incoherent background of particle-hole excitations. Given the strong dependence of the results on the features of the gas interaction potential, we also analyze how they vary depending on its strength, range and shape.

Abstract: We study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium formation of four-particle complexes in a balanced two-species Bose-Hubbard model with repulsive intra- and attractive inter-species interactions. Using exact diagonalization, we characterize the transition from weakly- to strongly-correlated dimer and tetramer states along the one- to two-dimensional crossover in coupled-chain geometries by combining local correlation signatures with global diagnostics such as the binding energy and interspecies entanglement entropy. We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity. Our results provide a microscopic framework for engineering and probing few-body bosonic bound states in tunable lattice geometries.

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了一维映射到二维映射的理论，确认了普适性和系统动力学的关键特性。

Abstract: We present a phenomenological description of the critical slowing down associated with period-doubling bifurcations in discrete dynamical systems. Starting from a local Taylor expansion around the fixed point and the bifurcation parameter, we derive a reduced description that captures the convergence towards stationary state both at and near criticality. At the bifurcation point, three universal critical exponents are obtained, characterising the short-time behaviour, the asymptotic decay, and the crossover between these regimes. Away from criticality, a fourth exponent governing the relaxation time is identified. We show this phenomenology, well established for one-dimensional maps, extends naturally to two-dimensional mappings. By projecting the dynamics onto the centre manifold, we demonstrate that the local normal form of a two-dimensional period-doubling bifurcation reduces to the same universal structure found in one dimension. The theoretical predictions are validated numerically using the Hénon and Ikeda maps, showing excellent agreement for all scaling laws and critical exponents.

Motivation: 论文分析了在对流-扩散算子的频谱结构特征，尤其是在高对流率和复杂的相空间结构中。通过使用傅里叶离散化和Krylov-Arnoldi方法，研究了不同流场区域的特征值行为，发现了不同的特征模式和间隔现象。

Method: 使用了傅里叶离散化方法结合对称性缩减和Krylov-Arnoldi方法，构建了高阶特征值问题的解法，搜索了大量特征值，详细研究了频谱结构。

Result: 主要结果包括：主特征值渐近于扩散主导，局部化于最大正则区域；更宽的频谱区域表明局部拉格朗日相空间几何对频谱的组织有显著影响；指数的混合在整个混沌区域迅速消除相关性；而在可积分的区域中存在长时间的相干结构；研究发现了三种不同类型的特征模式：与不变环面相关的运输模式、扩散模式和弱连接不同类型区域的隧道效应模式。

Conclusion: 结论表明：在强对流率下，二维对流-扩散算子的频谱结构 Liaqian的复杂性。研究发现特征值结构表现出三种不同的家族特征，包括与惯性环面相关的模式，扩散模式以及稀有隧道效应模式。尽管主特征值具有较低的扩散主导特性，但随着模式的深入，存在指数与代数的混合效应，导致特征值的复杂分布。研究揭示了不同区域的动态行为与特征值的连接性关系。这表明，在强对流率情况下，有限时间的对流-扩散过程通常由多个模式竞争所主导，而不在某一个模式占优的情况。这种现象表明，传统上认为的单模式控制并不成立，特别是在高对流率的极限下。

Abstract: We examine the spectral structure of the two-dimensional advection-diffusion operator in flows with mixed phase space at very large Peclet number. Using Fourier discretization combined with symmetry reduction and Krylov-Arnoldi methods, we compute on the order of one hundred leading eigenpairs reliably in the asymptotic, weak-diffusion regime. While the principal eigenvalue is asymptotically diffusive and localized on the largest regular region, the broader spectrum exhibits a rich organization controlled by local Lagrangian phase-space geometry. In particular, exponential mixing in chaotic regions rapidly suppresses correlations, whereas algebraic mixing in integrable regions generates long-lived coherent structures that dominate the slow and intermediate parts of the spectrum. We identify three distinct classes of eigenmodes: advective modes associated with transport on invariant tori, diffusive modes and, within the duffusive branch, tunneling modes arising from weak coupling between dynamically separated regular regions. Drawing on a semiclassical analogy, we assign quantum-number-like labels to these families and predict the appearance, scaling, and ordering of their sub-spectra directly from the Hamiltonian phase-space structure. The coexistence of these families implies that no uniform control of the spectral gap exists across the full spectrum: although the slowest mode is diffusive, arbitrarily small gaps arise between competing families at higher mode numbers. As a result, finite-time advection-diffusion dynamics is generically governed by persistent modal competition rather than single-mode dominance, even at asymptotically large Peclet number.

Conclusion: nc-Li↔Li-CN体系中，通过semiclassical方法理解了quantum谐振与classical bifurcation的关系。

Abstract: Bifurcations take place in molecular Hamiltonian nonlinear systems as the excitation energy increases, this leading to the appearance of different classical resonances. In this paper, we study the quantum manifestations of these classical resonances in the isomerizing system CN-Li$\leftrightarrows$Li-CN. By using a correlation diagram of eigenenergies versus Planck constant, we show the existence of different series of avoided crossings, leading to the corresponding series of quantum resonances, which represent the quantum manifestations of the classical resonances. Moreover, the extrapolation of these series to $\hbar=0$ unveils the correspondence between the bifurcation energy of classical resonances and the energy of the series of quantum resonances in the semiclassical limit $\hbar\to0$. Additionally, in order to obtain analytical expressions for our results, a semiclassical theory is developed.

Motivation: Understanding how non-Hermitian disorder induces novel topological phases is crucial for advancing quantum materials research.

Method: The study used the Jx lattice with ABBA-type non-Hermitian disorder, observing phase transitions from trivial insulators to a stable anomalous non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator.

Result: A quantized polarization of approximately 0.25 was observed, indicating a distinct topological phase protected by a mobility gap.

Conclusion: Non-Hermitian disorder can protect and induce new topological orders, expanding our understanding of topological phenomena in open quantum systems.

Abstract: Strong disorder drives conventional Hermitian systems into Anderson insulating states, suppressing all topological phases. Here, we unveil symmetry-protected, anomalous topological phases in the strong disorder limit of a non-Hermitian system, characterized by a scale-invariant merging of zero-energy modes. Using the maximally symmetric Jx lattice as an ideal platform and introducing specifically engineered (ABBA-type) symmetry-preserving non-Hermitian disorder, we observe a sequence of disorder-induced phase transitions: from a trivial insulator into and through a non-Hermitian topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phase, culminating in a stable anomalous non-Hermitian TAI phase characterized by a quantized polarization P_x \approx 0.25. Within this anomalous phase protected by the mobility gap, the zero-energy modes exhibit a distinct (N/2)-mode coalescence that scales with system size. Our findings demonstrate that non-Hermitian disorder engineered to preserve symmetry can induce and protect novel topological order inaccessible to conventional Hermitian disorder, thereby advancing the fundamental understanding of topological phenomena mediated by the interplay of disorder and non-Hermiticity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Electroluminescence spectra of a silicon nanostructure with edge channels covered by chains of dipole centers with negative correlation energy are demonstrated. The presence of such chains provides conditions for nondissipative transport of single charge carriers at high temperatures up to room temperature. Due to the suppression of the electron-electron interactions, the macroscopic quantum phenomena such as Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations and the quantum staircase of Hall resistance are consistent with the positions of the spectral peaks of the detected electroluminescence. The obtained results are considered in the framework of Faraday electromagnetic induction, which indicates that Landau quantization leads to the emergence of induced irradiation similar to Josephson and Andreev generation. Moreover, the detected maxima in the spectral characteristics correspond to odd fractional values of the resistance quantum staircases, while the dips in the electroluminescence spectra are observed at even fractional values of the resistance quantum ladder, which is due to the increased formation of composite bosons and fermions, respectively.

Abstract: When does a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquid crystallize? Addressing this question requires a framework that treats fractionalization and crystallization on equal footing, especially in strong Landau-level mixing regime. Here, we introduce MagNet, a self-attention neural-network variational wavefunction designed for quantum systems in magnetic fields on the torus geometry. We show that MagNet provides a unifying and expressive ansatz capable of describing both FQH states and electron crystals within the same architecture. Trained solely by energy minimization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, MagNet discovers topological liquid and electron crystal ground states across a broad range of Landau-level mixing. Our results highlight the power of first-principles AI for solving strongly interacting many-body problems and finding competing phases without external training data or physics pre-knowledge.

Abstract: We study the current-induced torques in bilayers composed of a light 3d metal, chromium, and a rare-earth ferromagnet with finite orbital moments, terbium, utilizing second-harmonic Hall-response measurements. The dampinglike torque efficiency of chromium is found to be positive and reaches ~3.66 in this system, in sharp contrast to the negative and subtle dampinglike torque efficiency in general Cr/ferromagnet heterostructures with quenched orbital moment. We suggest that the orbital currents generated by the orbital Hall effect in Cr can be injected into Tb with negligible loss at the interface and then efficiently interact with the orbital moments. Our work implies that orbital currents could be harnessed to manipulate the orbital magnetization of materials, which would advance the development of orbitronics.

Conclusion: The findings provide a universal framework for understanding topology beyond Chern classes in perfectly flat bands and open a tunable platform for exploring quantum geometry and interaction-driven phases.

Abstract: Perfectly flat bands with nontrivial quantum geometry have emerged as a frontier for exotic topological phenomena and superconductors. Here, we unveil a universal family of quantized Berry-dipole flat bands in chiral-symmetric (2n+1)-band systems, where the central perfectly flat band carries a Berry-dipole moment d=n, with n an arbitrary integer, while preserving zero Chern number. We construct explicit lattice models to showcase three topological phenomena characterized by the Berry-dipole moment: a flat-band returning pump featuring bidirectional, soliton-like displacement of Wannier centers by exactly n unit cells per half cycle, a dipolar Haldane phase diagram arising from the competition between time-reversal and parity symmetries, and n pairs of bulk helical zero modes whose existence depends on the orientation of pseudomagnetic field. Our findings establish a universal framework for the topology beyond Chern class in perfectly flat bands and provide a tunable platform for exploring quantum geometry and interaction-driven phases.

Abstract: The piezomagnetic effect-strain-induced linear modulation of magnetization, arises in magnets with broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS), offering a pathway to bidirectional strain-based control of magnetism, which is an essential straintronic and spintronic functionality in solids. Metallic antiferromagnets with BTRS provide an ideal platform to study this effect through transport measurements, yet experimental demonstrations are limited. Van der Waals (vdW) nanomagnets, with their mechanical flexibility, are particularly promising for realizing large piezomagnetic responses and effective transport control. Here we demonstrate piezomagnetic control of electronic transport in nano-devices of the vdW antiferromagnets CoNb$_3$S$_6$ and CoTa$_3$S$_6$, archetypal vdW metals with BTRS that exhibit a spontaneous Hall effect. Applying uniaxial strain linearly modulates both the antiferromagnetic transition temperature and coercive field, consistent with strain-driven tuning of exchange coupling, key signatures of the piezomagnetic effect. Moreover, spontaneous Hall effect is controllable via strain, evidencing piezomagnetic tuning of Berry curvature and its associated geometric transport. These findings establish piezomagnetism as a powerful route to manipulate antiferromagnetic transport, opening avenues for straintronic and spintronic applications in vdW magnetic systems.

Abstract: The Rashba-split two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) at the surface and interface of insulating oxides like KTaO$_{3}$ (KTO) shows great promise for all-oxide spintronics. However, efficient spin current injection into the adjacent 2DEG remains a key challenge. In this study, we report the spin-pumping experiments on a 2DEG formed on the (001)KTO surface via Ar$^+$ irradiation. We observed a significant increase in magnetic damping in the Ar$^+$-KTO/Py bilayer compared to a non-irradiated KTO/Py control sample, confirming spin pumping into the 2DEG. We demonstrate that the spin-mixing conductance ($g_{\uparrow\downarrow}^r$) can be substantially enhanced by controlling the Ar$^+$ irradiation time. The enhancement is attributed to increased 2DEG conductance, which results from a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies with longer irradiation times. This work provides crucial guidance for optimizing spin-to-charge conversion in KTO-based systems, highlighting the potential of Ar$^+$-irradiated KTO 2DEGs for future oxide spintronics.

In addition, we study the role of resonantly excited carriers, and we show that the amplitude and coherence time of the electronic wavepacket depend on the pre-excited carrier density. Further, we demonstrate that under certain conditions, the Raman-type excitation changes to displacive impulsive excitation, which allows us to address the Raman-forbidden transition between $1s\left(A_1\right)$ and $1s\left(T_1\right)$.

Abstract: The discovery of fractional charge excitations in new platforms offers crucial insights into strongly correlated quantum phases. While a range of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have recently been observed in two-dimensional twisted moire systems, the theoretically anticipated filling factor v = -1/3 FQAH state has remained elusive, with debates centering on its nature of charge density wave or a topological Chern insulator. Here, we report the optical detection of a v = -1/3 FQAH state in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Using photoluminescence (PL) and reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) techniques, we identify ferromagnetic states at filling factors v = -1, -2/3, and -1/3, all tunable by a vertical electric field. The corresponding Curie temperatures are approximately 11 K, 3.5 K, and 2.4 K, respectively. The -1/3 state emerges over a narrower electric field range and a lower temperature compared to the integer and other fractional states, indicating its fragile nature that may lead to its absence in previous reports. Notably, the PL spectra at v = -1/3 disperse as the out-of-plane magnetic field increases, consistent with a nontrivial topological origin. Theoretical calculations based on the exact diagonalization method further support the interpretation of this topologically non-trivial state.

Motivation: The study of novel magnetic materials, especially those combining antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic properties, is crucial for advancing spintronic and quantum computing technologies.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of altermagnetic materials. The findings offer insights into designing topological spintronic devices, which could enable next-generation electronics with enhanced speed and efficiency.

Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently emerged as a third fundamental branch of magnetism, combining the vanishing net magnetization of antiferromagnets with the high-momentum-dependent spin splitting of ferromagnets. This study provides a comprehensive real- and momentum-space analysis of topological phases in two-dimensional d-wave altermagnets. By employing a tight-binding Hamiltonian, we characterize the topological phase transition occurring at a critical intra-sublattice hopping strength ($t_a^C$). We examine the emergence of Dirac nodal points and the resulting Berry curvature singularities, supported by a visual analysis of pseudospin texture winding. Crucially, we analize spin splitting, effective altermagnetic strength, and investigate the transport implications of these phases, uncovering giant conductivity anisotropy and spin-dependent "steering" effects driven by group velocity distribution across the Fermi surface. Beyond bulk properties, we analyze the edge state topology in ribbon geometries through the lens of information-theoretic markers like fidelity-susceptibility and inverse participation ratio, offering an alternative to traditional Chern number calculations. Our results demonstrate that the hybridization of edge states in ultra-narrow nanoribbons opens a controllable energy gap, a feature we exploit to propose a novel topological altermagnetic field-effect transistor design where ballistic and spatially spin-polarized transport can be electrostatically gated. This work establishes a theoretical and information-theoretic framework for "edgetronics" in altermagnetic materials, paving the way for next-generation, high-speed spintronic and "spin-splitter" logic devices and architectures.

Abstract: In the Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFT) that describes the exotic models XY-plaquette and XYZ-cube, we construct codim-1 condensation defects by higher gauging with discrete torsion the non-compact symmetry of the bulk. In the framework of SymTFT Mille-feuille, which captures the Lorentz-invariance breaking subsystem symmetries, these models are dual to foliated versions of Maxwell theory. We show first that the XY-plaquette model admits a $θ$-term. Then, we show these condensation defects realize non-invertible self-duality symmetries at any value of the coupling. In the XYZ-cube model such symmetry is discrete. On the other hand, we find that the XY-plaquette has a non-invertible continuous $SO(2)$ symmetry, thus extending the results in the current literature.

Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of particle-like topological solitons with degenerate masses and their mixing due to world-line instantons. Previously, this phenomenon was studied in 1+1-dimensional setups. Here we take a step further and consider degenerate vortices in 2+1 dimensions. We find that, while classically such vortices may be degenerate, they generally mix and split at the quantum level. Supersymmetry protects BPS-saturated vortices only when the number of supercharges in the bulk is large enough.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ D-type orbi-instanton superconformal field theories (SCFTs) and their torus compactifications to four-dimensional class $\mathcal{S}$ theories. By analysing a general class of 6d F-theory constructions via generalised quivers, we demonstrate that -- in contrast to the well-characterised A-type series -- the dimensional reductions that admit a 4d class $\mathcal{S}$ description on a Riemann sphere with three untwisted D-type punctures constitute only a subset of the full orbi-instanton landscape. For this subclass, we show that the punctures can be effectively characterised by two sets of integers: the $s$-labels and the $m$-labels. The $s$-labels, or ``Kac-type labels'', serve as the D-type analogues to the Kac labels used in A-type theories; we establish their correspondence with ``modified excess numbers'' in the associated 3d mirror theories (magnetic quivers). The $m$-labels are further introduced to streamline the mapping from 6d generalised quivers to their class $\mathcal{S}$ descriptions. Furthermore, we analyse physical distinctions arising from 6d $θ$ angles and explore the hierarchy of Higgs branch flows. In doing so, we uncover instances of ``hidden Higgsings'' -- renormalization group flows present in the 6d parent theories that are not manifest in the puncture closures of the corresponding class $\mathcal{S}$ descriptions.

Abstract: We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $Δ\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.

Abstract: Conservation of super-horizon tensor fluctuations is crucial for connecting inflation to observations. Starting from first principles, recent works have found violations of this conservation if free-streaming radiation is produced during reheating. We show that the non-conservation is sensitive to the radiation initial state, and argue that the physical state should be affected by tensor perturbations that are already present during reheating. The deviation from super-horizon conservation is then negligible, recovering the standard result from kinetic theory. In contrast, a globally homogeneous and isotropic plasma state leads to a large suppression of tensor amplitudes. This difference between the local (physical) and global thermal equilibrium settles the discrepancy between the older and recent literature.

Abstract: We study bulk locality in a scalar effective field theory (EFT) in AdS background in presence of an end-of-the-world (EOW) brane. The holographic dual description is given in terms of a boundary conformal field theory (BCFT). We compute the two point correlation function of scalar operators in the BCFT using the one-loop Witten diagrams and compare its analytic structure with the constraints imposed by boundary conformal symmetry. We find that the loop-corrected correlator derived from a local bulk description is not fully compatible with BCFT expectations. This result places nontrivial constraint on bulk locality in holographic BCFT constructions and identifies BCFT correlators as sensitive probes of quantum bulk dynamics in presence of boundaries.

Abstract: Relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) is commonly formulated in terms of operators, asymptotic states, and covariant amplitudes, a perspective that tends to obscure the real-time origin of field dynamics and correlations. Here we formulate quantum fields in a real-time Schrödinger-picture framework, in which fields evolve as probability ensembles on the space of field configurations. Within this formulation, the wavefunctional $Ψ[φ,t]$ encodes a first-order, causal ensemble dynamics on configuration space. Interactions appear as couplings between configuration-space directions, while propagators arise as derived correlation structures rather than as fundamental postulates. Entanglement, scattering amplitudes, and conformal field theory correlators emerge as distinct projections of the same underlying ensemble evolution, corresponding to equal-time, asymptotic, and symmetry-organized observables. Standard operator, diagrammatic, and path-integral formulations are recovered as computational representations of this single real-time dynamics. This organization makes explicit the distinction between fundamental dynamical structure and representational tools in QFT, and clarifies the scope within which ensemble-averaged correlators account for quantum fluctuations, while also delineating the level at which questions associated with individual realizations and randomness would arise beyond the correlator-based field-theoretic description.

All quantum corrections are found explicitly and factored into a coefficient at the classical potential.

Abstract: We review the general formalism of duality rotations for $\cal N$-extended (super)conformal gauge multiplets of arbitrary (super)spin in four dimensions, with ${\cal N} \geq 0$. Self-dual models for a vector field (${\cal N}=0$) and for ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ vector supermultiplets are naturally formulated on general (super)gravity backgrounds. For all other (super)spin values, the corresponding self-dual systems are realised on arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds. Every $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant model is demonstrated to be self-dual with respect to a Legendre transformation. Methods are proposed to generate such self-dual models including superconformal ones. We show that every model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics admits a higher-spin extension. Throughout the review, we make use of the formalism of conformal (super)space, that is the geometric setting to describe the gauge theory of the (super)conformal group.

Abstract: Feynman integrals whose associated geometries extend beyond the Riemann sphere, such as elliptic curves and Calabi-Yau varieties, are increasingly relevant in modern precision calculations. They arise not only in collider cross-section calculations, but also in the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational-wave scattering. A powerful approach to compute integrals of this type is via differential equations, particularly when cast in a canonical form, which simplifies their $\varepsilon$-expansion and makes analytic properties manifest. In these proceedings, we will present a method to systematically construct canonical differential equations even for integrals that evaluate beyond multiple polylogarithms. The discussion is kept as light as possible, focusing on the two-loop sunrise integral, deferring the technical details to the original publications.

Abstract: We study the holographic Fermion as a probe over the background with ionic lattice, which may undergo a phase transition with the development of charge density wave by the spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. We focus on the structure of the Fermi surface within different Brillouin zones and demonstrate how the presence of CDW in the background affects the formation of the band gap in the momentum space. Specifically, we find the formation of the CDW enhances the amplitude of spectral function as well as the momentum of the Fermi surface. Furthermore, we are concerned with the change of the Fermi surface with the doping parameter as well as the lattice amplitude. Interestingly, we find that the radius of the Fermi surface expands with the increase of the doping parameter and finally may cross the first Brillouin zone. Additionally, the width of band gap becomes larger with the increase of the lattice amplitude as well, which is consistent with the observation in condensed matter experiments.

To this end, we employ the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, in which the CH construction is shown in arXiv:2509.22080. As a result, the CH construction works in an intricate way alongside the YB deformations. Remarkably, the resulting deformed action can also be expressed as the sum of the master formula Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This result indicates the universality of the correction term.

Abstract: The explicit description and computation of functions defined on Riemann surfaces of various genera depends on the choice of language: while the Jacobi parametrization is widely known and used, the Schottky uniformization has been proven to provide an alternative approach, useful in particular for (but not limited to) numerical calculations. Despite capturing the geometry of the Riemann surface completely, the two languages are subject to rather different sets of auxiliary symmetries. In this article we translate and compare the symplectic transformations inherent in the Jacobi parametrization to the freedom in choosing Möbius transformations generating the Schottky group for the Schottky uniformization. Our results are aimed at transferring functional relations expressed in the Schottky language to the Jacobi language and vice versa. An immediate application would be the efficient numerical evaluation of special functions in a physics context by favorably tuning the Schottky cover leading to quicker convergence.

Abstract: Gauge-invariant polynomial functions of matrix and tensor variables capture combinatorial structures of gauge-string duality, which can be usefully organised using finite-dimensional associative algebras. I review recent work on eigenvalue systems using these algebras as state spaces, which provide efficient computational algorithms for the construction of orthogonal bases in the multi-matrix case. Algebraic counting formulae in matrix and tensor systems with $U(N)$ as well as $S_N$ symmetry have led to gauged quantum mechanical models which display a negative branch of specific heat capacity in the micro-canonical ensemble followed by positive specific heat capacity at larger energies measured by a polynomial degree parameter $n$. The negative branch is associated with near-exponential or factorial growth of degeneracies for $ n \gg 1$ in a region of large $N$ stability, while the positive branch occurs when the finite $N$ reduction of degrees of freedom takes over as $n$ becomes sufficiently large compared to $N$.

Abstract: We consider tunnel ionization of atomic argon in a femtosecond laser pulse of intensity $10^{21}-10^{22}{\rm W/cm}^2$ aiming to investigate the relativistic dynamics and radiation of photoelectrons released from their parent ions inside the laser focus. Radiation of such electrons accelerated along the laser field propagation direction appears to have moderate power but can be considerably enhanced by a collision with a relatively weak counter-propagating laser pulse. Using the theory of laser-induced tunneling in atoms and ions and that of nonlinear Thomson scattering, we demonstrate that angular distributions and spectra of emitted photons can serve as a probe of the peak intensity in the focus. The angular distribution of emitted radiation in the plane of polarization and propagation of the ionizing laser beam appears narrow and peaked around an intensity-dependent angle, making this ionization setup a source of collimated XUV radiation.

Conclusion:  bounce参数与phantom单极子显著影响了黑洞的物理和几何特性，细微调整能显著影响视界与光球特征。

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and shadow of a non-rotating Simpson Visser black hole with a phantom global monopole. The model is governed by three parameters: the coupling constant $ξ$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, and the bounce parameter $a$, which jointly influence horizon structure and observational signatures. Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $η$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case. Our results highlight how the bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly alter the black hole's physical and geometric properties.

Abstract: This study investigates the Renyi Holographic dark energy, Sharma-Mittal Holographic dark energy and Generalized Holographic dark energy models in the framework of $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^2$ represents the self-contraction of the stress-energy tensor. For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This study highlights the deep interconnections between holographic dark energy models and modified gravity theories, offering valuable insights into the large scale dynamics of the cosmos.

Abstract: The gravitational lensing of relativistic and nonrelativistic neutral massive particles in the black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is investigated in the strong deflection limit. Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens.

Abstract: The gravimagnetic dipole is an asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's General Relativity describing two non-extreme black holes with equal masses and opposite NUT charges connected by a Misner string. The string tension's can be set to zero by choosing the black hole separation accordingly, yielding a stable system of oppositely rotating black holes at a fixed distance. Numerical simulations of massless particle geodesics reveal gravitational lensing effects for extended sources at infinity on the equatorial plane or on the vertical axis.

Abstract: We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordström and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordström black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.

Abstract: Photon spheres have attracted considerable interest in the studies of black holes and other astrophysical objects. For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\text{stable}} + n_{\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.

### [103] [Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04642)
*Honglue Tang,Jinzhao Yang,Baoxiang Wang,Tao Yang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper investigates how ignoring higher-order modes (HOMs) in waveform modeling affects the measurement of orbital eccentricity for binary black hole mergers. Using Bayesian inference, they analyze six gravitational-wave events and find that HOM-induced biases in eccentricity are not statistically significant. However, they identify regimes where ignoring HOMs could lead to significant biases, namely in systems with high total mass, highly asymmetric mass ratios, near-edge-on orientations, and high signal-to-noise ratios. These findings suggest that while current eccentricity candidates are not significantly impacted, future measurements of more extreme systems require HOM-inclusive waveform models to avoid systematic errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eccentric binaries are important for gravitational-wave astronomy, but their measurement can be systematically biased if higher-order modes are neglected. Understanding these biases is crucial for accurate modeling and future detections.

Method: The study uses Bayesian inference with the SEOBNRv5EHM model, comparing results from including higher-order modes to a model that only considers dominant modes. They perform a zero-noise injection campaign to vary system parameters.

Result: HOM-induced biases in eccentricity are not statistically significant for the analyzed events. However, significant systematic biases (Δ_e/σ > 1) are found in systems with high mass, asymmetric mass ratios, near-edge-on orientations, and high SNR. For quasi-circular systems with high mass, neglecting HOMs could lead to false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. Lower-mass systems show negligible biases.

Conclusion: Current eccentricity measurements are not significantly impacted by HOM omission, but future studies of extreme systems require HOM-inclusive models to mitigate potential biases.

Abstract: We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.

TL;DR: Renormalized quantities for scalar fields in Kerr black hole interiors are computed using tailored t-splitting PMR, addressing divergent sums by intermediate subtraction, with results validated against an appendix method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending PMR for Kerr black hole interiors to handle unique divergent issues, especially near the inner horizon, using t-splitting method with intermediate divergence subtraction.

Method: Modified t-splitting PMR method with intermediate divergence subtraction tailored for Kerr interior, considering minimally-coupled massless scalar fields in Unruh state.

Result: Computed renormalized fluxes ⟨Tuu⟩, ⟨Tvv⟩ and ⟨Φ²⟩ across Kerr interior from just outside event horizon to inner horizon, with results near inner horizon matching previous work.

Conclusion: The method successfully handles Kerr black hole interior field renormalization with intermediate divergences subtracted, verified through independent computations.

Abstract: Renormalization of physical quantities for quantum field theories in curved spacetimes can be achieved via the consistent subtraction of counterterms within a regularization scheme such as a point-splitting method. Pragmatic mode-sum regularization (PMR) is a point-splitting method which is particularly suitable for rotating black hole spacetimes. We extend and tailor the t-splitting variant of PMR specifically for the interior of a Kerr black hole on the axis of rotation, focusing on a minimally-coupled massless scalar field in the physically-motivated Unruh state. The method addresses unique challenges in the black hole interior that do not occur outside. In particular, while the infinite sum over multipolar number l converges in the black hole exterior, it diverges in the interior, necessitating the subtraction of a so-called intermediate divergence which includes introducing an additional "small" split in the direction of the polar angle. This procedure is outlined and justified, along with the standard PMR method's counterterms subtraction. We apply this method to calculate the renormalized energy-momentum fluxes $\langle T_{uu}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$, $\langle T_{vv}\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ (where u and v are the standard Eddington coordinates) and the renormalized field square $\langle Φ^2\rangle^U_\text{ren}$ throughout the black hole interior, spanning from (just off) the event horizon to (just off) the inner horizon. Special emphasis is placed on the inner horizon vicinity, where our t-splitting results for the fluxes asymptote to those obtained directly at the inner horizon using a different method in a previous work. In an Appendix, we develop an alternative t-splitting PMR variant which does not include the intermediate divergence subtraction. We utilize it for independent computations that are used to verify the standard t-splitting variant presented in the main text.

Abstract: The derivation of the equations of motion for nonholonomic systems remains a central issue in analytical mechanics, primarily due to the tension between the d'Alembert-Lagrange differential principle and integral variational approaches. This study investigates the validity of the commutation relation between the variational operator and the time derivative, which is a geometric identity in holonomic manifolds but becomes problematic when dealing with velocity-dependent constraints. By analyzing the transposition rule, we define a formal relationship between the Chetaev variation and the total variation of the constraints. We show that the simultaneous requirement of kinematically admissible variations and the fulfillment of the Chetaev condition is generally incompatible with the standard commutation rule, unless a specific geometric condition - encoded through a skew-symmetric algebraic structure and the Lagrangian derivative of the constraints - is satisfied. Furthermore, this work extends the analysis to systems with multiple constraints introducing the concept of dynamic compensation. While Frobenius' Theorem provides a static criterion for integrability based on individual vector fields, our results suggest that dynamic consistency according to Chetaev's principle emerges as a collective phenomenon. We demonstrate that even when individual constraints are intrinsically non-integrable, their interactions can cancel out deviations from holonomy, maintaining global consistency. Notably, we show that for systems with high constraints this property is satisfied regardless of the constraints' form. These findings broaden the class of analyzable physical systems, suggesting that dynamic consistency is a resilient property that persists even in the absence of simple geometric integrability.

### [106] [Advanced Superdirective Antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04121)
*Alex Krasnok*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: supergain antennas achieve narrow main beams through strong coupling and near-field energy storage rather than physical size. this review covers evaluation aspects, implementation methods, and trade-offs with examples in rf, microwave, and optical regimes. emerging technologies like low-loss materials and time-varying loading show potential to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: there is a growing need to develop compact and highly directive antennas, particularly in applications requiring supergain performance, making this research relevant for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

Method: the paper reviews two implementation approaches: resonant, tightly coupled arrays and single-body radiators with multi-resonant structures. it also discusses trade-offs and emerging technologies such as low-loss materials and time-varying loading.

Result: the paper identifies key challenges such as reduced radiation resistance and narrow bandwidth, while highlighting innovative solutions in materials and operation methods.

Conclusion: this review provides a comprehensive analysis of superdirective antennas, offering insights into their potential and limitations, with a focus on practical implementation and future research directions.

Abstract: Superdirective (supergain) antennas aim to produce a narrow main beam from radiators that are electrically small compared with the wavelength. Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Finite, lossy waveguides are ubiquitous: distributed attenuation with partial reflections produces feedback, resonance, delays and decay across electromagnetic, acoustic, photonic, quantum-transport and electrochemical interfaces. Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\mathcal{U}^2-\mathcal{S}^2=|Γ_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|Γ_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|Γ_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH. This framework provides a transferable design language for dissipative, boundary-controlled systems.

Abstract: Light source is a foundational to photonic science and technology. However, a significant challenge remains in generating and distributing coherent light from a single on-chip source with high phase stability across multiple channels. Integrated lasers typically operate independently, and conventional splitters (e.g., multi-mode interferometers) do not guarantee the phase coherence required for advanced applications. Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution. This work establishes a versatile and scalable platform for integrated coherent light sources, paving the way for integrated photonic applications such as quantum photonics and optical computing.

Abstract: Ultrafast mid-infrared (MIR) imaging is a key enabling capability for monitoring transient thermal and plasma phenomena in scientific diagnostics and industrial safety. However, conventional cryogenic MIR cameras face a fundamental trade-off between frame rate, noise, and pixel format. Here we report a passive, incoherent MIR imaging platform that leverages sum-frequency upconversion in chirped periodically poled lithium niobate (CPLN) to translate broadband 3--5um scenes to the near-infrared, enabling ultrafast acquisition on a silicon-based intensified CCD (iCCD). In fast-kinetics mode we achieve a physical frame rate of 100kHz with microsecond-scale gate control, and we directly capture the full evolution of an air-breakdown electric arc, resolving its rapid ignition, expansion, and decay dynamics. Beyond demonstrating ultrafast passive imaging, we introduce a drift-aware calibration workflow based on Allan deviation analysis to quantitatively select the gate width and averaging strategy under realistic slow-drift and multiplicative noise. This combined capability -- ultrafast passive MIR imaging plus operationally meaningful calibration -- provides a practical route toward real-time thermal surveillance and early-warning systems for hazardous fast transients.

Conclusion: The results validate the effectiveness of the calibration method and reveal the importance of aberrations in holographic setups, guiding future optimizations in both image quality and diffractive efficiency through targeted aberration management.

Abstract: We use camera-in-the-loop calibration to calibrate a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) in a far-field hologram setup. The recorded intensity distributions achieve a high degree of consistency with the calculated results, indicating a precise calibration and sufficient modeling of the most prominent aberrations. In this work, we discuss the modeled aberrations and examine the improvement or loss in image quality and diffraction efficiency that is obtained by including or excluding the modeled aberrations in the calibration. We further show the influence of aberrations on speckle-reduced holograms and evaluate the speckle contrast.

Motivation: The study of quantum materials, particularly single-photon emitters, is crucial for advancing quantum computing and light-based technologies. Efficient characterization of these emitters requires reliable and automated measurement tools, which led to the development of our confocal photoluminescence system.

Method: Our method involved a confocal setup using a laser excitation and spectrometer acquisition. A double-acquisition technique was employed to eliminate cosmic ray artifacts. The system integrates motorized stages and Python-based control. It also incorporated a galvo-mirror scanning approach for low-temperature measurements.

Result: The system successfully produced temperature-dependent PL spectra and spatially resolved maps of single-photon emitters. Additionally, we automated other techniques like Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy for hyperspectral imaging, expanding its utility in quantum material studies.

Conclusion: This comprehensive system provides efficient characterization of single-photon emitters and extends quantum imaging capabilities, supporting advancements in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We present the automation of a confocal photoluminescence (PL) scanning system for the identification and characterization of single-photon emitters (SPEs) in quantum materials. The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples.

Abstract: We investigate the impact of harmonic confinement in a finite optical superlattice and reveal the different mechanisms that can lead to the emergence of localized states. The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system. We address several aspects relevant to the experimental implementation of optical superlattices and provide a brief illustration of the dynamics, highlighting direct ways to observe and distinguish between the different localization mechanisms.

Abstract: Structured light offers a promising solution for the increasing data demands of modern optical networks, opening up new degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for greater channel capacity and more bits per photon. However, its implementation is hindered by real-world distortions, for example, atmospheric turbulence in free-space, with severe and rapidly evolving phase perturbations that alter the amplitude, phase and vectorial polarization structure of the beam. Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (>98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested. Our work is the first to demonstrate the potential for optical topologies as reliable and robust information carriers in a real-world environment and points to the potential for other complex channels too, offering attractive features for classical and quantum communication alike.

Abstract: This industrial Ph.D. project, carried out in collaboration between Radiometer Medical ApS and SDU Centre for Photonics Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark, explored the use of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) for the purposes of differential white blood cell counts (dWBCs) in point-of-care (PoC) devices for acute care settings. Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV). Both prototypes employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cell classification. With further optimizations, the lensless system achieved classification accuracies of 92.65% and 89.44% on the 3-part and 5-part differential, respectively. With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.
  Additionally, pixel super-resolution and multi-wavelength DHM approaches were investigated to enhance the obtained cell information. Finally, a proof-of-principle physics-informed neural network (PINN) for holographic reconstruction was implemented, demonstrating the potential for machine learning (ML) reconstruction techniques.
  In summary, this work represents an initial exploration of DHM for dWBC in PoC devices, laying the groundwork for future research.

Abstract: High-reflective crystalline $GaAs/Al_{0.92}Ga_{0.08}As$ coatings show reduced Brownian noise compared to conventional dielectric coatings. However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power.

Abstract: Mask-based lensless imagers use simple optics and computational reconstruction to design compact form factor cameras with compressive imaging ability. However, these imagers generally suffer from poor reconstruction quality. Here, we describe several advances in both hardware and software that result in improved lensless imaging quality. First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers.
