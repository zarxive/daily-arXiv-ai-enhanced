Abstract: Few-body physics plays a central role in many branches of physics, such as nuclear physics and atomic physics. Advances in controlling ultra-cold quantum gases provide an ideal testbed for few-body physics theory. In this work, we study few-body systems consisting of two distinct species of non-relativistic fermions in one spatial dimension using both field theory and lattice methods. Particles of the same type do not interact with each other, but particles of different types can interact via an attractive contact interaction. We first study the dependence of the coupling of a contact interaction on the lattice spacing. Using this input, we extract two-, three-, and four-body ground state energies in the infinite length limit and benchmark them against the calculations from the continuum field theory. This work enables us to systematically study the effect of discretization and finite-length artifacts on few-body observables.

Abstract: The stated overarching goal of the highly active field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP) is to achieve the capability to study \textit{ab-initio} real-time microscopic dynamics of $3+1$D quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, existing experimental realizations and theoretical proposals for future ones have remained restricted to one or two spatial dimensions. Here, we take a big step towards this goal by proposing a concrete experimentally feasible scalable cold-atom quantum simulator of a U$(1)$ quantum link model of quantum electrodynamics (QED) in three spatial dimensions, employing \textit{linear gauge protection} to stabilize gauge invariance. Using tree tensor network simulations, we benchmark the performance of this quantum simulator through near- and far-from-equilibrium observables, showing excellent agreement with the ideal gauge theory. Additionally, we introduce a method for \textit{analog quantum error mitigation} that accounts for unwanted first-order tunneling processes, vastly improving agreement between quantum-simulator and ideal-gauge-theory results. Our findings pave the way towards realistic quantum simulators of $3+1$D lattice gauge theories that can probe regimes well beyond classical simulability.

Abstract: We consider a dimer formed by two particles with an attractive contact interaction in one dimension, colliding with a hard wall. We compute the scattering phase shifts and the reflection coefficients for various collision energies and various mass ratios of the two particles. For low-energy collisions (with dimer kinetic energies much smaller than the binding energy) our results are consistent with those of D. Lee and M. Pine, The European Physical Journal A 47, 41 (2011). For mass ratios much greater than 1 we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to show that the scattering length and the effective range of the dimer-wall collision both depend logarithmically on the mass ratio. For collision energies much greater than the binding energy, the dissociation probability is inversely proportional to the square of the incident momentum of the dimer and we find the constant of proportionality analytically, and we use a semiclassical analysis to approximately derive the ``angular distribution" of the dissociated pair, where the ``angle" $θ$ depends on the ratio of the velocities of the two outgoing unbound particles.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate a non-Hermitian optical dimer whose parameters are renormalized by dispersive and dissipative backaction from the coupling of the passive cavity with a ring-trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. The passive cavity is driven by a two-tone control laser, where each tone is in a coherent superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momenta $\pm \ell \hbar$. This imprints an optical lattice on the ring trap, leading to Bragg-diffracted sidemode excitations. Using an exact Schur-complement reduction of the full light-matter dynamics, we derive a frequency-dependent self-energy and identify a static regime in which the atomic response produces a complex shift of the passive optical mode. This renormalized dimer supports a tunable exceptional point, enabling spectroscopic signatures in the optical transmission due to a probe field, which can in turn be utilized for estimating the winding number of the persistent current. Exploiting the associated half-integer topological charge, we propose a digital exceptional-point-based sensing scheme based on eigenmode permutation, providing a noise-resilient method to sense superfluid rotation without relying on fragile eigenvalue splittings. Importantly, the sensing proposals are intrinsically non-destructive, preserving the coherence of the atomic superfluid.

Abstract: Periodic potentials with flat bands in their spectra support strongly localized nonlinear excitations. Although a perfectly flat band cannot exist in a continuous system, a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in a Zeeman lattice can realize the quasi-flat lowest band with an extremely narrow bandwidth. In such a quasi flat band, half vortex solitons become confined within a single lattice cell, enabling the formation of arrays of coupled half vortex solitons arranged of various spatial geometries. In this work, we study the existence and stability of these lattices within the framework of the two-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that, near the quasi-flat band, half-vortex solitons and their arrays can be excited with a nearly negligible number of atoms and are constrained by their local symmetries, which are isomorphic to a dihedral group of order 8. This allows observation of the respective field patterns in the nearly linear regime where they exhibit enhanced stability. The constructed lattices may have diverse geometric profiles, and in particular create a composite super-half-vortex soliton with nonlinear symmetry breaking.

Abstract: A dissipative time crystal is an emergent phase in driven-dissipative quantum many-body systems, characterized by sustained oscillations that break time-translation symmetry spontaneously. Here, we explore nonequilibrium phase transitions in a dissipative Rydberg system driven by a microwave (MW) field and demonstrate their critical sensitivity to high-precision MW sensing. Distinct dynamical regimes are identified, including monostable, bistable, and oscillatory phases under mean-field coupling. Unlike single-particle detection--where the beating signal decays linearly with MW field strength--the time crystalline phase exhibits high sensitivity to MW perturbations, with rapid, discontinuous frequency switching near the monostable-oscillatory boundary. The abrupt transition is rooted in spontaneous symmetry breaking in time and is fundamentally insensitive to the background noise. On this basis, a minimum detectable MW field strength on the order of 1nV/cm is achieved by leveraging this sensitivity. Our results establish a framework for controlling time crystalline phases with external fields and advance MW sensing through many-body effects.

Abstract: We explore the ground state properties and excitation spectra of one-dimensional three-component bosonic mixtures accommodating a droplet in two of the species and a third minority component. Relying on the suitable Lee-Huang-Yang framework, we reveal a plethora of distinct self-bound droplet phases and their phase transitions through variations of either the particle number of the majority components or the intercomponent coupling. The ensuing phases demonstrate that the minority component is being un-trapped, partially trapped, or fully trapped by the majority droplet species. These states are characterized by their binding energies captured by the chemical potentials and their low-amplitude excitation spectrum, including mode crossings at the particle-emission threshold. We further derive effective reduced models which are valid in the high-imbalance limit, and accurately reproduce the numerically computed ground states, while providing analytical insights into the role of quantum fluctuations. Our results map out the stability and structure of mixed droplet phases offering guidance into forthcoming experimental and theoretical studies of multicomponent quantum droplets.

### [8] [Classical solution of the FeMo-cofactor model to chemical accuracy and its implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04621)
*Huanchen Zhai,Chenghan Li,Xing Zhang,Zhendong Li,Seunghoon Lee,Garnet Kin-Lic Chan*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a classical computational approach to determine the ground-state energy of FeMo-co with chemical accuracy, similar to quantum algorithms, and discusses its implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding FeMo-co's electronic structure is crucial due to its importance in nitrogenase and its complexity as a multi-metallic center.

Method: The authors developed a classical computational method using multi-configurational reference to address the multiple configurations, aiming to estimate the ground-state energy with chemical accuracy.

Result: The study successfully performed this computation, predicting the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy, and explores its implications beyond the model.

Conclusion: This work bridges classical computation with quantum algorithms in studying FeMo-co's electronic structure, highlighting the potential of classical methods in this field.

Abstract: The main source of reduced nitrogen for living things comes from nitrogenase, which converts N2 to NH3 at the FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co). Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate.
  FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature.
  Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure.

Abstract: We present an integrated multiscale framework that combines the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) with a polarizable fluctuating-charge (FQ) force field for the simulation of electronic excited states in solution. The method exploits the capabilities of DMRG to accurately describe systems with strong static correlation, while the FQ model provides a self-consistent and physically grounded representation of solvent polarization within a QM/MM embedding. The DMRG/FQ approach is applied to representative solvated systems, using extensive molecular dynamics sampling. The method yields reliable excitation energies, solvatochromic shifts, and a close agreement with available experimental data. The results highlight the importance of mutual polarization for capturing specific solute-solvent interactions, particularly in systems where hydrogen bonding or directional interactions play a dominant role.

TL;DR: Abstract describes the analysis of brain connectomes across five species revealing that distance-dependent connectivity, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment generate key structural properties of brain networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how complex brain networks evolve across species and identifying universal principles is critical for advancing neuroscience and comparative cognition.

Method: Single-neuron resolution connectomes from C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse were analyzed. The study employs distance-dependent connectivity, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment models to replicate the observed structural properties.

Result: Incorporating these mechanisms successfully reproduces small-world networks, heavy-tailed distributions, and efficient information processing.

Conclusion: This study uncovers universal brain network assembly rules, suggesting evolutionarily conserved principles that explain complex network architectures across diverse species.

Abstract: Brain networks exhibit remarkable structural properties, including high local clustering, short path lengths, and heavy-tailed weight and degree distributions. While these features are thought to enable efficient information processing with minimal wiring costs, the fundamental principles that generate such complex network architectures across species remain unclear. Here, we analyse single-neuron resolution connectomes across five species (C. Elegans, Platynereis, Drosophila M., zebrafish and mouse) to investigate the fundamental wiring principles underlying brain network formation. We show that distance-dependent connectivity alone produces small-world networks, but fails to generate heavy-tailed distributions. By incorporating weight-preferential attachment, which arises from spatial clustering of synapses along neurites, we reproduce heavy-tailed weight distributions while maintaining small-world topology. Adding degree-preferential attachment, linked to the extent of dendritic and axonal arborization, enables the generation of heavy-tailed degree distributions. Through systematic parameter exploration, we demonstrate that the combination of distance dependence, weight-preferential attachment, and degree-preferential attachment is sufficient to reproduce all characteristic properties of empirical brain networks. Our results reveal that activity-independent geometric constraints during neural development can account for the conserved architectural principles observed across evolutionarily distant species, suggesting universal mechanisms governing neural circuit assembly.

### [11] [Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories from Symmetry Disentanglers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04304)
*Ryan Thorngren,John Preskill,Lukasz Fidkowski*

Main category: hep-th

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chiral gauge theories are fundamental in theoretical physics, but constructing them on the lattice has been challenging due to chirality.

Method: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework based on symmetry disentanglers, which are constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones.

Result: We successfully implement this framework for $U(1)$ symmetries in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions using lattice rotor models, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel.

Conclusion: This work opens a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.

Abstract: We propose a Hamiltonian framework for constructing chiral gauge theories on the lattice based on symmetry disentanglers: constant-depth circuits of local unitaries that transform not-on-site symmetries into on-site ones. When chiral symmetry can be realized not-on-site and such a disentangler exists, the symmetry can be implemented in a strictly local Hamiltonian and gauged by standard lattice methods. Using lattice rotor models, we realize this idea in 1+1 and 3+1 spacetime dimensions for $U(1)$ symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies, and show that symmetry disentanglers can be constructed when anomalies cancel. As an example, we present an exactly solvable Hamiltonian lattice model of the (1+1)-dimensional "3450" chiral gauge theory, and we argue that a related construction applies to the $U(1)$ hypercharge symmetry of the Standard Model fermions in 3+1 dimensions. Our results open a new route toward fully local, nonperturbative formulations of chiral gauge theories.

Abstract: Correlation functions of local operators in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on hyperbolic space can be fully characterized by the set of QFT data $\lbrace Δ_i,C_{ijk},b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j\rbrace$. These are the scaling dimensions of boundary operators $Δ_i$, the boundary Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients $C_{ijk}$ and the Boundary Operator Expansion (BOE) coefficients $b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j$ that characterize how each bulk operator $\hat{\mathcal{O}}$ can be expanded in terms of boundary operators $\mathcal{O}_j$.For simplicity, we focus on two dimensional QFTs and derive a universal set of first order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that encode the variation of the QFT data under an infinitesimal change of a bulk relevant coupling. In principle, our ODEs can be used to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow starting from a solvable QFT into a strongly coupled phase and to the flat space limit.

Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops is governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to solve this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze ``indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counting of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.

Abstract: Framing anomaly is a key property of $(2+1)d$ chiral topological orders, for it reveals that the chirality is an intrinsic bulk property of the system, rather than a property of the boundary between two systems. Understanding framing anomaly in lattice models is particularly interesting, as concrete, solvable lattice models of chiral topological orders are rare. In a recent work, we defined and solved the $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, showing its chiral edge mode and the associated gravitational anomaly on boundary. In this work, we show its framing anomaly in the absence of boundary, by computing the expectation of a lattice version of the modular $T$ operator in the ground subspace on a spatial torus, from which we extract that $\langle T \rangle$ has a universal phase of $-2π/12$ as expected: $-2π/8$ from the Gauss-Milgram sum of the topological spins of the ground states, and $2π/24$ from the framing anomaly; we can also extract the $2π/24$ framing anomaly phase alone from the full spectrum of $T$ in the ground subspace by computing $\langle T^m \rangle$. This pins down the last and most crucial property required for a valid lattice definition of $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory.

Abstract: Motivated by a question of defining gauge-invariant observables in cosmology and by the close connection between perturbation theory in de Sitter (dS) and Anti-de Sitter (AdS), we study scalar electrodynamics in AdS in setups that are largely unexplored but relevant for dS physics. For photons with standard (Dirichlet) boundary conditions, we analyze charged scalars whose boundary conditions break the $U(1)$ symmetry. This leads to a nonstandard Higgs mechanism in which the gauge field acquires a one-loop mass without a classical vacuum expectation value. Using recent advances in perturbation theory in AdS, we compute this mass explicitly and evaluate charged-scalar four-point functions. We also provide an alternative derivation based on boundary Ward identities. For photons with alternate (Neumann) boundary conditions, where local charged operators are not gauge invariant, we construct physical observables by dressing charged fields with geodesic Wilson lines. These dressed operators have well-behaved conformal properties and unphysical photon modes decouple from their correlation functions. Explicit one-loop computations further reveal the decoupling of boundary field strengths, for which we provide a nonperturbative argument based on higher-form symmetry. Along the way, we explain the physical consequences of spontaneous breaking of higher-form symmetry in AdS, including the role of the tilt operator, the relation between one-form symmetry and endpoints of Wilson lines at the boundary, and a generalized-symmetry interpretation of conserved currents dual to bulk gauge fields.

Abstract: In celestial holography, scattering particles in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes are dual to conformal primary field operators on the celestial sphere. Multi-particle celestial operators can be formed from regularized coincident limits of single-particle celestial operators. The singular terms in the operator product expansion of multi-particle operators are shown to be determined entirely by the singular terms in the operator product expansion between single-particle celestial operators, as expected in a standard conformal field theory. Boundary operator product expansions in celestial holography are known to be dual to subtle collinear limits of bulk scattering amplitudes. The multi-particle operator product expansions derived from standard conformal-field theoretic techniques are shown to reproduce precisely the results from the corresponding bulk collinear limits in tree-level Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity. Finally, the coefficients of multi-particle celestial operator product expansions are derived from a third complementary method that enforces bulk four-dimensional translational invariance as a global symmetry of the celestial dual. The results of all three methods agree precisely.

Abstract: It is known that, for a range of chemical potentials, the infrared behavior of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (cSYK) model is governed by a 1D Nearly Conformal Field Theory (NCFT$_{1}$), thereby realizing a continuous line of NCFTs. A finite chemical potential $μ$ introduces an asymmetry parameter $\mathscr{E}$ into the cSYK fermion two-point function in the conformal limit. In this work, we compute the cSYK four-point function in the conformal limit for an arbitrary value of $\mathscr{E}$ at leading order in $1/N$. We show that the result is fully consistent with the NCFT$_{1}$ structure of the cSYK model and use it to extract the structure constants for correlation functions of two complex fermions with bilinear operators.

Abstract: In this work, we scrutinize local gauge-invariant vector operators of dimension four in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model, which are candidates for interpolating fields of the fundamental excitations of the model due to the so-called FMS mechanism. We use the equations of motion and the properties of the BRST operator to derive a Ward identity that allows us to determine whether a given operator can propagate. To corroborate this analysis, we explicitly compute the two-point function of the non-propagating operator at the one-loop level.

The singly spinning configuration lies in the duality orbit of the black ring constructed by Elvang, Emparan, and Figueras, while the doubly spinning configuration is a charged extension of the black ring constructed by Chen, Hong, and Teo. We analyze the physical properties of these solutions and the various limits they admit. In particular, the doubly spinning solution admits an extremal limit in which the entropy satisfies the relation S= 2 πJ_φ, thereby linking it directly to the angular momentum on the S^2.

Abstract: We construct the index saddle for the supersymmetric F1--P black ring. Our construction proceeds by taking a supersymmetric limit of a non-supersymmetric doubly spinning F1--P black ring. We express the resulting saddle as a three-center Bena--Warner solution. The black ring saddle possesses a finite-area event horizon, yet the two-derivative index vanishes. The solution is singular on certain subspaces of the horizon, where higher-derivative corrections are expected to become important. We argue that, once such corrections are taken into account, the solution can yield a finite result. In particular, we present a scaling analysis showing that the index agrees with the microscopic result, up to an overall numerical constant that cannot be fixed by the scaling argument alone. This analysis applies only within a restricted region of parameter space, whose full significance is not yet fully understood.

TL;DR: We construct a four-dimensional conformal amplitude that matches the Virasoro-Shapiro form from string theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aims to provide a new perspective or realization of amplitude structures in conformal field theory, potentially bridging CFT and string theory.

Method: The method involves constructing a four-dimensional conformal amplitude using principles of CFT such as radial quantization, scale invariance, and analyticity, without relying on string theory's worldsheet geometry or degrees of freedom. Analytically, the construction depends on symmetry, consistency, and the specific form matching that from string theory.

Result: The result is a kinematical, first-quantized amplitude defined by symmetry and consistency, which represents a concrete example of a string-like analytic structure in four-dimensional conformal field theory and serves as a testable case for amplitude bootstrap methods.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel construction of a conformal amplitude that mirrors string-theoretic features, suggesting potential applications in the amplitude bootstrap approach and offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between CFT and string theory.

Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional conformal amplitude whose four-point structure matches the Virasoro-Shapiro form familiar from string theory. The construction uses only general principles of conformal field theory - radial quantization, scale invariance, and analyticity - and does not rely on worldsheet geometry or string degrees of freedom. The resulting object is a kinematical, first quantized amplitude defined by symmetry and consistency, providing a four-dimensional realization of stringlike analytic structure and a concrete target for amplitude bootstrap approaches.

Abstract: We investigate how the gravitational effects of a black hole manifest themselves as thermal behavior in the dual finite-temperature conformal field theory (CFT). In the holographic framework of AdS/CFT, we analyze a wave packet propagating into a black hole geometry in the bulk by computing three-point functions of a scalar primary operator in the boundary CFT. Our setup captures thermal signatures such as exponential damping of the expectation value, which are absent at zero-temperature. This provides a concrete and analytically tractable example of how black hole physics can be probed from the CFT side.

Abstract: We apply the conformal compensating technique for constructing matter couplings to conformal scalars on a $D$-dimensional foliated conformal Carroll manifold dividing the tangent space into $(p+1)$-dimensional longitudinal and $(D-p-1)$-dimensional transversal directions corresponding to $p$-branes. We show that the conformal Carroll algebra that was used for particle-like foliated geometries with $p=0$ cannot be used for higher-dimensional objects, called $p$-branes, with $0 < p \le D-2$. Furthermore, string-like foliated geometries are not suitable for the conformal compensating technique due to the conformal invariance in the longitudinal directions that is present for $p=1$. All other cases can be dealt with provided one uses a different conformal extension of the Carroll algebra that amounts to a conformal extension in the longitudinal directions only supplemented with an additional an-isotropic dilatation.
  By brane-duality similar results hold for foliated Galilean geometries which we present as well. Our results nicely fit in with recent work on foliated Aristotelian geometries.

Abstract: We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Taub-NUT and Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instantons, along with the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric, form a set of Euclidean metrics which can naturally be called `self-dual black holes', as they arise from self-dual slices of the most general vacuum, asymptotically flat black hole metric. These self-dual black holes are of interest for many reasons, and can famously be described through the non-linear graviton construction of twistor theory. However, the implicit nature of this twistor description obscures some features of the underlying geometry, particularly for the most general self-dual black holes. In this paper, we give a new construction of all asymptotically flat self-dual black holes based on holomorphic quadrics in flat dual twistor space, rather than the usual twistor space associated with self-duality. Remarkably, the geometry of the self-dual black holes -- including their hyperkahler structure, as well as Kerr-Schild and Gibbons-Hawking forms -- is directly encoded in the corresponding quadric. As a consequence, we obtain a previously unknown single Kerr-Schild form of the self-dual Plebanski-Demianski metric.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 论文通过详细推导，系统研究了带有规范对称性的开EFT在电势激发下的显式上行计算。重点探讨了规范对称性规范选择对影响泛函的影响，采用BRST形式架势，并验证整体影响作用下双-copy规范对称性保留单条对角复制对称性。依赖此推导，分析多个具体模型，如规范场对易里奇模型、费米子积出的自旋 daughters量子电子模型、标量场在热态下的EFT、阿贝尔霍金斯凯布尔模型在自发对称破坏下的形变与影响，以及与带有对称破坏的李白模型中对斯铎 Goldstone场影响的开系统研究。本研究明确指出，在所有情况下，影响泛函都是规范不变的，因此恒温大范围处理各种规范对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规范对称性在量子场论和粒子物理学中扮演核心角色。影响作用在规范不变系统中的研究有助于理解开放系统以及量子态与规范对称性之间的关系。当前文献中关于规范对称性规范选择及其影响法的研究还挺有限的，尤其是涉及多因素的综合解决方案。作为一个循序渐进的研究问题，这个论文填补了这一空白，深入探讨了从简单的模型出发，逐步推导影响泛函的结构和规范性质，确保其在规范对称下的不变性。

Method: 论文系统地从“在-在”连续谱出发，对多个U(1)规范理论中带有规范自由度的系统进行显式计算。通过构建双拷贝的作用，首先对带有电荷的自由度（如费米子或标量）进行积分，得到光或斯图克尔自由度的影响泛函。采用量子路径积分方法，并在此过程中实施规范固定程序。为了处理由此带来的冗余，采用了BRST形式架势，分析在如何如何条件下，单条对角复制电荷保留下，影响作用下的规范对称性保持不变。取得了关于不同规范固定选择适用性和不变性的结论。

Result: 研究表明，在规范对称性自发对称破坏的情况下，多元因素影响法的规范不变性是保持的。在各类应用场景中，影响作用不仅在规范不变时保持不变性，而且即使在状态或对称破坏相的任意选择下也是规范不变的。特别地，考虑了全局正交规范对称性的子空间行为，证实该对称性如果在整体上不变的话，在脱离影响法的情况下将会被破坏。此外，详细阐述了如何推广到不同情境，如耗散系统和拉姆模型中的斯铎 Goldstone场的影响。

Conclusion: 该论文提供了一个适用线性技术的步骤，用于研究多规范自由度系统的规范对称性规范固定。通过具体应用到过多规范对称性影响的例子，展示了所提出技术的有效性，为未来的理论推导提供了强大的工具。更重要的是，确认了影响泛函在规范对称性下的不变性，该性质对于建立规范不变的开放系统EFT至关重要。该研究方法对理解规范对称性规划在量子场论中的应用有深远意义。

Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and Stückelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for Stückelberg/Goldstone fields.

Conclusion: 该研究不仅丰富了数学物理中的Heun方程的应用，也为规范理论在研究高维黑洞等引力问题中的推进做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.

Abstract: A cat state localized in the right Rindler wedge is employed to study the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar free Quantum Field Theory. By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error function. Being the superposition of two coherent states, cat states allow for the existence of interference terms which give rise to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. As such, the present setup can be considered as an explicit realization of the results obtained by Summers-Werner.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a minimal relativistic completion of MOND in which (i) General Relativity is recovered exactly in the high-acceleration regime, while (ii) the Bekenstein--Milgrom (AQUAL) equation emerges in the low-acceleration regime, without introducing additional propagating fields beyond those already present in a right-handed gauge sector. The construction is motivated by an $E_6\times E_6$ framework in which $SU(3)_R\rightarrow SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{Y'}\rightarrow U(1)_{\rm dem}$, leaving a healthy repulsive $U(1)_{\rm dem}$ interaction whose charge is the square-root mass label. Gravity itself arises from the $SU(2)_R$ connection via a Plebanski/MacDowell--Mansouri mechanism, yielding an emergent tetrad and the Einstein--Hilbert action. MOND is implemented by an infrared (IR) metric deformation $ΔS_{\rm IR}[g]$ that is UV-vanishing (so GR is recovered) while its deep-MOND/static limit is fixed by a symmetry principle: in three spatial dimensions, the deep-MOND action is conformally invariant with a 10-parameter group isomorphic to $SO(4,1)$ (the de Sitter group). The single MOND acceleration scale is set by a de Sitter radius selected dynamically in the IR, $a_0=c^2/(ξ\,\ell_{\rm dS})$ with $ξ={ O}(1)$ fixed by matching to the static limit. MOND resides in perturbations and quasistatic systems; the homogeneous FRW background is controlled by the IR vacuum kinematics rather than an ad hoc cosmological constant.

### [30] [Could black hole thermodynamics play a role in black hole mergers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04379)
*George Ruppeiner*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores whether black hole spin parameters from gravitational wave observations align with the Davies phase transition in black hole thermodynamics, suggesting a connection between black hole properties and thermodynamic principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between black hole thermodynamics, specifically the Davies phase transition, and the observed parameters of black holes (like spin) could deepen our comprehension of black hole physics and the mechanisms responsible for black hole formation and evolution.

Method: The authors employ a thermodynamic fluctuation theory based on black hole thermodynamics (BHT) and the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model to analyze the spin parameters ($a$) of black holes resulting from binary black hole mergers. They derive conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium and fluctuation consistency to correlate observed spin values with theoretical predictions.

Result: The study finds that the observed spin values of black holes, particularly their clustering around $ar{a}=0.6869	ext{±}0.087$, can be linked to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$. By applying a thermodynamic fluctuation theory, they demonstrate that the observed spin values are consistent with a vibrational spectrum of the black hole event horizon, suggesting a direct connection between black hole thermodynamics and the spin parameters measured in gravitational wave observations.

Conclusion: This paper proposes that the observed spin values from black hole mergers are consistent with the thermodynamic framework of the Kerr black hole, particularly around the Davies phase transition point. The authors suggest that the spin parameter clustering observed could be explained by thermodynamic fluctuations within the black hole system, linking black hole physics to macroscopic thermodynamic principles.

Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers yield values for both the black hole remnant mass $M$ and it's spin $a$, with the $169$ $a$ values collected so far crowding significantly around their average $\bar{a}=0.6869\pm 0.087$. Could this crowding relate directly to the Davies phase transition point at $a=0.68125$ from black hole thermodynamics? I argue that a necessary challenge for such a connection requires a consistent application of the thermodynamic fluctuation theory that follows from black hole thermodynamics (BHT). Specifically, necessary are a correct choice of fluctuating variables, as well as thermal equilibrium between the event horizon at the Hawking temperature $\sim μK$ and the outside universe $\sim 3 K$. I show that the former requirement follows in straightforward fashion from the BHT of the Kerr model, while the later requires an accretion disk following the Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model. I construct a thermodynamic fluctuation theory meeting both these requirements. My results open the possibility that black hole mergers are based on some dynamical model (not known to me) with a limiting attractor state at the Davies point.

TL;DR: 论文分析了Fractional Holographic Dark Energy框架中后期宇宙奇点，如rip奇点，分别使用不同的宇宙标尺进行研究，得出一些关于奇点发生的条件和限制结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解宇宙演化和奇点发生机制是基本的天体物理研究方向，通过不同的标尺框架来研究奇点现象有助于深入理解宇宙的本质。

Method: 使用不同标尺的Granda-Oliveros和Hubble标尺，分别通过数学方程和数值模拟的方法对奇点的出现条件进行了分析，使用了状态方程和平方声速等方法作为验证指标。

Result: 在使用Granda-Oliveros标尺时，当Lévy指数α在1到2之间时，宇宙可以发生大rip和伪rip；而超过2时可能导致伪rip。使用Hubble标尺时，需要非线性的Q参数才能出现小rip和伪rip。

Conclusion: 宇宙奇点的出现依赖于特定的标尺和参数设置，详细条件需通过进一步的数学推导和数值模拟来验证。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the occurrence of late-time cosmological singularities, namely, the rip scenarios within the framework of interacting Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). We start our investigation with the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff, i.e., $L=(γH^{2}+δ\dot{H})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, and highlight the range of allowed $α$ (Lévy's index) values for which big, little and pseudo rip can occur. In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the occurrence of the little rip in FHDE equipped with a GO cutoff is rather contrived and requires a specific functional form of the IR cutoff $L\sim(γH^{2}+g(H))^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, which belongs to a larger class of Nojiri-Odintsov (NO) cutoffs. To extend our perspective beyond the GO cutoff, we investigate the interacting FHDE framework equipped with the Hubble cutoff, i.e., $L=H^{-1}$, in developing an ansatz-based approach to the little and pseudo-rip singularities as they fail to appear in the GO cutoff. Within this approach, we invoke the expression of the Hubble parameter, $H(t)$, which corresponds to the little and pseudo-rip, into the cosmological parameters such as the Equation of State (EoS) and Squared Sound Speed (SSS) as a function of cosmic time $t$. We produce numerical plots of these parameters in both linear and non-linear $Q$ regimes, which supplement our theoretical findings. In summary, our results highlight the occurrence of little and pseudo-rip singularities within a Hubble cutoff for a non-linear $Q$ term within the FHDE framework.

Conclusion: 量子引力修正不仅修正了宇宙热力学，还支持了热力学普适性的观点，几何热力学是有效工具来揭示时空的微观结构。

Abstract: The analysis of phase transitions in cosmological spacetimes shows that their existence requires a time-dependent apparent horizon radius, which in turn implies an equation of state different from that of a dark energy fluid. This condition is not compatible with the simultaneous fulfillment of Hayward's unified gravitational first law and the fundamental thermodynamic equation of the apparent horizon. To solve this problem, we introduce an alternative formulation in which the cosmological horizon is modeled as a quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic system. We apply this approach to the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe under quantum gravity corrections encoded by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), promote the deformation parameter to a thermodynamic variable, and obtain a consistent thermodynamic description without relying on the usual pressure-volume interpretation. Using Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), we show that fluctuations of the GUP parameter can induce phase transitions closely resembling those of black hole configurations. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the behavior of the GTD scalar curvature near the phase transition point, where we find a scaling behavior characterized by the critical exponent close to 1, independently of the dimension of the equilibrium space. This reveals that quantum gravity corrections not only modify the thermodynamic consistency of cosmological models but also strengthen the notion of thermodynamic universality across gravitational systems. Our findings confirm GTD as a powerful geometric tool to unveil the emergent thermodynamic microstructure of spacetime.

Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.

### [34] [Dynamical system approach to the spectral (in)stability of black holes under localised potential perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04892)
*T. Torres,S. R. Dolan*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies how small or strong perturbations affect the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations, such as those from compact objects or accretion disks. The authors examine this in spherically symmetric spacetimes, including Nariai and Schwarzschild, revealing smooth spectral deformations as perturbation parameters vary, with resonances moving along specific paths toward attractors influenced by nearby repellers for weak perturbations. This leads to a nonlinear instability when linear approximations break down.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability of black hole resonances is crucial for predicting gravitational wave signals and studying black hole physics under perturbations, especially from nearby objects or disks.

Method: The authors employ analytical methods, including perturbation theory and dynamical systems analysis, along with numerical verification through modeling of resonant spectra in different spacetime backgrounds.

Result: Perturbations cause predictable changes to resonant spectra. For weak perturbations, resonances shift slightly, but for strong ones, they undergo significant deformations. The interaction between attracting and repelling spectral points leads to nonlinear instability, where linearized models fail to accurately predict resonance behavior.

Conclusion: The study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the stability of black hole resonant spectra under various perturbations, highlighting the importance of nonlinear effects in determining long-term behavior. This has implications for gravitational wave astronomy and the theoretical modeling of black hole perturbations.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to improve understanding of the resonant spectra of black holes under perturbations arising from e.g. compact objects or accretion disks in their vicinity. It is known that adding a weak perturbation to the radial potential can strongly disrupt the spectrum of quasinormal modes and Regge poles of a black hole spacetime. Here we examine the effect of (weak or strong) localised delta-function perturbations on the resonant spectra of spherically-symmetric systems, to address fundamental questions around linear and non-linear spectral stability. We examine two cases: the Nariai spacetime with a Poschl-Teller potential and the Schwarzschild spacetime. We show that, in either case, the spectrum deforms in a smooth and continuous manner as the position and strength of the perturbation is varied. As the strength of the perturbation is increased, resonances migrate along trajectories in the complex plane which ultimately tend towards attracting points determined by a hard-wall scenario. However, for weak perturbations the trajectory near the unperturbed resonance is typically strongly influenced by a set of repelling points which, for perturbations far from the system, lie very close to the unperturbed resonances; hence there arises a non-linear instability (i.e. the failure of a linearised approximation). Taking a dynamical systems perspective, the sets of attracting and repelling spectral points follow their own trajectories as the position of the perturbation is varied, and these are tracked and understood.

Abstract: This work investigates the optical properties of a static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole in f(R) gravity coupled to Euler-Heisenberg(EH) nonlinear electrodynamics(NLED). By analyzing photon trajectories in this background spacetime, we show how the model parameters affect light propagation, leading to wider ranges of lensed trajectories and photon rings. We identify regions of parameter space that admit physically consistent black hole shadows, characterized by the existence of a photon sphere located outside the event horizon and a shadow formed beyond it. These viable regions expand with increasing electric charge and increasing fR0, illustrating the interplay between gravitational and electromagnetic effects. By constraining the model using Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we find that de Sitter black hole solutions remain compatible with the observational data, whereas anti-de Sitter solutions are disfavored for low electric charge and fR0 > -1. Finally, an analysis of the energy emission rate shows that higher electric charge enhances black hole evaporation, while stronger nonlinear electrodynamics effects and larger values of fR0 suppress it.

TL;DR: Boson star quantum effects are significant in regions of large spacetime curvature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum effects on compact objects like boson stars is crucial for merging quantum mechanics with general relativity.

Method: Used semiclassical gravity, spectral methods, and coherent states.

Result: Large quantum effects arise from strong spacetime curvature; quantum energy density is mostly positive, radial pressure negative; quantum fluctuations can dominate stress tensor in high curvature regions.

Conclusion: Classical boson star solutions require modification when quantum effects are included, and quantum corrections should be considered for other compact objects.

Abstract: Boson stars have been extensively studied in classical gravity, but their quantum properties remain comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we compute the quantum scalar fields and stress tensor in boson star spacetimes within the framework of semiclassical gravity. Divergences are regularized using Pauli-Villars fields, and accurate numerical results are obtained through spectral methods. Employing coherent states enables a direct comparison between the classical part of the stress tensor and the quantum fluctuation. Our results indicate that strong spacetime curvature is the primary source of large quantum effects. The renormalized quantum energy density is mostly positive but the radial pressure is negative, suggesting that classical boson star solutions require modification once quantum effects are included. Moreover, in regimes of large curvature, the quantum fluctuations can constitute a significant fraction of the total stress tensor. The methods developed here can be generalized to other compact objects and used to study their response to quantum corrections.

Abstract: The quantum-field-theoretic description for the U(1)-Goldstone boson of a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate with time-dependent contact interactions is developed beyond the acoustic approximation in accordance with Bogoliubov theory. The resulting effective action is mapped to a relativistic quantum field theory on a dispersive (or rainbow) cosmological spacetime which has a superluminal Corley-Jacobson dispersion relation. Time-dependent changes of the s-wave scattering length to quantum-simulate cosmological particle production are accompanied by a time-dependent healing length that can be interpreted as an analog Planck length in the comoving frame. Non-adiabatic transitions acquire a dispersive character, which is thoroughly discussed. The framework is applied to exponentially expanding or power-law contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetimes which are known to produce scale-invariant cosmological power spectra. The sensitivity of these scenarios to the time-dependence of the Bogoliubov dispersion is investigated: We find a violation of scale-invariance via analytically trackable Transplanckian damping effects if the cut-off scale is not well separated from the horizon-crossing scale. In case of the exponential expansion, these damping effects remarkably settle and converge to another scale-invariant plateau in the far ultraviolet regime where non-adiabatic transitions are suppressed by the high dispersion. The developed framework enables quantitative access to more drastic analog cosmological scenarios with improved predictability in the ultraviolet regime that ultimately may lead to the observation of a scale-invariant cosmological power spectrum in the laboratory.

Abstract: We present new initial data codes for constructing stationary, axisymmetric equilibrium models of differentially rotating neutron stars in full general relativity within the Frankfurt University/KADATH (FUKA) suite of initial data codes. FUKA leverages the KADATH spectral library to solve the Einstein equations under the assumption of an isentropic fluid without magnetic fields while incorporating GRHayLEOS to support 3D tabulated equations of state in \textit{stellar collapse} format. The two solvers explored in this work include one using quasi-isotropic coordinates (QIC) in Spherical coordinates while the other solves the eXtended Conformal Thin Sandwich (XCTS) decomposition in Cartesian coordinates, enabling the construction of equilibrium configurations with high accuracy and efficiency. In this work we adopt the Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu differential rotation law, however, the code is designed to be extensible to other rotation laws, allowing for exploration of physically relevant sequences and critical rotation thresholds. Furthermore, we perform convergence tests demonstrating the exponential accuracy of the spectral approach, we validate QIC and XCTS solutions against models well-studied in the literature, and we also compare FUKA solutions against the well-known RNS code. Finally, we explore the impact that initial data resolution has on dynamical simulations and recover the convergence order of the evolution scheme, the dominate source of error in this study. The new FUKA codes and results presented here lay the foundation for future extensions to more general configurations, including magnetic fields, removal of isentropic assumptions, and binary systems, and have been made publicly available to support community efforts in modeling differentially rotating relativistic stars.

Abstract: In this manuscript we generalize Ref. [1] and derive a complete set of local consistency conditions for bulk fields in braneworld scenarios with an arbitrary number of dimensions. This provides the first fully local and dimension-independent generalization of all known criteria for bulk fields. Within this framework, we show that a free scalar field is consistent and localized, whereas minimally and non-minimally coupled Maxwell fields violate the conditions, leading to a no-go theorem valid in any dimension. For nonlinear electrodynamics, we find that only the model $L(F)=b\sqrt{F}$ admits a consistent and normalizable zero mode, and that among p-forms, consistency occurs solely for the free 0-form. We also demonstrate that Dirac fermions, with or without Yukawa terms, are inconsistent within this framework and therefore cannot propagate in the bulk. Our local approach makes explicit that these conclusions do not depend on any particular internal geometry or warp factor: previously known results arise merely as special cases of a broader and strictly local structure, highlighting the universality of the constraints derived here.

Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\rm vac}=ρ_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Synergies between self-force theory and other approaches to the gravitational two-body problem have traditionally relied on calculations of gauge-invariant observables as functions of orbital frequencies. However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR:  papers introduce chaotic resetting as a strategy for accelerating deterministic chaotic systems by leveraging their sensitivity to initial conditions, unlike traditional stochastic resetting. This method requires a mixed phase space and can reduce average search times when optimized/resetting intervals are used. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: /search for ways to accelerate chaotic systems which are otherwise hard to control due to sensitivity to initial conditions. 

Method: Proposing chaotic resetting as a new method by exploiting the sensitivity of chaotic systems to reset conditions, which don't have randomness but rely instead on the system's inherent unpredictability. 

Result: Showing that chaotic resetting can be more efficient than traditional stochastic resetting in certain conditions, especially when a mixed phase space is present, and quantifying its effectiveness by reducing average search times. 

Conclusion: Establishing a bridge between deterministic chaos and optimization strategies, demonstrating that chaotic resetting can be a powerful tool for accelerating processes in chaotic systems where perfect control is impossible.

Abstract: Restarting a stochastic search process can accelerate its completion by providing an opportunity to take a more favorable path with each reset. This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable.

Motivation: Investigating the role of dipolar interactions in magnon splitting in FeF$_2$.

Method: Used very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$ to measure magnon splitting.

Result: Dipolar interactions are the dominant source of magnon splitting rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. Additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting is observed when dipolar splitting vanishes, with an estimated splitting of ~35 μeV.

Conclusion: Dipolar interactions significantly impact magnon chirality, especially when altermagnetic interactions are weak.

Abstract: FeF$_2$ is a prototypical rutile antiferromagnet recently proposed as an altermagnet, with a magnetic symmetry that permits spin-split electronic bands and chiral magnons. Using very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$, we show that the dominant source of magnon splitting is in fact the long-range dipolar interaction rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. At momenta where the dipolar splitting vanishes, we observe additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting and estimate this splitting to be $\sim$35 $μ$eV. Polarized measurements further reveal that, where dipolar splitting is present, the chiral magnon modes become mixed and the resulting modes are predominantly linearly polarized, with at most a small chiral component. These findings highlight the significant effect of dipolar interactions on magnon chirality, particularly when altermagnetic interactions are weak.

Above a critical drive strength, we find a dynamical instability, resulting from a change in sign of the magnon damping at a non-zero wavevector. The change in sign means that infinitesimal fluctuations grow with time, corresponding to an instability of the driven state. Implications for the nonequilibrium distribution function and the strong drive nonlinear dynamics are discussed.

Abstract: Spinons are elementary excitations at the core of frustrated quantum magnets. Although it is well-established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction--gauge field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.

Abstract: Quantum impurities can host exotic many-body states that serve as sensitive probes of bath correlations. However, quantitative and non-perturbative methods for determining impurity thermodynamics in such settings remain scarce. Here, we introduce an impurity renormalization group approach that merges the tensor-network representation with the numerical renormalization group cutoff scheme. This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime. We also observe an exotic evolution of the spin correlation function driven by the interplay between bath correlations and the impurity. Our results demonstrate that this method can efficiently solve correlated systems with defects, opening new pathways to discovering novel impurity physics beyond those in non-interacting thermal baths.

Abstract: Antiferromagnets have attracted significant attention because of their considerable potential in engineering high-density and ultrafast memory devices, a crucial and increasingly demanded component of contemporary high-performance information technology. Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the Néel vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \, al.$, \textcolor{blue}{\hyperlink{10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets. Thereby, the findings of current article pave the way for further theoretical and computational progress in the study of antiferromagnets for engineering spintronic devices with ultrahigh density and ultrafast speed.

TL;DR: The paper presents a full five-orbital DMFT methodology for studying spin-orbit materials, revealing that the correlation effects shift the e_g states through static mean-field corrections, and introduces hybrid-DMFT (hDMFT) for faster computations while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of computational methods in materials science is crucial for understanding complex quantum phenomena in real materials, particularly in iridates and rhodates where spin-orbit coupling plays a significant role.

Method: The paper introduces a full five-orbital DMFT approach and a hybrid-DMFT method for efficient computations. The methodology combines mean-field corrections with dynamical fluctuations.

Result: The hDMFT method enables systematic studies of temperature, doping, and pressure dependence, making it possible to investigate phenomena that were previously computationally intractable.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for advancing the theoretical understanding of high-temperature and low-dimensional strongly correlated systems and opens the door for new insights into iron and other transition metal-based materials.

Abstract: Full $d$-manifold DMFT with numerically exact solvers has remained computationally prohibitive for spin-orbit materials due their scaling and severe sign problem, forcing the community to rely on simplified one- and three-band models that omit the $e_g$ states despite their proximity with the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. We present the first full five-orbital Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) calculations including spin-orbit coupling for the layered iridates and rhodates \bio~and \bro, revealing that the correlation effects shift significantly the $e_g$ states through static mean-field corrections rather than dynamical fluctuations. Motivated by this insight, we introduce hybrid-DMFT (hDMFT), which treats these orbitals and their coupling to the low-energy manifold at the mean-field level while maintaining near quantitative accuracy at a drastically reduced computational cost. These calculation establish hDMFT as a practical and accurate method for full $d$-manifold studies of layered iridates and rhodates, enabling systematic investigations of temperature, doping and pressure dependence that were previously computationally intractable.

TL;DR: Complex magnetic behavior in Mn₂GeO₄ single crystals is regulated by a 3D exchange network of sawtooth-chain magnets, with incommensurate states traced to both third- and fourth-nearest neighbor interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding magnetic complexity in 3D exchange networks of sawtooth-chain magnets is crucial for insights into frustrated magnetism.

Method: Inelastic neutron scattering and effective Hamiltonian modeling were used to analyze the magnetic interactions and incommensurate states in Mn₂GeO₄.

Result: The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic, forming a three-dimensional network of sawtooth chains. The incommensurate states are attributed to the presence of third- and fourth-nearest neighbor interactions, as well as a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.

Conclusion: This study reveals the pivotal role of longer-range interactions in determining complex magnetic behaviors in sawtooth-chain systems, opening avenues for further theoretical exploration of similar materials.

Abstract: Sawtooth chain magnets have been a subject of historical interest in the field of frustrated magnetism, with classical olivine family $M_2TX_4$, ($M$ - 3d, $T$ - 4p, $X$ - chalcogen elements) typically realizing simple $\mathbf{k} = (000)$ states. The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains. Based on the determined strength of the couplings, the dominant sawtooth chains appear at third- and fourth- rather than next-nearest-neighbor. However the next-nearest-neighbor interaction is, along with a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, important for modeling the observed incommensurability. We use the best-fit Hamiltonian as the basis for Langevin dynamics simulations and Luttinger-Tisza calculations of the high-temperature commensurate transition.

Abstract: Van der Waals materials hosting Kitaev interactions are promising platforms for exploring exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering investigations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, which forms a honeycomb lattice structure at room temperature and exhibits zigzag-type magnetic order below 26.5 K. Our observations reveal distinctive low-energy spin excitations arising from gamma, gamma', and M' points, each featuring a spin gap of around 2.5 meV. The overall spin excitation spectra can be effectively described by a spin Hamiltonian incorporating substantial nearest-neighbor Kitaev and biquadratic interactions, along with Heisenberg interactions. Our findings not only establish VBr3 as a new Kitaev magnet but also suggest that ligand engineering may provide a promising strategy to modulate Kitaev interactions, offering new opportunities for designing Kitaev materials with tailored quantum properties.

Abstract: We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of an YbNi$_4$P$_2$ single crystal at low temperatures under magnetic fields directed along the crystallographic [001] axis. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity, which is consistent with the cascade of electronic-topological transitions reported previously for this compound. In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode. This shows how the $k$ selectivity of ultrasound experiments allows to investigate Fermi-surface reconstructions in strongly correlated electronic systems.

Conclusion: 超晶格结构提供了实际研究和理解Klein悖论的平台

Abstract: The Klein paradox describes an incoming electron being scattered at a supercritical barrier to create electron-positron pairs, a phenomenon widely discussed in textbooks. While demonstrating this phenomenon experimentally with the fundamental particles remains challenging, condensed matter analogs are more accessible to experimental realization. For spinless quasi-particles, theoretical works show an enhancement of the pair production rate, and analogs of this effect in condensed matter systems have been studied theoretically. Here, we present another condensed matter system, a heterostructure comprised of two materials with strongly and weakly interacting electrons, that allows for constructing analytical solutions using the hierarchy-of-correlations method. The results show enhanced electron reflection related with the production of doublon-holon pairs, as known from the Klein paradox.

Abstract: The surface states of a symmetry protected topological state can have many possibilities.

The first-principle calculation and the slave-rotor mean-field theory are applied to study the surface states of the relevant material system. The angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopic measurement is further suggested to detect the anomalous surface fractionalization of the chiral Abelian topological order on the surface. The connection with real materials is further discussed. We expect our results to inspire the interest in the emergent exotic and correlation physics among the cluster Mott insulating systems and in the interplay between the two different branches of topological phases.

Abstract: Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.

Abstract: NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$ is a unique example of spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice, but the presence of Na$^{1+}$/Ca$^{2+}$ $A$-site disorder complicates the local electronic and magnetic environment of the Ni$^{2+}$ $B$-site. We utilize resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to study the influence of $A$-site disorder on the $B$-site electronic structure of NaCaNi$_2$F$_7$. Ni L-edge RIXS measurements reveal a Ni$^{2+}$ electronic structure in nearly ideal octahedral coordination, with only a small trigonal compression ($δ$ = -200$\;$meV) required to capture all spectral features. Within the $D_{3d}$ symmetry of the Ni local environment, we extract an anisotropic $g$-factor of $g_{\parallel} = 2.26$ and $g_{\perp} = 2.27$, and a corresponding paramagnetic moment of $μ_{\rm{eff}}=3.2\;μ_B$. To simulate disorder, RIXS spectra were calculated with realistic distributions of crystal field parameters; however, these spectra are invariant relative to a disorder-free model, demonstrating the robustness of the Ni$^{2+}$ electronic environment to the $A$-site disorder, within the resolution of our measurement.

*Grigorii Ptitcyn,Diego M. Solís,M. S. Mirmoosa,Nader Engheta*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper discusses a method called temporal illusion, which enables the creation of effective material responses by dynamically modulating parameters in space and time. This approach allows for controlling optical phenomena as if from exotic materials while avoiding the limitations of traditional methods. It also provides ways to influence transient responses and energy accumulation. The framework is general and can be applied to various systems beyond static ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to overcome the challenges of obtaining exotic materials by providing a dynamic approach to achieve desired optical effects, expanding the possibilities in optics and wave physics.

Method: The method involves modulating the permittivity of conventional dielectric materials over time and space to mimic the properties of hypothetical exotic materials. Theoretical analysis and examples, such as controlling transient responses and energy accumulation, demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates that temporal modulation can replicate exotic material optical behaviors and control transient responses, leading to faster energy accumulation. It also suggests new applications in optics and wave physics.

Conclusion: Temporal illusion opens a new avenue for designing and controlling material responses through dynamic programming, offering both theoretical and practical advancements in optics and wave physics.

Abstract: Materials with unusual optical properties are central to advanced control of light. Yet, in nature, such materials may be exceedingly rare and often difficult to obtain. To overcome this limitation, here we introduce the concept of temporal illusion: A temporally dynamic framework in which carefully programmed temporal variations in effective parameters generate responses akin to those of, in principle, any arbitrary time-invariant structure. We theoretically demonstrate that proper modulation of the permittivity of a conventional dielectric in space and time replicates the optical behavior associated with exotic materials. Besides, we reveal that, beyond steady-state effects, temporal illusion also enables control over transient responses, for instance, by effectively lowering the time constant of high-quality-factor resonators, therefore, allowing faster energy accumulation. Moreover, by incorporating detuning between modulation and excitation, we show that the framework unlocks additional functionalities. The temporal illusion paradigm thus broadens the capabilities of space-time varying systems, offering a powerful route to synthesize material responses on demand and paving the way for new theoretical and experimental directions in optics and wave physics.

Abstract: Large-scale neural recording with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential for understanding information processing in brain, yet current neural interfaces fall far short of comprehensively capturing brain activity due to extremely high neuronal density and limited scalability. Although recent advances have miniaturized neural probes and increased channel density, fundamental design constraints still prevent dramatic scaling of simultaneously recorded channels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel electro-optic sensor that directly converts ultra-low-amplitude neural electrical signals into optical signals with high signal-to-noise ratio. By leveraging the ultra-high bandwidth and intrinsic multiplexing capability of light, this approach offers a scalable path toward massively parallel neural recording beyond the limits of traditional electrical interfaces. The sensor integrates an on-chip photonic microresonator with a graphene layer, enabling direct detection of neural signals without genetically encoded optical indicators or tissue modification, making it suitable for human translation. Neural signals are locally transduced into amplified optical modulations and transmitted through on-chip waveguides, enabling interference-free recording without bulky electromagnetic shielding. Arrays of wavelength-selective sensors can be multiplexed on a single bus waveguide using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), greatly improving scalability while maintaining a minimal footprint to reduce tissue damage. We demonstrate detection of evoked neural signals as small as 25 $μ$V with 3 dB SNR from mouse brain tissue and show multiplexed recording from 10 sensors on a single waveguide. These results establish a proof-of-concept for optically multiplexed neural recording and point toward scalable, high-density neural interfaces for neurological research and clinical applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Geometric waveguides are a promising architecture for optical see-through augmented reality displays, but their performance is severely bottlenecked by the difficulty of jointly optimizing non-sequential light transport and polarization-dependent multilayer thin-film coatings. Here we present the first end-to-end differentiable optimization framework for geometric waveguide that couples non-sequential Monte Carlo polarization ray tracing with a differentiable transfer-matrix thin-film solver. A differentiable Monte Carlo ray tracer avoids the exponential growth of deterministic ray splitting while enabling gradients backpropagation from eyebox metrics to design parameters. With memory-saving strategies, we optimize more than one thousand layer-thickness parameters and billions of non-sequential ray-surface intersections on a single multi-GPU workstation. Automated layer pruning is achieved by starting from over-parameterized stacks and driving redundant layers to zero thickness under discrete manufacturability constraints, effectively performing topology optimization to discover optimal coating structures. On a representative design, starting from random initialization within thickness bounds, our method increases light efficiency from 4.1\% to 33.5\% and improves eyebox and FoV uniformity by $\sim$17$\times$ and $\sim$11$\times$, respectively. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the waveguide and an image preprocessing network to improve perceived image quality. Our framework not only enables system-level, high-dimensional coating optimization inside the waveguide, but also expands the scope of differentiable optics for next-generation optical design.

Result: Improved resolution by factor 4.41 surpassing diffraction limit of 2.57.

Conclusion: Further algorithmic improvements are needed to reach system physical limits.

Abstract: Image Phase Alignment Super-sampling (ImPASS) is a computational method for combining displaced low-resolution images into a single high-resolution image. The general steps include measuring the relative displacements, up-sampling, aligning and combining the images, followed by a blind deconvolution. Previous ImPASS studies have shown that the resulting image resolution can significantly subceed the diffraction limit of the imaging system. Characteristics that potentially limit the processed image resolution include optical parameters, detector noise, image alignment accuracy, or deconvolution parameters. In this report, modifications have been made to the algorithm to improve the image alignment accuracy and deconvolution. Applications of the modified algorithm improved image resolution by a factor up to 1.81. Compared to the original image resolution, the modified ImPASS achieved a resolution improvement factor up to 4.41 while subceeding the diffraction limit by a factor of 2.57. This suggests that limitations imposed by the physical properties of the system have not yet been reached, and further improvement of the algorithm is warranted.

Motivation: Investigating the impact of thermal annealing on radiative heat transfer across Au/SiC interfaces to guide design and interpretation of thermal and plasmonic systems.

Method: Used fluctuational electrodynamics with experimentally measured dielectric functions of annealed and unannealed Au films to evaluate radiative heat flux.

Result: Thermal annealing significantly boosts radiative heat transfer (up to 40%) by altering plasmonic surface mode coupling.

Conclusion: Thermal annealing is a practical method to tune radiative heat transfer without modifying material properties or geometry, aiding in micro/nanostructure design.

Abstract: Thermal annealing is a widely used thin-film processing technique for modifying interfacial optical losses and electronic scattering in plasmonic materials. Here, we investigate how thermal annealing of gold thin films deposited on silicon carbide substrates influences interfacial near-field radiative heat transfer across nanoscale vacuum gaps. Using experimentally measured dielectric functions for annealed and unannealed Au films, we evaluate the spectral and total radiative heat flux between Au/SiC interfaces within a fluctuational electrodynamics framework.
  We show that annealing-induced changes in the low-frequency dielectric losses of Au significantly alter evanescent electromagnetic coupling at the interface, leading to enhancements of up to ~40\% in the total near-field radiative heat transfer at separations of tens of nanometers. Mode-resolved analysis reveals that this enhancement originates from strengthened coupling of overdamped plasmonic surface modes, which are highly sensitive to thin-film processing and interfacial microstructure. These results demonstrate that standard thermal annealing provides a practical route for tuning interfacial radiative heat transfer in metallic thin-film systems without modifying material composition or geometry, offering guidance for the design and interpretation of nanoscale thermal and plasmonic interfaces.

TL;DR: This paper presents a single-comb heterodyne spectroscopy system with improved sensitivity, resolution, and speed for time-resolved spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for high sensitivity, resolution, and speed in time-resolved spectroscopy has long been a challenge due to the fundamental trade-off between speed and sensitivity.

Method: The approach uses a single frequency comb generated by a Continuous-Wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM), with a simplified self-heterodyning architecture.

Result: The system achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2), which is an order-of-magnitude improvement over dual-comb spectroscopy, and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 128 in single-shot measurements.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables the resolution of weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, effectively resolving the core trade-off in time-resolved spectroscopy.

Abstract: Frequency comb spectroscopy has significantly advanced molecular spectroscopy across scientific research and diverse applications. Among its key performance metrics especially for time-resolved studies, sensitivity and measurement speed are paramount. However, a long-standing compromise between these parameters arises from the need for noise reduction. Here, we introduce a comb spectroscopy system that overcomes this limitation using a single frequency comb of non-uniformly spaced modes. The comb is generated using an extremely simple setup, composed of a continuous-wave (CW) fiber laser and a single-sideband phase modulator (SSM). Our approach delivers optical-to-radio-frequency conversion comparable to dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) but through a simplified self-heterodyning architecture. By leveraging the intrinsic mutual coherence of the comb, this design achieves a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient (NEA) of 5.0*10^(-6) Hz^(-1/2)--an order-of-magnitude improvement over state-of-the-art DCS, coupled with long-term stability. The system resolves weak molecular overtone spectra on nanosecond timescales, in a single-shot measurement, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 128. This integration of high sensitivity, resolution, and speed resolves the core trade-off that has long constrained time-resolved spectroscopic analysis.

Abstract: Optical-electrical-optical (OEO) converters are key primitives for low-latency, energy-efficient photonic computing because they enable nonlinear activation and optical signal regeneration on chip. We report two monolithically integrated silicon-photonic OEO converters-load-resistor (high-speed variant) and current-injection (high-gain variant) types-fabricated at a silicon photonics foundry. Each device combines a germanium photodetector with a micro-ring modulator (MRM). The converters exhibit reconfigurable nonlinear transfer functions and measurable on-chip RF OEO gain. The RF OEO gain scales linearly with the MRM bias power, with slopes of 0.10 mW^-1 (load-resistor of 10 kΩ) and 1.4 mW^-1 (current-injection), enabling a gain > 1 region at practical bias powers (~10 mW and ~1 mW, respectively). Eye diagrams confirm clear openings up to 4 Gb/s for a high-speed load-resistor variant with a 500-Ω load. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a monolithically integrated, foundry-fabricated silicon-photonic load-resistor type OEO converter exhibiting reconfigurable nonlinear transfer and on-chip RF OEO gain. In the carrier-injection device, the activation slope exceeds unity, yielding 3.9 dB extinction-ratio regeneration. Short-pulse measurements yield 3-dB bandwidths of 1.49 GHz, 160 MHz (load-resistor of 500 Ω and 10 kΩ), and 76 MHz (current-injection), consistent with the RF data. Energy analysis shows an energy-bandwidth trade-off (RC-limited for load-resistor vs. lifetime-limited for injection) and outline routes to sub-pJ/bit operation via reduced capacitance and improved EO efficiency. These results establish silicon-photonic OEO converters as compact, foundry-compatible building blocks for scalable optoelectronic computing and optical neural networks.

Motivation:  papers aim to solve the problem of low reconfigurability in conventional microwave photonic filters while maintaining their critical advantages such as high bandwidth and low loss.

Method:  papers present a novel adaptive microwave photonic filter based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source.

Result:  papers show that their proposed filter achieves sharp transition edges and high reconfigurability, suitable for advanced applications in wireless networks, radar, and medical sensing.

Conclusion:  papers provide a new solution to enhance the flexibility and performance of microwave photonic filters for future technologies.

Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) filters are essential components in microwave systems due to their wide bandwidth, low loss, and immunity to electromagnetic interference. A sharp transition band is critical for precise spectral shaping and interference suppression, yet conventional MWP filters face challenges in achieving both sharp transitions and high reconfigurability. Adaptive MWP filters with sharp transition based on a transversal filter structure using an optical microcomb source are demonstrated in this paper. Four different types of single-band MWP filters with roll-off rates up to ~32.6 dB/GHz and a minimum shape factor of ~1.15 are achieved. In addition, simply through designing tap coefficients, band-pass filters with tunable centre frequencies ranging from 5 GHz to 15 GHz and dual-band MWP filters with various filter response are demonstrated without changing any hardware, where sharp transition is also validated. The adaptive filters with sharp transition presented in this paper offer a stable and highly reconfigurable solution for applications requiring stringent spectral selectivity, such as next-generation wireless networks, high-resolution radar imaging, and advanced biomedical photonic sensing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffractive neural networks have recently emerged as a promising framework for all-optical computing. However, these networks are typically trained for a single task, limiting their potential adoption in systems requiring multiple functionalities. Existing approaches to achieving multi-task functionality either modify the mechanical configuration of the network per task or use a different illumination wavelength or polarization state for each task. In this work, we propose a new control mechanism, which is based on the illumination's angular spectrum. Specifically, we shape the illumination using an amplitude mask that selectively controls its angular spectrum. We employ different illumination masks for achieving different network functionalities, so that the mask serves as a unique task encoder. Interestingly, we show that effective control can be achieved over a very narrow angular range, within the paraxial regime. We numerically illustrate the proposed approach by training a single diffractive network to perform multiple image-to-image translation tasks. In particular, we demonstrate translating handwritten digits into typeset digits of different values, and translating handwritten English letters into typeset numbers and typeset Greek letters, where the type of the output is determined by the illumination's angular components. As we show, the proposed framework can work under different coherence conditions, and can be combined with existing control strategies, such as different wavelengths. Our results establish the illumination angular spectrum as a powerful degree of freedom for controlling diffractive networks, enabling a scalable and versatile framework for multi-task all-optical computing.

Motivation: addressing limitations in 2P microscopy, such as photo damage and low lateral resolution, to enable better imaging in biological samples.

Method: combines widefield speckled illumination with standard deviation matching for microscopy

Result: 2P-RIM achieves low excitation intensity, extended image acquisition rates, and improved resolution over large fields.

Conclusion: Presents a practical solution for enhancing 2P microscopy effectiveness in complex biological settings.

Abstract: Biological and biomedical samples are routinely examined using focused two-photon (2P) fluorescence microscopy due to its intrinsic axial sectioning and reduced out-of-focus bleaching. However, 2P imaging often requires excitation intensities that can damage samples through ionization and radical formation. Additionally, the lateral resolution of 2P microscopy is lower compared to linear one-photon (1P) fluorescence microscopy. Widefield 2P microscopy, using cameras, holds promise for reducing photo-toxicity while maintaining high image acquisition rates. Widefield imaging trades the high power and short integration times of sequential single point scanning for the low power and extended integration times of parallel detection across millions of pixels. However, generating effective axial sectioning over arbitrarily large fields of view (FOVs) has remained a challenge. In this work, we introduce 2P Random Illumination Microscopy (2P-RIM), an easy-to-implement 2P widefield technique, that achieves low photo-damage, fast imaging, micrometric axial sectioning, and enhanced lateral resolution for arbitrarily large FOVs. By using widefield speckled illuminations in conjunction with an image standard deviation matching algorithm, 2P-RIM demonstrated multicolor imaging over FOVs greater than 200 um, lateral resolution 220 nm, axial sectioning 2 um, and peak excitation powers about 10 times lower than those used in focused laser scanning microscopy.

Abstract: Structured optical materials provide a promising platform for photonic quantum information processing in free space. Beam splitters, a fundamental building block of photonic circuits, have recently been demonstrated in free space using geometric-phase optical elements. These devices coherently mix circularly-polarized transverse modes of freely-propagating optical fields, including modes carrying orbital angular momentum. In this work, we investigate liquid-crystal metagratings as electrically tunable beam splitters for transverse-momentum optical modes. By exploiting the voltage-controlled birefringence of liquid-crystal metasurfaces, we experimentally tune the splitting ratio of the device and thereby control the degree of two-photon interference between indistinguishable photons. At the output, photons are spatially resolved on different regions of a time-resolved single-photon-sensitive detector, enabling the reconstruction of coincidence maps in the Fourier plane. This approach is readily scalable and enables highly parallel coincidence measurements across a large number of optical modes.

Abstract: Conventional infrared (IR) imaging techniques depend on IR cameras based on narrow-bandgap semiconductors, which offer limited spectral bandwidth, coupled with a separate lens. Recently, advances in nonlinear flat optics have opened a novel pathway for converting IR signals into the visible through nonlinear generations, enabling the direct visualisation of IR images using standard visible cameras. However, the narrow spectral bandwidth and the requirement for an additional lens remain the key challenges. Here, we address both issues via a novel adaptive and multifunctional IR-to-visible imaging platform offering tunable bandwidth and focusing simultaneously. We utilise sum-frequency generation (SFG) to convert IR light into the visible, by introducing a pump beam modulated by a spatial light modulator (SLM) to construct a virtual metalens enabling precisely controlled focusing of the generated nonlinear optical field. As a result, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally an optical focusing mechanism with a tunable focal length, achieved by varying the pump and signal wavelengths and modulating the phase distribution. Furthermore, since the focal length depends on the input signal wavelength, the imaging plane position varies accordingly, indicating a promising potential for the multispectral IR imaging applications. Our upconversion platform delivers SLM-controlled, programmable multispectral focusing for next-generation IR imaging, opening new avenues in the fields of computational and multispectral imaging techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study near-field radiative transfer of energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum between a nanoparticle and a plate consisting of magnetic Weyl semimetals, and demonstrate that these can be efficiently tuned by a relative angle between the Weyl node separations. This tunability originates from the coupling between the particle-induced rotational Poynting vector and the nonreciprocal surface plasmon polaritons supported by the plate. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive regime in which both energy and angular momentum transfer are maximized when the Weyl node separations are antiparallel rather than parallel. This arises from optimal mode matching between the rotation direction of the particle's circular heat flux and the propagation direction of the surface plasmon polaritons in the antiparallel configuration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need for more reliable and affordable alternatives to ultra-black materials like Vantablack, which are expensive and fragile.

Method: The research employs a gonimetric measurement system to capture the reflectance distribution of different black materials, including Vantablack, black velvet, and black coatings. It evaluates their diffuse and specular scattering properties and compares their visual appearance using physically based rendering and psychophysical testing.

Result: The results highlight materials with superior light attenuation, balanced reflectance properties, and reliable performance across varying angles, helping to guide informed material selection for optical systems.

Conclusion: The study bridges reflectance measurements with visual and performance assessments, providing a framework for choosing effective black materials for optical applications.

Abstract: Black materials play a critical role in applications such as image registration, camera calibration, stray light suppression, and visual design. Although many such materials appear similarly dark under diffuse illumination, their reflectance behavior can differ substantially as a function of viewing and lighting geometry. Ultra-black materials achieve exceptional light attenuation but are often constrained by cost and mechanical fragility, motivating the evaluation of more robust and accessible alternatives. In this study, we employ a gonimetric measurement system to capture the isotropic bidirectional reflectance distribution function of a range of black materials, including the ultra-black reference Vantablack, commercially available alternatives such as Musou Black and black velvet, and standard matte black coatings. We analyze their reflectance characteristics in terms of diffuse and specular scattering, as well as total integrated scatter, to quantify angular-dependent reflection. In addition, we compare their perceptual appearance using physically based rendering driven by the measured BRDFs and a psychophysical evaluation of perceived darkness. Together, these analyses provide a comprehensive assessment of black materials that links reflectance properties to visual appearance and perceptual performance, enabling informed material selection for optical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems in optics and their relevance to analog gravity, particularly in understanding entropy production mechanisms in Hawking radiation.

Method: Using spectral partitioning of optical fields into solitonic and radiative subsystems, analyzed through the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation with higher-order dispersion.

Result: Demonstration that radiation emission via soliton breakup produces entropy, with numerical simulations supporting a generalized second law of thermodynamics.

Conclusion: Optical event horizons serve as valid nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, paving the way for studying analog gravity and information theory in labs.

Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.

*Roger Proksch*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Force distance curves (FCs) are key measurements in AFM, but their analysis is often simplified. A new method using interferometry captures dynamic oscillations in real-time, revealing local stiffness and dissipation without traditional averaging. This approach enhances resolution and detects diverse interaction behaviors that were previously overlooked.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for measuring surface properties at the nanoscale. However, the traditional analysis of force-distance curves (FCs) often reduces their information content due to filtering and quasi-static interpretations. This limits the ability to capture dynamic and transient mechanical behaviors. The development of a new interferometric detector offers a fresh approach to utilize the full potential of FCs by capturing fast, transient oscillations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of local mechanical properties.

Method: This study introduces an interferometric detector that captures fast FCs, enabling the observation of short-lived cantilever oscillations. The transient frequency and decay of these oscillations encode local stiffness and dissipation. A state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model is developed to interpret these dynamics, accounting for snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness. The method processes single-pixel, single-curve data without the need for external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging.

Result: The experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force- curve data, combined with numerical simulations, demonstrates that a single FC can contain multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes. By accessing these transient dynamics, the method achieves high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast. This approach reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are often lost under conventional averaging or detection schemes with higher noise floors.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant advance in AFM by leveraging the inherent dynamics of FCs. The ability to capture and analyze transient mechanical behaviors opens up new possibilities in surface characterization, particularly for heterogeneous and dynamic systems where conventional methods fall short.

Abstract: Force distance curves (FCs) are among the most direct measurements performed in atomic force microscopy (AFM), yet their information content is often reduced by filtering and quasi-static interpretation. Here, enabled by a new interferometric detector, we show that fast FCs inherently excite short-lived cantilever oscillations whose transient frequency and decay encode local stiffness and dissipation. By analyzing these dynamics on a single-curve, single-pixel basis, we extract time-local mechanical information without external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging. We develop a state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model that captures snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness during fast force mapping. Experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force-curve data and numerical simulations demonstrate that multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes occur within a single FC. Accessing these transient dynamics enables high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast and reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are lost under conventional averaging or with conventional detection schemes with higher noise floors.

We first elucidate the geometric origin of equilibrium magnetization in the modern theory of magnetization, then discuss the role of quantum geometry in kinetic magnetization, and finally outline promising future directions at the frontier of quantum geometric magnetization.

TL;DR: This paper discusses a magnon-based route for ultra-fast transport and non-destructive readout of spin-based information transfer in antiferromagnetic heterostructures, leveraging the anisotropic spin transport mechanism induced by the coexistence of ferroelectricity and alternagnetism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to explore new methods of controlling and manipulating spin-based information in antiferromagnetic materials, which is crucial for the development of spintronic devices and information storage systems.

Method: The authors experimentally investigated BiFeO3 layers confined between LaFeO3 layers, analyzing the magnon transport properties under electric field application and non-zero temperatures. They utilized techniques such as magnetoresistance measurements and magnon resonance spectroscopy to study the effective spin transport and the emergence of anisotropic spin textures.

Result: The key findings include the demonstration of efficient magnon transmission through BiFeO3 layers, which acts as a spin transport channel. The application of electric fields induces anisotropic spin textures, as evidenced by the magnon resonance spectra and spin-current measurements. Additionally, the suppression of the spin cycloid in BiFeO3 under confinement stabilizes a symmetry-protected antiferromagnetic state with non-trivial spin-split Dirac cones, leading to a characteristic spin-current inversion (spin-mixing effect). These results suggest a pathway for controlling spin transport in antiferromagnetic heterostructures using electric fields.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this work establishes a new route for spin-based spintronic devices by demonstrating how to achieve ultra-fast magnon transport, non-destructive spin information transfer, and electric-field-controlled spin-current inversion. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between ferroelectricity, alternagnetism, and spin transport, paving the way for future spintronic applications. The presented work lays the foundation for designing highly efficient spinmagnonic devices that exploit these phenomena.

Abstract: Magnons provide a route to ultra-fast transport and non-destructive readout of spin-based information transfer. Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field. This allows us to manipulate and amplify the spin transport in such a confined geometry. Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet. This work provides an understanding of the anisotropic spin transport in complex antiferromagnetic heterostructures where ferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist, paving the way for a new route to realize electric-field control of a novel state of magnetism.

Abstract: Proximity-induced superconductivity at topological insulator-superconductor (TI-SC) interfaces offers a promising route to topological superconductivity with Majorana boundary modes. However, probing the interfacial superconductivity at buried interfaces is challenging with conventional surface methods. Here, we present a theoretical study of the longitudinal optical response of a TI-SC heterostructure, focusing on the complex interface sheet conductance as a direct and layer-selective probe of the interfacial superconducting gap. Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state. Our results propose terahertz/infrared spectroscopy of the interfacial sheet conductance as a non-invasive diagnostic of Majorana-hosting TI--SC interfaces.

Abstract: Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.

Abstract: In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\cal P}{\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs. We show that the intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current reverses sign upon Néel vector reversal, establishing it as a direct probe of antiferromagnetic order in CuMnAs and other $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets.

Abstract: We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \pm \hbarω$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters. This highlights the potential of laser-driven MoS$_2$ structures for highly sensitive electromagnetic sensors and advanced optoelectronic devices.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate quantum spin transfer from spin-correlated conduction-electron pairs to localized spins in a ferromagnet, given that electrons are correlated intrinsically. We show that even spin-singlet pairs and triplet pairs with $m=0$, both carrying no net spin, can transfer finite angular momentum through the quantum fluctuation term inherent to the $sd$ exchange interaction. The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent. However, in partially coherent systems, like superconductor/ferromagnet junctions, coherent spin-singlet currents can directly convert into equal-spin triplet currents in generic ferromagnets, without requiring magnetic inhomogeniety or spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a fundamental spectral dichotomy absent in Hermitian physics: the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenstate spectrum can deviate significantly in the thermodynamic limit. We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect. These results establish the limitation of the eigenvalue spectrum and suggest how the eigenstate approach can lead to improved characterization of non-Hermitian topology.

Abstract: False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.

Abstract: We present a novel protocol to detect rare signals in a noisy environment using quantum error correction (QEC). The key feature of our protocol is the discrimination between signal and noise through distinct higher-order correlations, realized by the non-linear processing that occurs during syndrome extraction in QEC. In this scheme, QEC has two effects: First, it sacrifices part of the signal $ε$ by recording a reduced, stochastic, logical phase $φ_L = \mathcal{O}(ε^3)$. Second, it corrects the physical noise and extends the (logical) coherence time for signal acquisition. For rare signals occurring at random times in the presence of local Markovian noise, we explicitly demonstrate an improved sensitivity of our approach over more conventional sensing strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum systems interacting with environments are prevalent in chemistry, physics, and reservoir engineering. Accurately modeling their dynamics, especially with external influences, is crucial.

Method: The authors propose a new PILD method that avoids evaluating non-Markovian memory kernels directly, enabling application to systems with time-dependent fields and Floquet systems.

Result: The method extends PILD to account for time-dependent external fields and Floquet systems, providing a simplified yet effective approach for such complex systems.

Conclusion: This advancement broadens the applicability of PILD, enhancing its utility in studying quantum systems under dynamic and fluctuating conditions.

Abstract: The path integral Lindblad dynamics (PILD) method [A. Bose, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 15(12), 3363-3368 (2024)] had been introduced as a way of incorporating the impact of certain empirical processes like pumps and drains on the dynamics of quantum systems interacting with thermal environments. The method being based on the time-translational invariance of the Nakajima-Zwanzig memory kernel, however, was not able to account for time-dependent external fields. In this communication, we give an alternate, simpler formulation of PILD, that allows us to go beyond this limitation. It does not require the evaluation of the non-Markovian memory kernel directly, and consequently can be applied to Floquet systems as well.

Abstract: Entangled many-body states enable high-precision quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.

Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) to solve the nonlinear one-dimensional Bratu equation. By formulating the boundary value problem within a variational framework and encoding the solution in a parameterized quantum neural network (QNN), the problem reduces to an optimization task over quantum circuit parameters. The trial solution incorporates both classical approximations and boundary-enforcing terms, allowing the circuit to focus on minimizing the residual of the differential operator. Using a noiseless quantum simulator, we demonstrate that the method accurately captures both solution branches of the Bratu equation and shows excellent agreement with classical pseudo arc-length continuation results.

Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) is the standard interface to quantum annealers, yet a single constrained task admits many QUBO encodings whose penalty choices reshape the energy landscape experienced by hardware. We study a Job Shop Scheduling instance using a two-parameter family of encodings controlled by penalty weights $p_{\rm sum}$ (one-hot/sum constraints) and $p_{\rm pair}$ (precedence constraints). Sweeping $(p_{\rm sum},p_{\rm pair})$, we observe sharp transitions in feasibility and solver success across classical annealing-inspired heuristics and on a D-Wave Advantage processor. Going beyond solution probability, we treat the annealer as an open thermodynamic system and perform cyclic reverse-annealing experiments initialized from thermal samples, measuring the stochastic processor energy change. From the first two moments of this energy change we infer lower bounds on entropy production, work, and exchanged heat via thermodynamic uncertainty relations, and corroborate the observed trends with adiabatic master equation simulations. We find that the same encoding transitions that govern computational hardness also reorganize dissipation: weak penalties generate low-energy infeasible manifolds, while overly strong penalties suppress the effective problem energy scale and increase irreversibility, reducing the thermodynamic efficiency. Our results establish QUBO penalties as thermodynamic control knobs and motivate thermodynamics-aware encoding strategies for noisy intermediate-scale quantum annealers.

Abstract: We show that the Schur complement of the nodal admittance matrix, which reduces a multiport electromagnetic environment to the driving-point admittance $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$ at the Josephson junction, naturally leads to an eigenvalue-dependent boundary condition determining the dressed mode spectrum. This identification provides a four-step quantization procedure: (i) compute or measure $Y_{\mathrm{in}}(s)$, (ii) solve the boundary condition $sY_{\mathrm{in}}(s) + 1/L_J = 0$ for dressed frequencies, (iii) synthesize an equivalent passive network, (iv) quantize with the full cosine nonlinearity retained. Within passive lumped-element circuit theory, we prove that junction participation decays as, we prove that junction participation decays as $O(ω_n^{-1})$ at high frequencies when the junction port has finite shunt capacitance, ensuring ultraviolet convergence of perturbative sums without imposed cutoffs. The standard circuit QED parameters, coupling strength $g$, anharmonicity $α$, and dispersive shift $χ$, emerge as controlled limits with explicit validity conditions.

TL;DR: A bright single quantum dot in a nanowire waveguide is proposed for generating on-demand entangled photons, offering advantages in directional emission, broad bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency. However, the system faces challenges due to poor single-photon indistinguishability, which is addressed by implementing a high-Purcell cavity. The proposed design achieves a 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of approximately 17. The cavity supports a directional far-field emission profile with 88% Gaussian overlap and a light extraction efficiency of approximately 74%. This solution paves the way for enhanced entangled photon generation in practical quantum networks.

Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to overcome the limitations of quantum dot-based entangled photon sources, particularly their poor single-photon indistinguishability, and to enable more efficient and practical entangled photon generation for quantum networking applications.

Method: The researchers employ a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum, resulting from the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. The design is numerically simulated to predict a cavity mode with a 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of approximately 17. The light extraction efficiency and directional emission profile are also predicted.

Result: The proposed design successfully predicts a cavity mode with a 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of approximately 17. Additionally, the directional far-field emission profile has an 88% overlap with a Gaussian, and the light extraction efficiency is approximately 74%.

Conclusion: The study presents a feasible solution for generating high-quality entangled photon pairs with enhanced properties for quantum networks, demonstrating the potential of using nanowire cavities in such applications.

Abstract: A bright source of on-demand entangled photons is needed for quantum networks. A single quantum dot in a site-selected nanowire waveguide is a promising candidate for realizing such sources. However, such sources are associated with poor single-photon indistinguishability, limiting their applicability in quantum networks. A common approach for enhancing the single-photon indistinguishability in quantum dot-based entangled photon sources is to implement a broadband optical cavity. Achieving a high-Purcell cavity while retaining the advantages of the nanowire, such as directional emission, a broad operational bandwidth, and high light extraction efficiency, has been a significant challenge. Here, we propose a nanowire cavity based on quasi-bound states in the continuum formed by the strong coupling of two resonant optical modes. We numerically predict this design to support a cavity mode with 4 nm bandwidth and a Purcell enhancement of $\sim$17. This cavity mode enables a directional far-field emission profile (88% overlap with a Gaussian) with a light extraction efficiency of $\sim$74%. Our solution opens up a route for generating entangled photon pairs with enhanced extraction efficiency and single-photon indistinguishability for the practical realization of quantum networks.

Abstract: We introduce a momentum-space entanglement entropy to quantify quantum correlations between distinct momentum modes following a quench. We prove analytically in the transverse-field Ising (TFI) model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain that every critical momentum $k^{*}$ associated with a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) saturates its entanglement entropy to the maximal value $\ln{d}$ ($d=2$ in TFI and SSH models), coinciding with the vanishing of the Loschmidt echo. This saturation of mode entanglement thus provides a universal, direct signature of DQPTs. Our work thus establishes a unified, entanglement-based perspective on dynamical quantum phase transitions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to reduce the number of required copies for quantum state tomography, which is essential for advancing quantum computing and information processing.

Method: The algorithm employs nonadaptive Pauli measurements, which are simple and can be executed in parallel, making the process more efficient.

Result: The copy complexity of the algorithm improves upon the previous best by a factor of roughly 3/2, marking a significant advancement in the efficiency of quantum state estimation.

Conclusion: This breakthrough opens new possibilities for more practical and scalable quantum state tomography techniques.

Abstract: We give an algorithm for pure state tomography with near-optimal copy complexity using single-qubit measurements. Specifically, given $\widetilde{O}(2^n/ε)$ copies of an unknown pure $n$-qubit state $\lvertψ\rangle$, the algorithm performs only \textit{nonadaptive Pauli measurements}, runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(2^n,1/ε)$, and outputs $\lvert \widehatψ \rangle$ that has fidelity $1-ε$ with $\lvert ψ\rangle$ with high probability. This improves upon the previous best copy complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(3^n/ε)$.

Abstract: We re-visit the pentagon holographic quantum error correcting code from a ZX-calculus perspective. By expressing the underlying tensors as ZX-diagrams, we study the stabiliser structure of the code via Pauli webs. In addition, we obtain a diagrammatic understanding of its logical operators, encoding isometries, Rényi entropy and toy models of black holes/wormholes. Then, motivated by the pentagon holographic code's ZX-diagram, we introduce a family of codes constructed from ZX-diagrams on its dual hyperbolic tessellations and study their logical error rates using belief propagation decoders.

Abstract: Chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) enables spin selectivity of charge carriers in chiral molecular systems without magnetic materials. While spin selectivity has been widely investigated, its quantum coherence has not yet been explored. Here, we investigate spin-dependent photoluminescence (PL) dynamics in multilayer quantum-dot (QD) assemblies coupled by chiral linkers. Using circularly polarized excitation in the presence of an external magnetic field, we observe a pronounced modulation of the PL lifetime that depends on the magnetic field magnitude and geometry. The lifetime difference between left- and right-circularly polarized excitations exhibits a field-angle dependence, consistent with spin precession driven by the transverse magnetic-field component relative to the chiral axis. A model incorporating coupled spin precession and decay processes reproduces the experimental trends. These results establish chiral QD assemblies as a room-temperature platform for probing quantum coherent manifestations of the CISS effect, with implications for spintronic and quantum technologies.

Abstract: Using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, a secret key is created between two distant users (transmitter and receiver) at a particular key rate. Quantum technology can facilitate secure communication for cryptographic applications, combining QKD with one-time-pad (OTP) encryption. In order to ensure the continuous operation of QKD in real-world networks, efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the use of components and effective QKD protocols to improve secret key rates and increase the transmission between multiple users. Generally, in experimental implementations, the secret key rates are limited by single-photon detectors, which are used at the receivers of QKD and create a bottleneck due to their limited detection rates (detectors with low detection efficiency and high detector dead-time). We experimentally show that secret key rates can be increased by combining the time-bin information of two such detectors on the data line of the receiver for the coherent-one-way (COW) QKD protocol with a minimal increase in quantum bit error rate (QBER, the proportion of erroneous bits). Further, we implement a point-to-multipoint COW QKD protocol, introducing an additional receiver module. The three users (one transmitter and two receivers) share the secret key in post-processing, relying on OTP encryption. Typically, the dual-receiver extension can improve the combined secret key rates of the system; however, one has to optimise the experimental parameters to achieve this within security margins. These methods are general and can be applied to any implementation of the COW protocol.

### [99] [Observation of ΔJ=0 Rotational Excitation in Dense Hydrogens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04549)
*Jie Feng,XiaoDi Liu,Haian Xu,Pu Wang,Graeme J. Ackland,Eugene Gregoryanz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper examines the ΔJ=0 rotational excitation in dense H2, D2, and H2+D2 using Raman measurements across a range of pressure and temperature conditions. The study reveals that in the gas/fluid state, this excitation has a zero Raman shift, but in the solid state, a significant shift is observed (e.g., ~75 cm⁻¹ at around 50 GPa and 10 K). For deuterium, the ΔJ=0 mode shows splitting upon entering phase II, indicating a complex molecular environment in the broken symmetry phase (BSP). In the fluid state and phases I and II, the frequencies of the ΔJ=0 transition for H2 and D2 do not scale as rotational (by a factor of 2) nor vibrational (by square 2) modes and are completely isotope independent, marking this transition as unique and fundamentally different from harmonic oscillator and quantum rotor behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of rotational excitations in different states (gas, solid) and isotopes helps elucidate the underlying molecular interactions and vibrational modes, which is crucial for fields like quantum mechanics and materials science.

Method: Raman measurements were performed on dense H2, D2, and H2+D2 samples across a wide pressure-temperature range. This approach allowed the observation of rotational excitation shifts and their dependence on phase and isotopic composition.

Result: The study found that the ΔJ=0 excitation exhibits unique properties in solids, with a significant shift compared to gases. For deuterium, the ΔJ=0 mode splits in phase II, indicating a complex molecular environment. The frequencies of the ΔJ=0 transition in various states are isotope independent, unlike typical rotational and vibrational modes, highlighting the distinct nature of this excitation.

Conclusion: This research contributes to the understanding of rotational excitation behavior in solids and the effects of isotopes on molecular vibrations, offering insights valuable for both theoretical and applied physics.

Abstract: Raman measurements performed on dense H2, D2 and H2+D2 in a wide pressure-temperature range reveal the presence of the ΔJ=0 rotational excitation. In the gas/fluid state this excitation has zero Raman shift, but in the solid, the crystal field drive s it away from the zero value e.g. 75 cm-1 at around 50 GPa and 10 K for both isotopes and their mixture. In the case of deuterium, the ΔJ=0 mode splits upon entering phase II suggesting a very complex molecular environment of the broken symmetry phase (BSP). In the fluid state and phases I and II the frequencies (energies) of the ΔJ=0 transition for H2 and D2 do not scale either as rotational (by factor of 2) nor vibrational (by square 2) modes and appear to be completely isotope independent. This independence on mass marks this transition as unique and a fundamentally different type of excitation from the commonly considered harmonic oscillator and quantum rotor.

Abstract: Trapped ions naturally host multiple motional modes alongside long-lived spin qubits, providing a scalable multimode bosonic register. Efficiently characterizing such bosonic registers requires the ability to access many motional modes with limited spin resources. Here we introduce a single-spin, multimode measurement primitive using dispersive shifts in the far-detuned multimode Jaynes-Cummings interaction. We implement a Ramsey sequence that maps phonon-number-dependent phases onto the spin, thereby realizing a multimode spin-dependent rotation (SDR). We also introduce a selective-decoupling scheme that cancels the phase induced by the carrier AC-Stark shift while preserving the phonon-number-dependent phase induced by the dispersive shift. Using this SDR-based Ramsey sequence on a single trapped ion, we experimentally extract two-mode Fock-state distributions, perform parity-based filtering of two-mode motional states, and realize a nondestructive single-shot measurement of a single-mode Fock state via repeated filtering steps.

Abstract: Nonlocality can be studied through different approaches, such as Bell's inequalities, and it can be found in numerous quantum states, including GHZ states or graph states. Hardy's paradox, or Hardy-type nonlocality, provides a way to investigate nonlocality for entangled states of particles without using inequalities. Previous studies of Hardy's nonlocality have mostly focused on the fully entangled systems, while other entanglement configurations remain less explored. In this work, the system under investigation consists of four particles arranged in a cyclic entanglement configuration, where each particle forms entangled pairs with two neighbors, while non-neighboring particles remain unentangled. We found that this entanglement structure offers a larger set of conditions that lead to the contradiction with the LHV model, compared to the fully entangled systems. This enhancement can be attributed to the presence of multiple excluded states and correlations, in which the measurement result of a particle only influences the result of its paired partners. We implement quantum circuits compatible with the cyclic entanglement structure, and through simulation, the correlation patterns and the states of interest are identified. We further execute the proposed circuits on IBM Brisbane, a practical backend; however, the results show considerable deviations from the simulation counterparts.

Abstract: The efficient interfacing of quantum emitters and photons is fundamental to quantum networking. Quantum defects embedded in integrated nanophotonic circuits are promising for such applications due to the deterministic light-matter interactions of high-cooperativity ($C>1$) cavity quantum electrodynamics and potential for scalable integration with active photonic processing. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers embedded in diamond nanophotonic cavities are a leading approach due to their excellent optical and spin coherence, however their long-term scalability is limited by the diamond itself, as its suspended geometry and weak nonlinearity necessitates coupling to a second processing chip. Here we realize the first high-cooperativity coupling of quantum defects to hybrid-integrated nanophotonics in a scalable, planar platform. We integrate more than 600 gallium phosphide (GaP) nanophotonic cavities on a diamond substrate with near-surface SiV centers. We examine a particular device with two strongly coupled SiV centers in detail, confirming above-unity cooperativity via multiple independent measurements. Application of an external magnetic field via a permanent magnet enables optical resolution of the SiV spin transitions from which we determine a spin-relaxation time $T_1>0.4$ ms at 4 K. We utilize the high cooperativity coupling to observe spin-dependent transmission switching and the quantum jumps of the SiV spin via single-shot readout. These results, coupled with GaP's strong nonlinear properties, establish GaP-on-diamond as a scalable planar platform for quantum network applications.

Motivation: With the growing importance of quantum computing, reducing errors and crosstalk in quantum circuits is crucial for achieving reliable and accurate computations.

Method: The method involves using coupling-strengthened, faster two-qubit gates with a tailored scheduling strategy to reduce crosstalk in the design phase, followed by optimization with a systematic evaluation pipeline that considers composite noise models.

Result: The resulting system, SurgeQ, has demonstrated significantly higher program fidelity compared to existing benchmarks, achieving a million-fold improvement in large-scale circuits.

Conclusion: By integrating hardware and software co-design, SurgeQ effectively addresses the critical challenge of gate errors and crosstalk in quantum computing, paving the way for more robust and scalable quantum systems.

Abstract: Executing quantum circuits on superconducting platforms requires balancing the trade-off between gate errors and crosstalk. To address this, we introduce SurgeQ, a hardware-software co-design strategy consisting of a design phase and an execution phase, to achieve accelerated circuit execution and improve overall program fidelity. SurgeQ employs coupling-strengthened, faster two-qubit gates while mitigating their increased crosstalk through a tailored scheduling strategy. With detailed consideration of composite noise models, we establish a systematic evaluation pipeline to identify the optimal coupling strength. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of real-world benchmarks show that SurgeQ generally achieves higher fidelity than up-to-date baselines, and remains effective in combating exponential fidelity decay, achieving up to a million-fold improvement in large-scale circuits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Short-time approximations and path integrals can be dominated by high-energy or large-field contributions, especially in the presence of singular interactions, motivating regulators that are suppressive yet removable. Standard regulators typically impose such suppressions by hand (e.g. cutoffs, higher-derivative terms, heat-kernel smearing, lattice discretizations), while here we show that closely related smooth filters can arise as the conditional map produced by interference in a coherently controlled, postselected superposition of evolutions. A successful postselection implements a single heralded operator that is a coherent linear combination of time-evolution operators. For a Gaussian superposition of time translations in quantum mechanics, the postselected step is $V_{σ,Δt}=e^{-iHΔt}\,e^{-\frac12σ^2Δt^2H^2}$, i.e.\ the desired unitary step multiplied by a Gaussian energy filter suppressing energies above order $1/(σΔt)$. This renders short-time kernels in time-sliced path-integral approximations well behaved for singular potentials, while the target unitary dynamics is recovered as $σ\to0$ and (for fixed $σ$) also as $Δt\to0$ at fixed $t$. In scalar QFT, a local Gaussian smearing of the quartic coupling induces a positive $(σ^2/2)φ^8$ term in the Euclidean action, providing a symmetry-compatible large-field stabilizer; it is naturally viewed as an irrelevant operator whose effects can be renormalized at fixed $σ$ (together with a conventional UV regulator) and removed by taking $σ\to0$. We give short-time error bounds and analyze multi-step success probabilities.

TL;DR: A protocol is developed to fabricate Fock states with over 10,000 photons in a single mode using a Kerr-engineered multi-lens setup in a waveguide array, achieving high confidence, with execution time scaling inversely proportional to photon number.

Motivation: Achieving highly excited quantum states in bosonic modes is vital for advancing quantum metrology and computing, often hindered by loss and complexity.

Method: Utilizing the waveguide array as a Fock-state evolve optical system and employing Kerr nonlinearity, a multi-lens method with phase and displacement operations is developed. Phase and displacement optimizations compensate for non-paraxial aberrations.

Result: Simulations show quantum state fidelities of 73% and above for up to 100,000 photons, with execution time scaling as N^{-1/2}. The protocol effectively mitigates photon loss.

Conclusion: The method drastically exceeds theoretical and practical state-of-the-art limitations. Realized quantum-classical transitions enable enhanced metrology and high-dimensional quantum information processing with significant advantages.

Abstract: The scalable preparation of bosonic quantum states with macroscopic excitations poses a fundamental challenge in quantum technologies, limited by control complexity and photon-loss rates that severely constrain prior theoretical and experimental efforts to merely dozens of excitations per mode. Here, based on the duality of the quantum state evolution in Fock state space and the optical wave-function propagation in a waveguide array, we introduce a Kerr-engineered multi-lens protocol in a single bosonic mode to deterministically generate Fock states exceeding $10,000$ photons. By optimizing phase and displacement operations across lens groups, our approach compensates for non-paraxial aberrations, achieving fidelities above $73\%$ in numerical simulations for photon numbers up to $N=100,000$. Counterintuitively, the protocol's execution time scales as $N^{-1/2}$ with the target photon number $N$, exhibiting robustness against the photon loss. Our framework enables exploration of quantum-to-classical transitions of giant Fock states, paving the way for advanced quantum metrology with significant quantum gains, and error-corrected quantum information processing in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising application domain for near-term quantum hardware, particularly through hybrid quantum-classical models that leverage both classical and quantum processing. Although numerous hybrid architectures have been proposed and demonstrated successfully on benchmark tasks, a significant open question remains regarding the specific contribution of quantum components to the overall performance of these models. In this work, we aim to shed light on the impact of quantum processing within hybrid quantum-classical neural network architectures through a rigorous statistical study. We systematically assess common hybrid models on medical signal data as well as planar and volumetric images, examining the influence attributable to classical and quantum aspects such as encoding schemes, entanglement, and circuit size. We find that in best-case scenarios, hybrid models show performance comparable to their classical counterparts, however, in most cases, performance metrics deteriorate under the influence of quantum components. Our multi-modal analysis provides realistic insights into the contributions of quantum components and advocates for cautious claims and design choices for hybrid models in near-term applications.

Abstract: While questions on quantum simulation of ground state physics are mostly focussed on the realization of effective interactions, most work on quantum simulation of thermal physics explores the realization of dynamics towards a thermal mixed state under native interactions. Many open questions that could be answered with quantum simulations, however, involve thermal states with respect to synthetic interactions. We present a framework based solely on unitary dynamics to design quantum simulations for thermal states with respect to Hamiltonians that include non-native interactions, suitable for both present-day digital and analogue devices. By classical means, our method finds the control sequence to reach a target thermal state for system sizes well out of reach of state-vector or density-matrix control methods, even though quantum hardware is required to explicitly simulate the thermal state dynamics. With the illustrative example of the cluster Ising model that includes non-native three-body interactions, we find that required experimental resources, such as the total evolution time, are independent of temperature and criticality.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantum reservoir computing and, in particular, on quantum Wiener architectures (qWiener), consisting of quantum linear dynamic networks with weak continuous measurements and classical nonlinear static readouts. We provide the first rigorous proof that qWiener systems retain the fading-memory property and universality of classical Wiener architectures, despite quantum constraints on linear dynamics and measurement back-action. Furthermore, we develop a kernel-theoretic interpretation showing that qWiener reservoirs naturally induce deep kernels, providing a principled framework for analysing their expressiveness. We further characterise the simplest qWiener instantiation, consisting of concatenated quantum harmonic oscillators, and show the difference with respect to the classical case. Finally, we empirically evaluate the architecture on standard reservoir computing benchmarks, demonstrating systematic performance gains over prior classical and quantum reservoir computing models.

Motivation: Pauli strings are essential in quantum-classical algorithms, and their efficient computation is crucial for performance, especially with many qubits.

Method: PACOX uses compact binary encoding, XOR-based index permutation, and phase accumulation, combined with a parallel and pipelined PE architecture.

Result: Experiments show PACOX operates at 250 MHz, consuming 0.33 W, and efficiently computes Pauli strings up to 19 qubits.

Conclusion: PACOX significantly improves the performance and energy efficiency of computing Pauli strings, making it suitable for hybrid quantum-classical systems.

Abstract: Pauli strings are a fundamental computational primitive in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. However, classical computation of Pauli strings suffers from exponential complexity and quickly becomes a performance bottleneck as the number of qubits increases. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Pauli Composer Accelerator (PACOX), the first dedicated FPGA-based accelerator for Pauli string computation. PACOX employs a compact binary encoding with XOR-based index permutation and phase accumulation. Based on this formulation, we design a parallel and pipelined processing element (PE) cluster architecture that efficiently exploits data-level parallelism on FPGA. Experimental results on a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA show that PACOX operates at 250 MHz with a dynamic power consumption of 0.33 W, using 8,052 LUTs, 10,934 FFs, and 324 BRAMs. For Pauli strings of up to 19 qubits, PACOX achieves speedups of up to 100 times compared with state-of-the-art CPU-based methods, while requiring significantly less memory and achieving a much lower power-delay product. These results demonstrate that PACOX delivers high computational speed with superior energy efficiency for Pauli-based workloads in hybrid quantum-classical systems.

Abstract: Error mitigation (EM) methods are crucial for obtaining reliable results in the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers, where noise significantly impacts output accuracy. Some EM protocols are particularly efficient for specific types of noise. Yet the noise in the actual hardware may not align with that. In this article, we introduce Noise Tailoring (NT) -- an innovative strategy designed to modify the structure of the noise associated with two-qubit gates through statistical sampling. We perform classical emulation of the protocol behavior and find that the NT+EM results can be up to 5 times more accurate than the results of EM alone for realistic Pauli noise acting on two-qubit gates. At the same time, on actual IBM quantum computers, the NT method falls victim to various small error sources beyond Markovian Pauli noise. We propose to use the NT method for characterizing such error sources on quantum computers in order to inform hardware development.

Abstract: Quantum networks connecting quantum processing nodes via photonic links enable distributed and modular quantum computation. In this framework, quantum gates between remote qubits can be realized using quantum teleportation protocols. The essential requirements for such non-local gates are remote entanglement, local quantum logic within each processor, and classical communication between nodes to perform operations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate an unconditional Controlled-NOT quantum gate between remote diamond-based qubit devices. The control and target qubits are Carbon-13 nuclear spins, while NV electron spins enable local logic, readout, and remote entanglement generation. We benchmark the system by creating a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, showing genuine 4-partite entanglement shared between nodes. Using deterministic logic, single-shot readout, and real-time feed-forward, we implement non-local gates without post-selection. These results demonstrate a key capability for solid-state quantum networks, enabling exploration of distributed quantum computing and testing of complex network protocols on fully integrated systems.

Motivation: Improving the understanding and characterization of errors in quantum systems is critical for advancing quantum technologies.

Method: The authors used scramblon theory and examined the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model to derive their findings.

Result: Incoherent errors accumulate linearly, while coherent errors first increase quadratically before switching to linear accumulation.

Conclusion: These findings provide a framework for distinguishing and quantifying coherent and incoherent errors in quantum systems, aiding in error correction and mitigation efforts.

Abstract: Despite the rapid development of quantum science and technology, errors are inevitable and play a crucial role in quantum simulation and quantum computation. In quantum chaotic systems, coherent errors arising from imperfect Hamiltonian control and incoherent errors induced by coupling to the environment are both exponentially amplified during time evolution due to information scrambling. A fundamental question is how these two classes of errors imprint distinct signatures on the emergent irreversibility of many-body dynamics. In this Letter, we address this question by investigating multi-round time-reversed dynamics in the presence of both coherent and incoherent errors. By applying scramblon theory, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Loschmidt echo over different rounds of time-reversed evolution. For incoherent errors, the error accumulates linearly with the number of rounds, whereas coherent errors exhibit a crossover from quadratic to linear accumulation. These predictions are explicitly verified using the solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our results provide a theoretical foundation for characterizing and calibrating coherent and incoherent errors in reversed dynamics, with particular relevance to nuclear magnetic resonance systems.

Abstract: In this work we present an intuitive construction of the quantum logical axiomatic system provided by George Mackey. The goal of this work is a detailed discussion of the results from the paper 'Physical justification for using the tensor product to describe two quantum systems as one joint system' [1] published by Diederik Aerts and Ingrid Daubechies. This means that we want to show how certain composed physical systems from classical and quantum mechanics should be described logically. To reach this goal, we will, like in [1], discuss a special class of axiomatically defined composed physical systems. With the help of certain results from lattice and c-morphism theory (see [2] and [23]), we will present a detailed proof of the statement, that in the quantum mechanical case, a composed physical system must be described via a tensor product space.

Abstract: We analyze the role of virtual temperatures for passive quantum states through the lens of majorization theory. A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts. Thus, virtual temperature emerges as a key operational quantity linking passivity and majorization to the optimal performance of quantum thermal machines.

TL;DR: RFI-MDI-QKD offers robust security but struggles with rapid reference-frame changes, limiting its real-world application. We propose a new protocol that maintains high efficiency even with fast reference-frame variations, achieving superior key rates and tolerance to higher channel losses, enabling practical use in mobile platforms like satellite and drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in maintaining high efficiency and security in QKD when reference-frame variations are rapid and unpredictable. Previous protocols either couldn't handle such variations or needed extensive modifications, limiting their practicality outside controlled labs.

Method: We developed a classification-distillation method that reclassifies detection events, enabling secure key extraction without altering experimental setups. This allows the protocol to handle rapid reference-frame changes effectively.

Result: The new protocol achieves more than nine times higher key rates than previous methods and can tolerate up to 24 dB channel losses, significantly extending transmission distances and making QKD feasible for mobile platforms.

Conclusion: Our protocol enhances the practicality of RFI-MDI-QKD by ensuring high efficiency and security under varying reference frames, paving the way for real-world applications in satellite and airborne networks.

Abstract: Reference-frame-independent measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (RFI-MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks and avoids reference-frame calibration. While its feasibility has been widely demonstrated, existing implementations typically assume fixed or slowly drifting reference-frame misalignment, conditions rarely satisfied outside the laboratory. In realistic environments, rapid and free-running reference-frame variations can severely degrade both the key rate and transmission distance of conventional RFI-MDI-QKD. Here we propose a free-running RFI-MDI-QKD protocol that maintains high-rate key generation under rapid reference-frame variations. By introducing a classification-distillation method that reclassifies total detection events, secure keys can be extracted without modifying the experimental setup. Our protocol achieves a key rate more than nine times higher than the best previous RFI-MDI-QKD scheme and tolerates channel losses exceeding 24 dB, where earlier approaches fail. These results enable practical quantum key distribution on mobile platforms, including satellite-to-ground links and airborne nodes.

TL;DR: Junction readout provides a faster and high-fidelity alternative to dispersive readout for superconducting qubits by leveraging strong qubit-resonator coupling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a novel readout method that eliminates the limitations of dispersive readout, which has been hindered by Purcell decay and measurement-induced state transitions. The proposed junction readout method overcomes these issues, making it a faster and more reliable method for qubit measurement.

Method: The authors introduce a junction readout architecture that couples a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both capacitance and a Josephson junction, enabling a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction. This coupling allows for intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to measurement-induced state transitions. The method also involves engineering a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator using nonlinear coupling to achieve bifurcation-based readout.

Result: The junction readout method achieves a 99.4% assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4% QND fidelity, demonstrating significant improvements in both speed and fidelity compared to dispersive readout without relying on external filters or amplifiers.

Conclusion: By leveraging junction-based nonlinear coupling and bifurcation-based readout, this work provides a scalable and practical alternative to dispersive readout for fast, high-fidelity qubit measurement in superconducting quantum circuits without the need for external filters or near-quantum-limited amplifiers'}) {

Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits relies on a transverse capacitive coupling that hybridizes the qubit with the readout resonator, subjecting the qubit to Purcell decay and measurement-induced state transitions (MIST). Despite the widespread use of Purcell filters to suppress qubit decay and near-quantum-limited amplifiers, dispersive readout often lags behind single- and two-qubit gates in both speed and fidelity. Here, we experimentally demonstrate junction readout, a simple readout architecture that realizes a strong qubit-resonator cross-Kerr interaction without relying on a transverse coupling. This interaction is achieved by coupling a transmon qubit to its readout resonator through both a capacitance and a Josephson junction. By varying the qubit frequency, we show that this hybrid coupling provides intrinsic Purcell protection and enhanced resilience to MIST, enabling readout at high photon numbers. While junction readout is compatible with conventional linear measurement, in this work we exploit the nonlinear coupling to intentionally engineer a large Kerr nonlinearity in the resonator, enabling bifurcation-based readout. Using this approach, we achieve a 99.4 % assignment fidelity with a 68 ns integration time and a 98.4 % QND fidelity without an external Purcell filter or a near-quantum-limited amplifier. These results establish the junction readout architecture with bifurcation-based readout as a scalable and practical alternative to dispersive readout, enabling fast, high-fidelity qubit measurement with reduced hardware overhead.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子资源评估提供了实用且高效的技术。

Abstract: Quantum coherence and entanglement are fundamental resources in quantum technologies, yet their efficient estimation for unknown states by employing minimal resources in experimental settings remains challenging, particularly in high-dimensional systems. We present a machine learning approach based on support vector regression (SVR) that directly estimates the coherence measures and the geometric measure of quantum entanglement using minimal experimental resources. Our method requires only the diagonal entries of the density matrix, along with the traces of the squared and cubed density matrices for quantum coherence, and additionally along with the traces of the squared and cubed reduced density matrix for estimating quantum entanglement. These quantities can be obtained through random measurements or a hybrid quantum-classical framework. This approach significantly reduces the resource overhead compared to quantum state tomography while maintaining high accuracy. {Furthermore, the support vector quantile regression (SVQR) with pinball loss is employed to prevent SVR overestimation. This model not only ensures that over 95\% of predictions are conservative lower bounds in most cases, but also maintains this lower-bound reliability for over 93\% of predictions, despite 2\% perturbations in the input features.} The proposed technique provides a practical and scalable tool for characterizing quantum resources across computation, communication, and metrology applications.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers requires tight integration of cryogenic control electronics with quantum processors, where Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) face severe power and area constraints. We investigate quantum neural network (QNN) training and inference under finite DAC resolution constraints across various DAC resolutions. Pre-trained QNNs achieve accuracy nearly indistinguishable from infinite-precision baselines when deployed on quantum systems with 6-bit DAC control electronics, exhibiting an elbow curve with diminishing returns beyond 4 bits. However, training under quantization reveals gradient deadlock below 12-bit resolution as gradient magnitudes fall below quantization step sizes. We introduce temperature-controlled stochasticity that overcomes this through probabilistic parameter updates, enabling successful training at 4-10 bit resolutions that remarkably matches or exceeds infinite-precision baseline performance. Our findings demonstrate that low-resolution control electronics need not compromise QML performance, enabling significant power and area reduction in cryogenic control systems for practical deployment as quantum hardware scales.

Abstract: We propose a protocol for effectively implementing complex-balanced thermalization via Markovian processes on a quantum-circuit platform that couples the system with engineered reservoir qubits. The non-orthogonality of qubit eigenstates facilitates non-uniform heating through a modified Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation, while simultaneously supports amplification-dissipation dynamics by violating microscopic time-reversibility. This offers a new approach to realizing out-of-equilibrium states at given temperatures. We show two applications of this platform: temporally-correlated dichromatic emission and Liouvillian exception point protected quantum synchronization at finite temperatures, both of which are challenging to achieve with conventional thermal reservoirs.

TL;DR: A study on negatively charged boron vacancies in hexagonal boron nitride as a promising quantum sensing platform. The research highlights the challenges posed by hyperfine-split spin transitions and presents a novel approach using frequency-modulated microwave pulses to enhance spin-state transfer efficiency, enabling faster quantum sensing.Various theoretical models are compared, suggesting the feasibility of this method in practical applications under noisy environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum sensing has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by its potential in precision measurements and sensing applications. The development of platform-independent, robust, and high-efficiency quantum sensing techniques presents a critical need in this field.

Method: The research employs a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation. They calculate the energy splitting of boron vacancies and devise a frequency-ramped microwave pulse protocol for excitation. Quantum dynamics simulations are conducted to analyze the spin state transitions, and experiments are performed on isotopically enriched hBN to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

Result: The optimized microwave pulse method leads to a 4-fold increase in spin-state population transfer efficiency and reduces measurement time by a factor of 16 compared to resonant excitation during spin relaxation-based quantum sensing. Simulations validate the applicability of the two-state Landau-Zener model, and the approach shows promise for practical applications in noisy environments.

Conclusion: This research offers a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of quantum sensing with spin defects in hBN. The advanced pulse technique and its integration with theoretical models provide a promising pathway for practical quantum sensing applications, particularly in challenging environments with high noise levels.

Abstract: Negatively charged boron vacancies (V$_{\text{B}}^{-}$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) comprise a promising quantum sensing platform, optically addressable at room temperature and transferrable onto samples. However, broad hyperfine-split spin transitions of the ensemble pose challenges for quantum sensing with conventional resonant excitation due to limited spectral coverage. While isotopically enriched hBN using $^{10}$B and $^{15}$N isotopes (h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N) exhibits sharper spectral features, significant inhomogeneous broadening persists. We demonstrate that, implemented via frequency modulation on an FPGA, a frequency-ramped microwave pulse achieves around 4-fold greater $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ spin-state population transfer and thus contrast than resonant microwave excitation and thus 16-fold shorter measurement time for spin relaxation based quantum sensing. Quantum dynamics simulations reveal that an effective two-state Landau-Zener model captures the complex relationship between population inversion and pulse length with relaxations incorporated. Our approach is robust and valuable for quantum relaxometry with spin defects in hBN in noisy environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the potential of quantum generative models, particularly in data analysis and their applications across diverse fields like physics and artificial intelligence, is a key motivator for this research.

Method: The method involves developing a hybrid latent style-based QGAN incorporating a classical variational autoencoder for data encoding and a style-based QGAN for data generation. The study focuses on SAT4 image generation, tuning the autoencoder for stability, and evaluating performance using the FID score.

Result: The implementation achieves an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for the quantum generator compared to classical models, suggesting enhanced efficiency in tasks such as image generation and drug design.

Conclusion: The research provides foundational insights into the capabilities of hybrid latent style-based QGANs, paving the way for future advancements in quantum generative modeling and its practical applications.

Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is a very active area of research in looking for practical advantage in data analysis. Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.

Motivation: 随着量子技术的发展，量子热力计量在微小设备中的应用日益广泛。然而，现有的量子热力计量策略大多依赖于探针处于准平衡状态。然而，准平衡状态在快速、噪声大或非平稳的环境中并不适用，因此需要一种新的方法来提高量子热力计量的精度。

Method: 研究通过分析两个能级和Λ型能级探针与玻色环境的耦合，得出了非均衡初始化在量子热力计量中的优越性。研究者使用了量子费雪信息（QFI）作为评估热力计量精度的指标，并通过数值模拟和理论分析证明了Mpemba效应可以增强QFI，从而提高了热力计量的精度。

Result: 研究发现，Mpemba效应可以通过非均衡初始化 transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies和更冷的状态，从而实现了“热力计量Mpemba效应”。这意味着，可以利用 transient动力学来实现超快和纳米尺度的热力计量协议。这为量子热力计量提供了一种新的设计原则，突破了传统上认为Mpemba效应仅仅是热力学异常的观点。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何将Mpemba效应转化为热力计量中的实际优势，为量子热力计量提供了一种全新的方法。这不仅有助于提高热力计量的精度，还为量子技术的发展提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Quantum thermometry provides a key capability for nanoscale devices and quantum technologies, but most existing strategies rely on probes initialized near equilibrium. This equilibrium paradigm imposes intrinsic limitations: sensitivity is tied to long-time thermalization and often cannot be improved in fast, noisy, or nonstationary settings. In contrast, the \textit{Mpemba effect}, the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter states relax faster than colder ones, has mostly been viewed as a thermodynamic anomaly. Here, we bridge this gap by proving that Mpemba-type inversions generically yield a finite-time enhancement of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for temperature estimation, thereby converting an anomalous relaxation effect into a concrete metrological resource. Through explicit analyses of two-level and $Λ$-level probes coupled to bosonic baths, we show that nonequilibrium initializations can transiently outperform both equilibrium strategies and colder states, realizing a \emph{metrological Mpemba effect}. Our results establish anomalous relaxation as a general design principle for nonequilibrium quantum thermometry, enabling ultrafast and nanoscale sensing protocols that exploit, rather than avoid, transient dynamics.

Abstract: Numerically solving partial differential equations is a ubiquitous computational task with broad applications in many fields of science. Quantum computers can potentially provide high-degree polynomial speed-ups for solving PDEs, however many algorithms simply end with preparing the quantum state encoding the solution in its amplitudes. Trying to access explicit properties of the solution naively with quantum amplitude estimation can subsequently diminish the potential speed-up. In this work, we present a technique for extracting a smooth positive function encoded in the amplitudes of a quantum state, which achieves the Heisenberg limit scaling. We improve upon previous methods by allowing higher dimensional functions, by significantly reducing the quantum complexity with respect to the number of qubits encoding the function, and by removing the dependency on the minimum of the function using preconditioning. Our technique works by sampling the cumulative distribution of the given function, fitting it with Chebyshev polynomials, and subsequently extracting a representation of the whole encoded function. Finally, we trial our method by carrying out small scale numerical simulations.

Motivation: Achieving scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computation is crucial for building reliable quantum computers.

Method: Introduce a unitary encoding scheme for Pauli eigenstates in surface codes that preserves fault distance as code distance increases.

Result: Outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement schemes by reducing logical error rates significantly, especially useful for platforms with high gate noise.

Conclusion: This method is a breakthrough in fault-tolerant quantum computation, addressing key challenges in state preparation.

Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computation, the preparation of logical states is a ubiquitous subroutine, yet significant challenges persist even for the simplest states required. In the present work, we present a unitary, scalable, distance-preserving encoding scheme for preparing Pauli eigenstates in surface codes. Unlike previous unitary approaches whose fault-distance remains constant with increasing code distance, our scheme ensures that the protection offered by the code is preserved during state preparation. Building on strategies discovered by reinforcement learning for the surface-17 code, we generalize the construction to arbitrary code distances and both rotated and unrotated surface codes. The proposed encoding relies only on geometrically local gates, and is therefore fully compatible with planar 2D qubit connectivity, and it achieves circuit depth scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d)$, consistent with fundamental entanglement-generation bounds. We design explicit stabilizer-expanding circuits with and without ancilla-mediated connectivity and analyze their error-propagation behavior. Numerical simulations under depolarizing noise show that our unitary encoding without ancillas outperforms standard stabilizer-measurement-based schemes, reducing logical error rates by up to an order of magnitude. These results make the scheme particularly relevant for platforms such as trapped ions and neutral atoms, where measurements are costly relative to gates and idling noise is considerably weaker than gate noise. Our work bridges the gap between measurement-based and unitary encodings of surface-code states and opens new directions for distance-preserving state preparation in fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Abstract: One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing simulation strategies. Within this framework, the computational cost of a simulation algorithm is determined by the one-norm of an associated quasi-probability distribution, providing a common quantitative measure across different simulation approaches. This enables a comprehensive perspective on common methods for the simulation of noisy circuits based on different quantum resources, such as entanglement or non-stabilizerness. It further provides a clear scheme for generating novel classical simulation algorithms. Indeed, by exploring different choices of frames within this formalism and resorting to tools of convex optimization, we are able not only to obtain new insights and improved bounds for existing methods -- such as stabilizer state simulation or Pauli back-propagation -- but also to discover a new approach with an improved performance based on a generalization of the Pauli frame. We, thereby, show that classical simulation techniques can directly benefit from a perspective -- that of frames -- that goes beyond the traditional classification of quantum resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The understanding of non-locality and communication in quantum theory is fundamental. This research addresses the constraints on quantum resources in shared communication scenarios.

Method: The authors extended the simultaneous purification framework from states to instruments and used it to analyze multipartite scenarios.

Result: Generalizing the Bell framework to multipartite communication scenarios reveals limitations of quantum non-locality without signaling.

Conclusion: Any quantum protocol realizing beyond-quantum correlations must involve signaling, indicating strict limitations on non-communication-based quantum resources.

Abstract: Bell non-locality is a powerful framework to distinguish classical, quantum and post-quantum resources, which relies on non-communicating players. Under which restriction can we have the same separations, if we allow for communication? Non-signalling state assemblages, and the fact that they can always be simultaneously purified, turned out to be the key element to restrict the simplest bipartite communication scenario, the prepare-and-measure, to the standard bipartite Bell scenario. Yet, many distinctive features of quantum theory are genuinely multipartite and cannot be reduced to two-party behaviour. In this work we are interested in extending this simultaneous purification inspired result to all multipartite communication schemes. As a first step, we unify and extend the simultaneous purification result from states to instruments and super-instruments, which are composable structures, and open up the possibility to explore more complex communication scenarios. Our main contribution is to establish that arbitrary compositions of non-signalling assemblages cannot escape the standard spatial quantum Bell correlations set. As a consequence, any interactive quantum realization of correlations outside of this set must involve at least one signalling assemblage of quantum operations, even when the resulting correlations are non-signalling.

To address this issue, we introduce Quantum Elastic Network Models (QENMs) and utilize the quantum algorithm of Babbush et al. (PRX, 2023), which offers an exponential advantage when simulating systems of coupled oscillators under some specific conditions and assumptions. Here, we demonstrate how our method enables the efficient simulation of planar materials. As an example, we apply our algorithm to the task of simulating a 2D graphene sheet. We analyze the exact complexity for initial-state preparation, Hamiltonian simulation, and measurement of this material, and provide two real-world applications: heat transfer and the out-of-plane rippling effect. We estimate that an atomistic simulation of a graphene sheet on the centimeter scale, classically requiring hundreds of petabytes of memory and prohibitive runtimes, could be encoded and simulated with as few as $\sim 160$ logical qubits.

Abstract: Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree approximation of the time-evolved observable as soon as such an approximation exists. This provides the first provable guarantee about Majorana Propagation for Hamiltonian evolution. As an application of this result, we prove that Majorana Propagation can efficiently simulate the time dynamics of any sparse quartic Hamiltonian up to time $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ depending on the interaction strength $u$. For a time horizon $t \leq t_{\text{max}}(u)$, the runtime of the algorithm is $N^{O(\log(t/\varepsilon))}$ where $N$ is the number of Majorana modes and $\varepsilon$ is the error measured in the normalized Frobenius norm. Importantly, in the limit of small $u$, $t_{\text{max}}(u)$ goes to $+\infty$, formalizing the intuition that the algorithm is accurate at all times when the Hamiltonian is quadratic.

### [129] [Scalable Suppression of XY Crosstalk by Pulse-Level Control in Superconducting Quantum Processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05231)
*Hui-Hang Chen,Chiao-Hsuan Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A scalable pulse-level control framework is introduced to suppress XY crosstalk errors in superconducting quantum processors. The framework, based on frequency modulation and dynamical decoupling, significantly reduces infidelity in both idle and single-qubit gates across a dense system of five qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the scalability and operational effectiveness of quantum processors is a critical challenge in quantum computing research, particularly as systems grow larger and more complex.

Method: The method combines frequency modulation and dynamical decoupling to address XY crosstalk errors. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness in a two-qubit system, with further scalability validated in a five-qubit layout.

Result: Numerical simulations reveal orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. Scalability is further validated in a five-qubit layout where crosstalk suppression is maintained despite a dense configuration.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical route toward achieving high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures, paving the way for more efficient and reliable large-scale quantum computing systems.

Abstract: As superconducting quantum processors continue to scale, high-performance quantum control becomes increasingly critical. In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighboring qubits at the hardware level. However, frequency crowding in large-scale systems ultimately restricts the achievable frequency separation. While such XY coupling facilitates entangling gate operations, its residual presence poses a key challenge during single-qubit controls. Here, we propose a scalable pulse-level control framework, incorporating frequency modulation (FM) and dynamical decoupling (DD), to suppress XY crosstalk errors. This framework operates independently of coupling strengths, reducing calibration overhead and naturally supporting multi-qubit connectivity. Numerical simulations show orders-of-magnitude reductions in infidelity for both idle and single-qubit gates in a two-qubit system. We further validate scalability in a five-qubit layout, where crosstalk between a central qubit and four neighbors is simultaneously suppressed. Our crosstalk suppression framework provides a practical route toward high-fidelity operation in dense superconducting architectures.

Method: 采用旋转螺旋反射面，将旋转轴位移于声流定点，利用螺旋面的斜坡特性实现垂直平移。

Result: 实验与数值模拟证实了稳定的双向运动，垂直位移为$0.58λ$每转，最大高度为$3.18λ$，同时保持半径内 confinement在$0.24λ$。

Conclusion: 该方法通过机械运动实现levitation与平移，简化了电路设计，降低成本，适用于需要灵活Sample Handling的场景。

Abstract: Dynamic positioning in acoustic levitation typically depends on active control of the transducers phases, which necessitates complex driving electronics. While mechanically actuated reflectors offer a simpler alternative, achieving reversible transport along the vertical axis solely through mechanical actuation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate vertical particle translation using a rotating spiral reflector with a half-wavelength pitch. With the rotation axis laterally offset relative to the acoustic focus, the spiral surface functions as a series of translating slopes. Experimental and numerical results confirm stable, bidirectional transport, yielding a vertical displacement of approximately $0.58λ$ per revolution and a maximum height of $3.18λ$, with radial confinement maintained within $0.24λ$. This approach provides a cost-effective solution for non-contact sample handling without active phase control.

Motivation: The motivation for this paper is likely to address the need for efficient power rectification in varying power levels, possibly to optimize energy conversion or harvest.

Method: The method involves using two diodes with nonlinear impedance characteristics configured in parallel. The conductance of each diode is adjusted based on the input power, ensuring that the most suitable diode handles the power efficiently.

Result: Experimental results show that the rectifier achieves over 60% efficiency from 5 dBm to 29.5 dBm, providing a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.

Conclusion: The adaptive power division strategy using two diodes with nonlinear impedance characteristics significantly improves the efficiency and dynamic range of power rectification.

Abstract: This letter presents a novel adaptive power division strategy, which uses two rectifying diodes with nonlinear impedance characteristics that are configured in parallel to function optimally at their individual power levels. Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.

Abstract: Controlled and precise fabrication of structures with heights in the range of single digit nanometres is one of the challenges for diffraction gratings operating near-normal incidence in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray range. Here, we expand on previous research utilizing swelling of silicon after irradiation with ions as alternative to conventional dry etching. By irradiating silicon through a mask with a broad beam of nitrogen ions, we realized lamellar gratings in a precise and well controlled process. We were able to fabricate gratings with structure heights between (1.00 +/- 0.05) nm to (10.0 +/- 0.5) nm and a pitch of 1 micrometre, which is suitable for both EUV and soft X-ray applications. A variation of ion energy from 20 keV to 40 keV further expands the foundations of this process and yielded an additional parameter to control the resulting structure height and shape.

Abstract: We report a high-precision calculation of the photodetachment energy of the hydrogen anion{\normalsize{} }$\text{H}^{-}$. The nonrelativistic bound-state energy is obtained using an exact three-body approach, and supplemented by leading relativistic, quantum-electrodynamic, finite-nuclear-size, and hyperfine corrections. Our result is $6083.06447(68)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for the detachment to the hydrogen ground-state hyperfine level $\smash{(F=0)}$, which is 220 times more precise than the best experimental determination to date, $6082.99(15)\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, as reported by Lykke \textit{et al. }Beyond their intrinsic interest, these results provide critical input for antihydrogen physics, where controlled photodetachment of $\smash{\bar{\text{H}}^{+}}$ offers a path to producing ultracold antihydrogen (and its isotopes) for precision experiments.

Abstract: We report the first experimental study of the influence of a dielectric surface on the transmission spectrum of cesium atoms for the $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ ($D_2$) transition in vapor cells with thicknesses in the range $50$-$250\,$nm. The measurements were performed using a homemade optical nanocell filled with atomic cesium and featuring a wedge-shaped gap between the inner surfaces of sapphire windows. For atom-surface distances below approximately $300$\,nm, a significant red shift of the atomic transition frequency is observed due to van der Waals (vdW) interactions with the dielectric surface. An additional red shift arises at high vapor pressures owing to Cs-Cs interactions, with a measured contribution of $15$\,MHz/Torr, which must be accounted for in order to correctly determine the vdW coefficient $C_3$. By recording transmission spectra of the nanocell at different thicknesses, we determine for the first time the vdW coefficient for the Cs $6S_{1/2} \rightarrow 7P_{3/2}$ transition, obtaining values in the range $C_3 \sim 2- 20$\,kHz\,$μ$m$^3$. These results are of interest for fundamental studies of atom-surface interactions and are also relevant for the development of miniature sensors based on atomic vapors, in particular compact frequency references exploiting atomic transitions in the blue spectral region.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Laser-cooled ions confined in electromagnetic traps provide a unique, tunable mesoscopic system where the interplay of the trapping potential, nonlinear Coulomb interactions, and laser-ion scattering generates rich, collective dynamics. In this work, we engineer thermally activated switching between two oppositely oriented, square-pyramidal configurations of five laser-cooled ions in a Paul trap. For identical ions ($^{40}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), the inversions proceed via a \textit{Berry pseudo-rotation} mechanism with a low activation barrier, enabled by the permutation symmetry, in contrast to the \textit{umbrella inversion} observed in ammonia. The experimentally measured inversion rates, spanning two orders of magnitude, are accurately captured by the multidimensional Kramers-Langer theory, enabling thermometry of the Doppler-cooled ion cluster at $1.8 \pm 0.1$ mK. By substituting the apex ion with a heavier isotope ($^{44}\mathrm{Ca}^{+}$), we break the permutation symmetry and observe a suppression of thermally activated inversions. Numerical analysis reveals that this symmetry breaking closes the low-barrier channel, forcing the system to invert through a high-barrier \textit{turnstile rotation}. Thus, we demonstrate a structural analogue of molecular kinetic isotope effects, establishing trapped ions as a versatile platform to explore symmetry-controlled collective dynamics.

Abstract: Plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA) represent one of the promising new accelerator concepts that are now being developed intensively for future applications in high-energy physics and industry. Among the unresolved problems of practical implementation of PWFA there are maintaining the required quality (emittance, size, energy spread of bunches) and stable transportation of drive and accelerated (witness) bunches over long acceleration distances. For improving the bunch transport, we propose to fill the bunch transport channel with the background plasma, the density of which is lower than the main plasma density building up an accelerating wake wave. We call this waveguide structure a layered plasma waveguide (LPW). The wakefield excitation by a regular sequence of electron bunches in the LPW of cylindrical configuration has been explored both analytically and numerically. The layered plasma has been modeled as a combination of a tubular plasma and a plasma column of significantly different densities. The plasma column has a lower density. The dispersion dependencies of the TM-modes of the LPW was obtained and analyzed, and it was found that there was a single TM wave resonant with the electron bunch. Based on the obtained analytical expressions, the structures of the axial and radial wakefield amplitudes have been numerically investigated for the cases of a single drive bunch and a regular train of bunches. It is shown that for certain density ratios of the outer and inner plasmas, it is possible both to accelerate and focus simultaneously the drive and witness bunches. The 2.5D particle-in-cell code was used to simulate the witness acceleration of an electron bunch by a wakefield created by drive electron bunches in a two-layer plasma wakefield accelerator. The simulation showed good agreement with the results of analytical calculations.
