In gravitational asymptotically AdS spacetimes, TFT sectors which are putatively decoupled from local metric data are nevertheless non-perturbatively sensitive to Newton's constant via a sum over topologically distinct saddle point configurations. Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6458\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u573a\u8bba\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edfIR\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u6e10\u8fd1AdS\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002TFTs\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u548c bulk \u4e2d\u6709\u975e\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u62d3\u6251\u573a\u8bba\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "TFTs\u5c5e\u4e8eSwampland\uff0c bulk\u7684\u975e\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u4f9d\u5b58\u4e8e bulk \u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u62d3\u6251\u7b97\u5b50\u5728 bulk \u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86 bulk \u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement.

To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u9ad8\u9891\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2aL\u578b\u5149\u5b66\u8154\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sagnac-like\u65cb\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u6cf5\u9001\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a tabletop \u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u5728 DC \u533a\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5f53\u6fc0\u5149\u9891\u7387\u4e0e L \u5f62\u8154\u7684\u8c10\u632f\u9891\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u53d8\u5f97\u8fd1\u4e4e\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4 Cavitation-like \u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSagnac \u65cb\u6d41\u88ab\u5206\u6210\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e24\u6761\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6cf5\u9001\u8def\u5f84\u9a71\u52a8\u8154\u4f53\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u56fe\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9501\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8d85\u9ad8\u901f\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c tabletop \u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e L \u578b cavity \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c Sagnac-like \u65cb\u6d41\u7684\u6cf5\u9001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf cavity \u7684\u5149\u5b66\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u5176\u5728 DC \u533a\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u6fc0\u5149\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u8154\u4f53\u8c10\u632f\u9891\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca Sagnac \u65cb\u6d41\u5206\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u6fc0\u5149\u9891\u7387\u88ab\u9501\u5b9a\u5230 cavity \u7684\u8c10\u632f\u9891\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u53cd\u5c04\u5668\u53d8\u5f97\u51e0\u4e4e\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 cavity \u4fe1\u53f7\u7684 Michelson-like \u56de\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSagnac \u65cb\u6d41\u88ab\u5206\u6210\u4e86\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6cf5\u9001\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 cavity \u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d85\u9ad8\u901f\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684 cavity \u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u4eea\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 L \u578b cavity \u548c Sagnac-like \u65cb\u6d41\u7684\u6cf5\u9001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86 cavity \u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c lock \u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Starting from the exact two-body solution, we construct a non-translationally invariant Jastrow wavefunction that accurately captures the spatial structure induced by the cavity field and provides an efficient many-body ansatz for both bosonic and fermionic systems. We analize properties of three characteristic quantum systems, subject to long-range interactions: (i) ideal Bose gas (ii) interacting Bose gas (iii) ideal Fermi gas. In the absence of short-range interactions, we identify a crossover from a stable, weakly modulated phase realized for repulsive interactions to a delocalized bound state for attractive interactions, marked by clustering, loss of superfluidity, and the absence of a thermodynamic limit. Introducing short-range repulsion, either through contact interactions or fermionic statistics, leads to the formation of a mesoscopic gas-like regime that disappears in the thermodynamic limit. A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u5236\u5907\u5e26\u65e0\u9650\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8154\u4ecb\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u79fb\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684Jaswov\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7406\u60f3 Bose\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528 Bose \u548c\u7406\u60f3 Fermi \u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7269\u8d28\u72b6\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u548c\u6269\u6563\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8c\u4f53\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u51fa\u53d1\u6784\u9020 Jaswov \u578b\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u53ea\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u6807\u5fd7\u5305\u62ec\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u5931\u6d3b\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u548c\u77ed\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Starting from a mechanistic five-channel, density-dependent CTMC (symmetric self-renewal, symmetric differentiation, asymmetric division, dedifferentiation, TD death), we derive its mean-field limit and a functional CLT, obtaining a chemical Langevin diffusion whose explicit state-dependent covariance exactly matches the CTMC's aggregated channel-wise infinitesimal covariances. Within this diffusion approximation we remove the dedifferentiation flux and obtain a sharp dichotomy: in subcritical regimes the stem coordinate becomes extinct asymptotically almost surely, whereas in supercritical regimes polynomial moments diverge exponentially. This identifies, at the diffusion level, a structural failure mode of strictly hierarchical lineages under demographic fluctuations and clarifies how a cyclic return flux can rescue homeostasis. For interpretation we also derive an exact totals ODE backbone from a damage-structured transport model and obtain two steady-state constraints (ratio and equalization laws) linking compartment ratios to turnover and balancing dedifferentiation against fate bias.

Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, \"problem modification\" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bilinear observation problems often assume rank deficiency can be resolved with numerical refinement, but this paper shows that rank deficits are stable and require problem modification for recovery.", "motivation": "Understanding the limitations of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems is crucial for identifying when numerical methods are insufficient.", "method": "The paper analytically examines the rank and nullity of bilinear operators under tolerance variation, decomposing the nullspace into algebraic sectors to identify persistent deficits.", "result": "The study reveals extended rank plateaus indicating stable dimensional deficits that are resistant to numerical refinement, suggesting the need for structural changes to the problem.", "conclusion": "This work clarifies the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in addressing rank deficiency in bilinear systems, emphasizing the importance of structural changes for effective dimensional analysis."}}

At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars.

The aim is to monitor and detect stable and reliable precursor signals on an adequate time scale, well before an earthquake event, that can play a crucial role in activating alarms for civil protection systems. The precursor signal relies on continuous measurements of the time evolution of tectonic stress, obtained by interrogating underground, with a high energy collimated muon beam, the piezoelectric fabrics present in quartz rich granite like rocks surrounding a known seismogenic fault in the Earth crust. Beam propagation through the rock across the active fault conveys to a detector at the exit of the traversal information on the amplitude of the piezoelectric field, which scales with the tectonic stress applied to quartz crystals embedded in the rock. The system, named ERMES (Earthquake Reconnaissance using Muon beam Evolution in Silicon dioxide), differs from other techniques under study detecting electromagnetic signals generated by piezoelectricity outside the Earth crust, as it probes piezoelectric effects directly inside the source region of the associated electromagnetic field, namely the near field within quartz crystals rather than the far field in open space. We present a focused analysis of muon beam manipulation after rock traversal and before detection using a newly conceived muonic lens, and we explore the maximum rock penetration capability of a high energy muon beam, reaching about 3 km of rock thickness for a 10 TeV beam. Owing to the peculiarity of muon propagation through such kilometer scale targets, we cross checked previous FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to clarify the secondary muons role generated by primary muon interactions in solid matter over long propagation lengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper describes a method using muon beams to detect precursor signals for earthquakes by measuring tectonic stress changes along active faults.

In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit.

The instrument consists of a glow-discharge ion source for production of bright and stable ion currents, a quadrupole mass filter for mass selection and detection, and a quadrupole ion trap capable of trapping reactants and products for the long times needed to measure slow kinetics. The performance and adaptability of the glow-discharge ion source has been evaluated using several configurations.

The model reveals a fundamental trade-off whereby increasing the multilayer period number enhances reflectivity but simultaneously elevates temperature by impeding heat dissipation. Interference-driven volumetric absorption further gives rise to pronounced axial temperature gradients and a post-pulse downward migration of the heat-flux maximum, a delayed-heating effect inaccessible to conventional surface-flux-based models. Systematic analysis establishes scaling laws connecting interfacial thermal resistance, beam size, and incident energy density to thermal confinement and temperature rise.

Nosov"], "title": "Composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid in a half-filled Chern band", "comment": "5 pages, 4 figures, 22 page appendix", "summary": "The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles.

We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators.

Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $\u03bc$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $\u03bc$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency.

In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-Andr\u00e9-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{typ}}\\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-Andr\u00e9-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap.

We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\\sim 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field.

In parallel, advances in nanophotonics have enabled wavefront control through metasurfaces, a capability that has transformed fields such as microscopy by allowing tailored control of optical propagation. This naturally raises the following question, which we address in this perspective: can wavefront-control strategies be leveraged to improve scintillation-based imaging? To answer this question, we explore nanophotonic- and metasurface-enabled wavefront control in scintillators to mitigate image blurring arising from their intrinsically diffuse light emission. While depth-of-field extension in scintillation faces fundamental limitations absent in microscopy, this approach reveals promising avenues, including stacked scintillators, selective spatial-frequency enhancement, and X-ray energy-dependent imaging.

However, the opening process depends on many electrical parameters of the plant, and it re-quires determining their joint and individual effect on its dynamics. The purpose of this research is to study and determine the effects of electrical parameters, including those of the discharge voltages of the entire electrical circuit of the accelerator on the dynamics of the plasma opening switch, in particular opening speed, current amplitudes, and opening time, as well as to give recommendations on optimizing the operation of accelerators of this type and highlight possible ways to increase the voltage multiplication factor. Methodology. A method for determining the induced voltage according to experimental current oscillograms has been proposed. The methodology was verified by the coincidence of its data with the results of measurements by a capacitive voltage divider with the data spread of less than 20%. Scientific novelty. The rates of change in the current at the plasma switch opening stage were determined depending on the main electrical parameters of the DIN-2K accelerator.

Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6cd5\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528VQE\u3001SQD\u548cHI-VQE\u4e09\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9pyridine-Li\u79bb\u5b50\u590d\u5408\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "SQD\u548cHI-VQE\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfVQE\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7c7b\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates neutral free excitons in 2D electron-hole systems in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Two types of excitons are identified: heavy-hole excitons (HE) and light-excitons (X\u2070). EL spectra reveal energy, lifetime, and spatial properties consistent with 2D behavior. The x\u2070 exciton shows an energy level slightly above the bulk GaAs PL line, while its lifetime is significantly shorter than that of the bulk PL. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias and its properties are tunable via the topgate voltage. The x\u2070 exciton's brightness and emission timing also depend on the topgate voltage, and the temperate dependence of the x\u2070 peak energies supports a 2D character for these excitons. Time-resolved measurements suggest that the x\u2070 exciton is primarily responsible for the temperature-dependent emission. This work bridges the understanding of 2D exciton physics with 2DEG and 2DHG platforms in undoped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, showing that these excitons can be electrically generated and controlled.

The HE exciton shows Stark broadening and its emission properties are tunable by the topgate voltage.

We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Despite their biological relevance and numerous, detailed optical investigations of their photophysical properties, the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of their elementary optical excitations are not yet fully known. Here, we use ultrafast coherent vibrational spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution in the 450-nm spectral range to study their excited state coherent vibrational dynamics. We observe that coherent wavepacket motion along high-frequency C-C stretching modes with ~ 20-fs period is rapidly damped on a 20-fs timescale. In contrast, coherent motion along several low-frequency modes persists much longer. We attribute this to a mode-selective intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution driven by nonadiabatic couplings between the optical bright state and a close-lying dark electronic state, in accordance with model calculations.

Showing clear signatures of magnetism, this tetragonal system is suspected to host a concomitant quadrupolar order, which could be causing the strong enhancement of the ordering temperature when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the fourfold ($c$) axis of the lattice. In this work, we show that the field-temperature phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has a remarkable basal-plane anisotropy.

Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment.

These transient optics are immune to target debris and shrapnel and feature orders-of-magnitude higher damage thresholds than conventional solid optics, providing a promising method for efficiently manipulating high-energy lasers. In this work, we describe gas gratings that can efficiently diffract probe beams across a variety of wavelengths and pulse durations, ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared and from nanosecond to femtosecond, achieving a full beam diffraction efficiency up to 99% while preserving the focusability and wavefront quality. In addition, we present a comprehensive characterization of the performance of the gas gratings under various experimental conditions, including imprint fluence, gas composition, and grating geometries, showing significant enhancement of this process with the addition of carbon dioxide. We also demonstrate stable performance over hours of operation. Our results validate a previously developed theoretical model and suggest optimal parameters to efficiently scale gas gratings to high-energy applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6c14\u5bc6\u884d\u5c04\u5149\u6805\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u6c27\u589e\u52a0\u8f7dimer\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u64cd\u63a7\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6fc0\u5149\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6ce2\u6bb5\u548c\u8109\u5bbd\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5149\u675f\u805a\u7126\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCO2\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6548\u64cd\u63a7\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6fc0\u5149\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u6210\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u6280\u672f\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1) \u5236\u5907\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u7684\u6750\u6599\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b(2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7167\u5ea6\u3001\u6c14\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u6805\u683c\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b(3) \u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cf\u5149\u6805\u7684\u884d\u5c04\u6548\u7387\u548c\u805a\u7126\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u4ece\u6df1\u7d2b\u5916\u5230\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u7eb3\u79d2\u5230\u98de\u79d2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8109\u5bbd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff1b(2) \u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u7684\u884d\u5c04\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe99%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b(3) CO2\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff1b(4) \u5149\u6805\u5728\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u64cd\u63a7\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6fc0\u5149\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u4e3a\u5c06\u6c14\u5bc6\u5149\u6805\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u6fc0\u5149\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments.

This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space.

The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\u03b1$ and the KR field parameter $\\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field.

We show that for the two-electron integrals and CC amplitudes a block structure can be obtained by resolving the reducible products of two irreducible representations into their irreducible representations. To deal with the necessary resorts of the ordering of the two-electron integrals and amplitudes, spin-adaptation, and the O(M$^5$) contractions (with M as the number of basis functions) of a CC calculation, we suggest a strategy that uses both the reduced and non-reduced representation of the corresponding quantities and switches back and forth between them. While the reduced representations are the ones used in the O(M$^6$) contractions, the other steps are better carried out in the non-reduced representation. Our pilot implementation of the CC singles and doubles method confirms in test calculations for NH$_3$ and PH$_3$ using different basis sets that significant savings (of more than 20 compared to treatments without symmetry and about 5 compared to treatments using $C_s$ symmetry) are possible and suggest that the exploitation of non-Abelian symmetry would render CC computations on large highly symmetric molecules possible", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u70b9\u7fa4\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4ee5C3v\u7fa4\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55\u76f4\u63a5\u4e58\u79ef\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bc6\u52d2-\u5e93\u4ed1\uff08CC\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53ef\u7ea6\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u79ef\u5206\u548cCC\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u6392\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u7f29\uff08O(M^5)\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ea6\u5316\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7ea6\u5316\u8868\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ea6\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548cC_s\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728NH3\u548cPH3\u5206\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u548c5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5bf9CC\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a 1. \u5206\u6790C3v\u7fa4\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002 2. \u5efa\u7acb\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u79ef\u5206\u548cCC\u7cfb\u6570\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002 3. \u5f00\u53d1\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ea6\u5316\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002 4. \u5b9e\u73b0CC\u5355\u952e\u548c\u53cc\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7NH3\u548cPH3\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86NH3\u548cPH3\u5206\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4e0e\u65e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u548c5%\u3002\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528C_s\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea66\u548c2\u500d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9C3v\u7fa4\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bc6\u52d2-\u5e93\u4ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u79ef\u5206\u548cCC\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5904\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ea6\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65e0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8620%\u548c5%\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4C_s \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e866\u548c2\u500d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4f53\u73b0\u3002"}}

In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking.

Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\\sim 1/E^2$.

Here, we theoretically investigate heterostructures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) and an insulating substrate with gate-tunable band alignment. We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions. Conversely, with comparable effective masses, we find an interlayer excitonic insulator state at charge neutrality stabilized by interlayer Coulomb coupling.

In order to reflect the probability of quantum system in the quantum version of weak equivalence principle, we proposed a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross section at tree level, that is, the differential scattering cross section does not depend on the mass and properties of the scattered particles when the target particles take the large mass limit. This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter. In the non-relativistic case, the difference of differential scattering cross sections of scattered particles with different spin properties scattered by target particles is mainly reflected in the order of $ \\mathcal O (p _ {\\mathrm{cm}} ^2) $. In the relativistic case , we studied the asymptotic behavior of differential scattering cross sections at small angles. When the target particles are scalar particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \\mathcal O (1/\u03b8^2) $ order.

In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \\textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \\textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states\" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes.

Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.\n  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction.

We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise.

The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.",

We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(\u03c3) \\neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\\rm dec} = (\u03c0/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration. However, we observe that an acceleration-scaled potential as a function of the acceleration-scaled distance does not depend on the certain value of the acceleration This result, reflecting the scale invariance and self-similarity of the holographic setup, can be also obtained in the dimensionless metric after scaling of the coordinates onto the acceleration, $\\tilde{x}_i = a_c x_i$, for which one obtains an universal value of the phase transition temperature, $\\tilde{T}_{\\rm dec} = (\u03c0/3) \\tilde{T}_H = 1/6$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \\simeq 69.5\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \\simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\\rm tr} \\sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $\u03c9_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime.

This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $\u03b7$ or $\\bar\u03b7$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $\u03b7$ and $\\bar\u03b7$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $\u03b7^N \\bar\u03b7^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \\leq 2$ and any $N$.

While quantum cognition has successfully modeled such phenomena, it remains unclear whether quantum probability is merely a convenient assumption or a necessary consequence of decision dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework in which contextuality arises generatively from physically grounded constraints on decision making. By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting. These results indicate that quantum probability is not merely a descriptive convenience, but an unavoidable effective theory for adaptive decision dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Quantum probability emerges naturally from adaptive decision dynamics due to contextuality arising generatively.", "motivation": "Understanding the origin of quantum probability in decision-making processes is crucial for developing effective theories that go beyond classical probability.", "method": "A quantum extension of the Tug-of-War model is developed, incorporating conservation-based internal state updates and measurement disturbance.", "result": "Contextuality is shown to be a structural consequence of adaptive learning, leading to quantum probability as an unavoidable effective theory.", "conclusion": "Quantum probability is not a mere convenience but an essential feature of adaptive decision dynamics."}}

Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware. For distance-3 fault-tolerant error correction, our approach simultaneously reduces the time overhead via shorting the FTMS length and the hardware overhead through symmetry-enabled circuit multiplexing.

While optimal schemes are known for qubits, the extension to higher-dimensional qudit systems remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate optimal qudit overlapping tomography, constructing local measurement settings from generalized Gell-Mann matrices. By establishing a correspondence with combinatorial covering arrays, we present two explicit constructions of optimal measurement schemes.

In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u56e0\u9b54\u6cd5\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u70b9\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u7ecf\u5178\u62bd\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u95e8\u8def\u548c fermionic\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9b54\u6cd5\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u672c\u4f4d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5047\u8bbeOnly\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u6001\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7840\u6001\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u5c5e\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ecf\u5178\u62bd\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u7684 explicitly \u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u9002\u7528\u4e8e qubit \u5708\u8def\u548c fermionic \u5708\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u5206\u522b\u4ee5 Clifford \u548c Matchgate \u4f5c\u4e3a\u95e8\u8def\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u9b54\u6cd5\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f1a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f7f\u5f97\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u53d8\u5f97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c considere d noise channels like dephasing and particle loss\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b49\u7ea7\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97 threshold\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548conian\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u4f30\u7b97\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u4e5f\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u673a\u5236\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u6291\u5236\u6548\u5e94", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u65b9\u7a0b\u548cLindblad\u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u9891\u7387\u57281e5\u52301e7\u8d6b\u5179\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u884c\u4e3a", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f31\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u566a\u58f0\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u6da8\u843d", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8017\u6563\u5bf9\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2"}}

This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography.

In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We establish that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD), providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for this calibration strategy. Building on this formalization, we present a topology-aware block ordering obtained by casting order selection as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solving it efficiently with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. The SD-TSP cost reflects how a given block choice expands the reduced-circuit footprint required to evaluate the block-local objective, enabling orders that minimize per-epoch evaluation time. Under local crosstalk/bounded-degree assumptions, the method achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch, while retaining calibration quality. We formalize the calibration objective, clarify when reduced experiments are equivalent or approximate to the full objective, and analyze convergence of the resulting inexact BCD with noisy measurements. Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk. These results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings. These findings establish a quantitative framework for evaluating QEC under realistic noise environments and provide guidance for developing noise-resilient quantum architectures in near-term quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u3001\u65af\u5766\u7eb3\u548c\u73af\u72b6\u7801\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6270\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4e94\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u8fd8\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u6e29-state\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u4ec5\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\u624d\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8fd1\u7aef\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6270\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\uff08QEC\uff09\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5fae\u89c2\u7cfb\u7edf-\u70ed\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u4ee3\u7801\u5d4c\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e8c\u9636 master \u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4e94\u4f4d\u3001\u65af\u5766\u7eb3\u548c\u73af\u72b6\u7801\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6821\u6b63\u5468\u671f\u6570\u3001\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29 regime\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e94\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u6e29 regime\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u5e72\u6270\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4e94\u4f4d\u7f16\u7801\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u62d3\u6251\u548c concatenation\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u6e29-state \u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u8be5\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u624d\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u91cf\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "This paper presents a systematic study of adversarial hypothesis testing for both quantum-quantum (QQ) and classical-quantum (CQ) channels. Unlike conventional channel discrimination, we consider a framework where the sender, Alice, selects the channel input adversarially to minimize Bob's distinguishability. We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs. These results demonstrate a unique phenomenon in adversarial hypothesis testing where the CQ channel does not merely behave as a special case of the QQ channel.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50-\u91cf\u5b50\u548c\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002Alice adversary\u9009\u62e9\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Bob\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002\u5728Alice\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u8f93\u5165\u548cBob\u5df2\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u4e86Stein\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51faQQ\u901a\u9053\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6Bob\u5df2\u77e5\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u4f18\u52bf\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u53cd\u89c2CQ\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\uff0cBob\u83b7\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u73b0\u8c61\uff0cCQ\u4fe1\u9053\u5e76\u975e\u5176\u7279\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u9053\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u65f6ja\u8f93\u5165\u53caBob\u4fe1\u606f\u638c\u63e1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u3001\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u53caBob\u4fe1\u606f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684Stein\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u5076\u539f\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6838\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50-\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0cBob\u5df2\u77e5\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u968f\u8f93\u5165\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u610f\u589e\u52a0\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u8f93\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u5982\u4f55\uff0cBob\u83b7\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u5747\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u9053\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50-\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178-\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6b64\u7ed3\u679c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art.

An analytical model is proposed that describes the interaction of two radiation components with an atomic system using a $\u039b$ scheme and takes into account an additional level of excited state. Both weak and strong coupling regimes with off-resonant transitions are considered. It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5149\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u805a\u6355\u632f\u8361\u79fb\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u5149\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f31\u548c\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u533a\u7684\u975e\u5171\u632f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u9664\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u52a8\u6001 Stark \u79fb\u4f4d\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u4e3a\u53cc\u8272\u6fc0\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u79fb\u4f4d\u3002\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u989d\u5916\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u632f\u8361\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5bf9\u6fc0\u5149\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u79fb\u4f4d\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u968f\u5149\u5f3a\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u539f\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u573a\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u6807\u51c6\u7b49\u7cbe\u786e\u539f\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u03bb\u578b scheme\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u8272\u6fc0\u5149\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u79fb\u4f4d\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u79fb\u4f4d\u89e3\u6790\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u632f\u8361\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u79fb\u4f4d\u5173\u7cfb\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bbe\u5907\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u539f\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u9891\u7387\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5149\u573a\u4e0e\u539f\u5b50\u632f\u8361\u79fb\u4f4d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Several architectures based on shuttling have been proposed; it has been suggested that singlet-triplet (dual-spin) qubits could be optimal for the highest shuttling fidelities. Here we present a fault-tolerant framework for quantum error correction based on such dual-spin qubits, establishing them as a natural realisation of erasure qubits within semiconductor architectures. We introduce a hardware-efficient leakage-detection protocol that automatically projects leaked qubits back onto the computational subspace, without the need for measurement feedback or increased classical control overheads. When combined with the XZZX surface code and leakage-aware decoding, we demonstrate a twofold increase in the error correction threshold and achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in logical error rates.

Specifically, the search approach is ineffective when the source and target states are orthogonal. In this paper, we employ normalization, orthogonality, and energy limitations to demonstrate that it is unfeasible to breach time-optimality between orthogonal states with constant Hamiltonians when the evolution is limited to the two-dimensional space spanned by the initial and final states. Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space. Ultimately, we employ our quantitative analysis to provide meaningful insights regarding the relationship between time-optimal evolutions and analog quantum search methods.

From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions are quantified using various metrics, such as concurrence, entanglement power, and entangling capability. Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states.

Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero curvature, and a high level of complexity. In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length. In fact, longer paths that are sufficiently curved can demonstrate a complexity that is less than that of shorter paths with a lower curvature coefficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper explores the curvature of quantum evolution for a two-level system under time-dependent magnetic fields, establishing how curvature relates to efficiency, complexity, and geodesy.", "motivation": "Understanding quantum evolution's geometry helps in optimizing quantum computing and control, especially for efficient and less complex processes.", "method": "Used analytical math with a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian, derived an exact curvature expression, and analyzed its implications.", "result": "Curvature impacts complexity, with efficient paths being less complex; however, longer, curved paths can have lower complexity than shorter, straight ones.", "conclusion": "Curvature significantly affects both efficiency and complexity in quantum evolution, suggesting that trade-offs exist between path length, curvature, and system complexity."}}

While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques.

We provide theoretical guarantees on asymptotic performance and demonstrate strong performance on bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u514b\u65af\u5220\u9664\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eCSS\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\uff08qLDPC\uff09\u7801\uff0c\u8be5\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5254\u9664\u548c\u6709\u754c\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u731c\u6d4b\u4ee5\u7b26\u53f7\u5f62\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u731c\u6d4b\u9884\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u6743\u8861\u3002\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u9884\u7b97\u662f\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u7801\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5854\u7801\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50Low-Density Parity-Check (qLDPC)\u7801\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u514b\u65af\u5220\u9664\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5254\u9664\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6709\u754c\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u731c\u6d4b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528 Symbolic \u731c\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6821\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u731c\u6d4b\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u8282\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5f53\u731c\u6d4b\u9884\u7b97\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5f53_guess\u9884\u7b97\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u514b\u65af\u5220\u9664\u7801\u5668\u5728\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u7801\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5854\u7801\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f16\u7801\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7801\u5236\u7801\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u731c\u6d4b\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
