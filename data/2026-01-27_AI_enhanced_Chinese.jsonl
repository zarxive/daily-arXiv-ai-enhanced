Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.\n  For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.\n  These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.\n  Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.\n  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting \"hidden\" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.\n  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral \"hotspots\" and \"zeros\" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields.

Starting from the Gauss-Bonnet characterization of the finite distance deflection angle, we adopt the Li-type curvature primitive identity [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.124058] [2006.13047], which reduces the curvature-area contribution to a one-dimensional integral evaluated along the physical light ray. We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $\u03c6$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f84\u5411\u79ef\u5206\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001\u3001\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5149\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u66f2\u7387\u9762\u79ef\u8d21\u732e\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u6b8a\u53d8\u91cf\u66ff\u6362\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u8f68\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53d8\u5f62\u89d2\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u534a\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u548c\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8ba1\u7b97\u9879\u3002\u5728\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f31\u573a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7aef\u70b9\u5165\u5c04\u89d2\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u4e3e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u3001Kottler\u548c\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6d41\u4f53\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6709\u9650halo\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u60c5\u5f62\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5305\u542bhalo\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5f31\u53d8\u5f62\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9759\u6001\u3001\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u5b9a\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Li\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5c06\u66f2\u7387\u9762\u79ef\u8d21\u732e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u53d8\u91cf\u66ff\u6362\u6d88\u9664\u8f68\u9053\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5c06\u03c6\u79ef\u5206\u66ff\u6362\u4e3ar\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6210\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u5f31\u573a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53d8\u5f62\u89d2\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u534a\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u548c\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8ba1\u7b97\u9879\u3002\u5728\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f31\u573a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7aef\u70b9\u5165\u5c04\u89d2\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4f8b\u5b50\u5305\u62ec\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u3001Kottler\u548c\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6d41\u4f53\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6709\u9650halo\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5305\u542bhalo\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5f31\u53d8\u5f62\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f84\u5411\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u7ba1\u9053\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u79ef\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u5f31\u573a\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e3a\u540c\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To resolve this issue, we develop a biophysical model integrating calcium-mediated excitation with a detailed cross-bridge cycle to enable single-fiber simulations. Our model demonstrates that shortening velocity is the primary determinant of cross-bridge efficiency: efficiency peaks at an optimal velocity and declines at higher or lower velocities, while frequency exerts secondary influence. Critically, the velocity yielding peak efficiency remains consistent across frequencies, with a slight upward shift at higher frequencies.

The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper uses TR-APXPS with chemometric methods to study Fe2O3 reduction, addressing complex spectral data challenges by extracting pure peaks.", "motivation": "Process optimization and understanding reaction dynamics are motivations for this work on Fe2O3 reduction using TR-APXPS.", "method": "The study employs TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS to analyze surface chemistry and dynamics, addressing spectral complexity.", "result": "TR-APXPS with chemometric tools successfully extracts pure spectral profiles, aiding in understanding reaction mechanisms.", "conclusion": "This method contributes to optimizing processes and tailoring material properties through detailed surface analysis."}}

We define the model in terms of complex momentum-space couplings which break time-reversal symmetry (TRS), and detail how it may be experimentally realised using two-photon Raman couplings. In the weak-potential limit, we study the model analytically by calculating the bandstructure over a `quasi-Brillouin zone' (QBZ). We find symmetry-protected Dirac cones, which are gapped by a TRS-breaking term, resulting in a Chern number $\\mathcal{C}=1$. This provides a direct analogy to the Haldane model, but now in a quasicrystalline setting. We also infer the number of states below the topological gap from the QBZ area. We verify our analysis with numerical calculations of periodic approximants to our system, constructing a phase diagram in parameter space which shows a topological region extending beyond the weak-potential regime. We also find examples of narrow Chern bands with the potential for hosting strongly-correlated physics. Our work raises questions about the nature of localisation and strongly-correlated states in Chern bands in quasiperiodic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Within the previously identified $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex regime, we uncover a ferrichiral skyrmion phase characterized by a sublattice-resolved scalar chirality: two of the three sublattices carry unit skyrmion charge, while the third remains nonchiral. Using classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this ferrichiral skyrmion phase emerges at zero temperature and in the absence of both an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in sharp contrast to conventional skyrmion-hosting systems. The phase is stable over a wide parameter window and persists to relatively high temperatures. Our results reveal an unconventional route to skyrmion physics driven purely by frustrated exchange interactions and highlight the emergence of rich topological structures. Since both XXZ anisotropy and Kitaev interactions originate from the same spin-orbit-coupling mechanism, materials traditionally classified as XXZ magnets are expected to host finite Kitaev interactions as well. The potential for ferrichirality in these systems therefore warrants further investigation.", "AI": {"tldr":

Submitted to CHEP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime and signal pile-up, leading to systematic inefficiencies in conventional coincidence-based trigger systems. Such triggers typically rely on binary temporal windows and assume continuous sensor availability, causing partial or complete loss of correlated signal information during non-live intervals. We introduce Recursive Manifold Coherence (RMC), a geometric framework that reformulates distributed trigger logic as a continuous state estimation problem in a low-dimensional information space defined by correlated charge and timing observables. Instead of applying hard vetoes during deadtime, the proposed method employs a recursive update rule that propagates a coherence state across sensor nodes, allowing partially obscured signals to be retained and evaluated consistently. Using simulation studies representative of large optical detector arrays, we demonstrate that RMC successfully recovers event-level coherence for high-multiplicity topologies even when direct coincidence chains are broken. By treating the detector response as a smooth manifold rather than discrete hits, the framework achieves superior robustness against data fragmentation compared to standard binary logic. The framework is detector-agnostic and compatible with software-defined trigger pipelines, providing a flexible foundation for deadtime-aware analysis and triggering strategies in future distributed detector systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We develop a general theoretical framework to quantify these entanglement forms directly from scattering S-matrix elements and identify a novel class of entangled states-multimode hybrid cat states, that exhibit multimode discrete-continuum entanglement. Although applicable at arbitrary collision energies, the formalism is illustrated in the ultracold and cold regimes for inelastic Rb+SrF and Rb+Sr$^+$ collisions, as well as the chemical reaction F+HD $\\rightarrow$ HF+D, DF+H.

The motion of the centers of the electron wave packets, modeled by coherent states, is governed by independent classical trajectories so that the computation can therefore be parallelized very efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u5c55\u4e86 semiclassical \u5f3a\u573a\u57df Herman-Kluk \u5fae propagation (SFHK) \u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u6fc0\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04 (HHG)\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e Herman-Kluk \u5fae propagation \u548c\u5f3a\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684 HHG \u4ea7\u7387\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 HHG \u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u6c42\u89e3\u53d7\u539f\u5b50\u52bf\u548c\u6fc0\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u725b\u987f\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u6ce2\u5305\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7531\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8f68\u8ff9\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u5b50\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u6fc0\u5149\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e semiclassical \u5f3a\u573a\u57df Herman-Kluk \u5fae propagation \u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u53d1\u5c04\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 Herman-Kluk \u5fae propagation \u548c\u5f3a\u573a\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u4e86\u53d7\u539f\u5b50\u52bf\u548c\u6fc0\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5904\u7406\u7535\u5b50\u6ce2\u5305\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8db3\u4ee5\u91cd\u73b0\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6570\u503c\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u610f\u4e49\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97 HHG \u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c/cm Friends of Science \u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5fc3Cat \u5de6\u53f3\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

They are expected to be strongly chaotic, a necessary feature to capture the black hole dynamics. This dovetails nicely with the existence of various random matrix models of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, within which the BPS chaos must be contained as a subsector. This paper identifies and studies a simple random matrix model that underlies all known random matrix models of JT supergravity. It is argued that it captures many essential universal features of fortuitous BPS chaos. The model is topological, naturally interpolating between the Bessel and Airy models, where the gap energy $E_0$ controls the interpolation, and seems to have a simple intersection theory interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Static RG-improved black-hole spacetimes with an effective gravitational coupling depending on the areal radius and the Misner-Sharp mass are derived as vacuum solutions to these master field equations, and are thereby identified as solutions to generally covariant two-dimensional Horndeski theories. We discuss explicitly the embedding of previous key works on RG-improvement into the newly developed formalism to illustrate its broad range of applicability.

The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $\u03c0$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design.

However, the dynamics of droplet formation for heteronuclear Bose mixtures is partially understood. Here, we numerically analyze the formation process for homonuclear and heteronuclear boson mixtures in one dimension using a tight-binding model and real-time evolution. A systematic sweep of interaction strengths, mass ratios, and initial conditions allows us to characterize quantitative criteria for droplet formation and equilibration. We find that the energy contribution of the LHY correction dominates the energetic profile of the droplets formed, with the deepest binding occurring for mass ratios $m_2/m_1 \\in [1.2,2.0]$. Breathing oscillations are observed, and the low equilibration rate is consistent with the restricted nature of the phase space for one-dimensional systems; the oscillation frequency is found to have a very weak correlation to the interaction strengths.

It is planned to establish an experiment at Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and at the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) to search for high-frequency GWs in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 100 MHz. The basic idea is to use superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities to detect tiny harmonic deformations induced by GWs which change the boundary conditions of the oscillating electromagnetic field. This paper summarizes the challenging environmental boundary requirements, and the R&D to operate a cavity using a low level RF (LLRF) system which pushes beyond state-of-the-art accuracy and resolutions and a seismic noise mitigated cryostat at 1.8 K.

This article surveys whether such quantum voting protocols are practical. We begin by outlining core mathematical ideas such as the superposition principle, the no-cloning theorem, and quantum entanglement.

This work presents a novel two-stage classification framework for gamma-neutron discrimination: an initial physics-based energy threshold filters unambiguous low-energy gamma sources, followed by a machine learning ensemble that resolves ambiguities at higher energies. The detector response was characterized using $^{60}$Co (1.17/1.33~MeV), $^{137}$Cs (0.66~MeV), and a shielded $^{241}$AmBe source, with lead, paraffin, and cadmium shielding employed to isolate neutron and gamma interactions. Energy calibration established a linear ADU to MeV conversion ($R^2 = 0.966$), enabling identification of a neutron detection threshold at $2.62 \\pm 0.77$~MeV via a $3\u03c3$ significance analysis. Stage one categorizes sources as pure gamma (below threshold) or neutron-emitting (at threshold). For ambiguous cases above threshold, a machine learning pipeline utilizing pulse shape analysis was developed. A soft voting ensemble (Bagging, CatBoost, and MLP) achieved an accuracy of 0.816 and an AUC of 0.921.

However, engineering superchiral electromagnetic fields that can reliably amplify the faint signatures of chiral analytes remains profoundly challenging. Central to this difficulty is the need to balance two competing demands: maximizing the enhancement of chiral fields while maintaining a sufficiently large interaction volume for effective molecular interrogation. Here, we introduce a figure of merit (FOM) that captures the enhancement and spatial coverage of superchiral fields to benchmark different chiral-field configurations. We examine the effects of helix-geometry evolution on the FOM, including 2D to 3D chirality induction, winding-number escalation, helical-order enhancement, and transverse dilation. By tuning these structural degrees of freedom, the sensing volume can be enlarged without compromising the distribution and enhancement strength of fields. The optimized triple-strand helix markedly enhanced the analyte CD signal, yielding a FOM of 2.43*10^10 nm3, which surpassed prior 2D and 3D configurations by over an order of magnitude. The proposed FOM exhibits a strong linear correlation (R^2 = 0.9256) with the analyte CD signal.

One method of increasing interferometer sensitivity is to produce a larger momentum difference between interferometer arms through the use of large momentum transfer methods, such as Bragg diffraction. However, Bragg diffraction introduces systematic effects in the accumulated interferometer phase that are challenging to characterize.\n  A Bragg atom interferometer is described by the one-dimensional time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (1D-TDSE). In this paper we show that for the case of Bragg diffraction the 1D-TDSE partial differential equation can be separated into several systems of ordinary differential equations, allowing for the use of adaptive step size Runge-Kutta methods. We compare the convergence of this method to the split-step and Crank-Nicolson methods, and present a method for further computational speed-ups using a lookup table.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7adapter\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u901fBragg\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89ometer\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u4e00\u7ef4\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684Schr\u00f6dinger\u65b9\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957fRunge-Kutta\u65b9\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u8868\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8Bragg\u539f\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89ometer\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b65\u957fRunge-Kutta\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u8868\u6765\u52a0\u5feb\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Simulations\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

In earlier works, we defined a gauge-invariant flux tube entanglement entropy (FTE$^2$), the excess entanglement entropy of a region of gluon fields that can be attributed to the color flux tube, and demonstrated that it is finite in the continuum limit. FTE$^2$ was shown to have two contributions, one from the vibrations of the QCD string, and the other from its internal (color) degrees of freedom. In this work, we further explore the internal color component in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory for $SU(N_c)$ gauge groups, varying $2\\le N_c\\le5$. We identify a novel physical scale in the theory, the entanglement radius $\u03be_0$. This radius characterizes the transverse extent of the flux tube that must be completely severed by an entangling region to capture the entanglement entropy of color degrees of freedom. The key feature underlying this phenomenon is its topological nature. This is revealed through systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions in which FTE$^2$ changes sharply when boundaries of the slabs completely cross-cut the flux tube. We find that $\u03be_0$ increases approximately linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of both R\u00e9nyi replica number and the inter-quark separation length. We also study FTE$^2$ as a function of the entangling region's transverse displacement from the static quark pair and observe behavior consistent with a previously identified intrinsic width $\u03bb$ of the flux tube, with an extracted value in agreement with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the gauge groups studied.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper investigates the entanglement properties of the color flux tube between a static quark-antiquark pair in pure gauge Yang-Mills theory in (2+1)D. They introduce a new observable, FTE$^2$, which they argue captures the entanglement entropy contributed by the color degrees of freedom. They identify a characteristic length scale, the entanglement radius $\u03be_0$, which increases linearly with $N_c$ and is independent of other factors like the R\u00e9nyi replica number and inter-quark separation length. They find that $\u03be_0$ is related to the intrinsic width $\u03bb$ of the flux tube. The key findings are that the entanglement entropy contribution from color degrees of freedom scales with $N_c$, and this contribution can be directly linked to physical properties of the flux tube itself.", "motivation": "Understanding the entanglement properties of the color flux tube is crucial for gaining insights into the non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), particularly in the confinement regime. The identification of a scale-dependent entropy provides a bridge between the abstract concepts of entanglement entropy and the physical properties of the flux tube, such as its width and the number of colors in the gauge group.", "method": "The authors consider (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory with SU(N_c) gauge groups for $2\re... \u2264 N_c \u22645$. They employ systematic studies of multi-slab entangling regions to clarify how the boundaries of these regions interact with the flux tube. The calculation involves measuring FTE$^2$ before and after the flux tube is severed by the entangling regions. The linear dependence of $\u03be_0$ on $N_c$ is inferred by analyzing how $\u03be_0$ changes with different gauge groups.", "result": "The entanglement entropy contribution from the color degrees of freedom scales linearly with the number of colors $N_c$. A characteristic length scale $\u03be_0$, the entanglement radius, quantifies the transverse extent of the flux tube required to preserve the color degrees of freedom' entanglement entropy. $\u03be_0$ is independent of the R\u00e9nyi replica number and inter-quark separation length. This quantity increases with $N_c$ and is empirically consistent with the inverse mass of the lightest glueball for the studied gauge groups. Furthermore, the dependence of FTE$^2$ on the position of the entangling region shows behavior consistent with the intrinsic width $\u03bb$ of the flux tube.", "conclusion": "The study establishes a direct link between the entanglement entropy of the color flux tube and its intrinsic properties. The entanglement radius $\u03be_0$ scales with the number of colors $N_c$, and $FTE^2$'s dependence on position aligns with the flux tube's width. This work provides a foundational understanding of the relationship between flux tube properties and entropy, paving the way for future studies into the entanglement structure of QCD and the vacuum state of Yang-Mills theories."}}

This amounts to an anisotropic gyromagnetic ratio. To reveal its microscopic origin, we treat the spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation, integrate out the electronic degree of freedom, and show that in collinear ferromagnets the phonon angular momentum admits a dipolar structure in the spin-order space due to the constraint of the spin group symmetry. The spin-flipping and spin-conserving parts of the spin-orbit coupling contribute differently to such a dipolar structure. All these features are exemplified in a lattice electron-phonon model with ferromagnetic order and $C_{1h}$ point group symmetry.

For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($\u0394$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $\u0394$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $\u0394$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $\u0394$CC $>$ EOM-CC $>$ CI at the same order or $\u0394$CC $>$ $\u0394$MP $>$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5 paper \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a \u0394CC\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e0b\u90fd\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u53f7\u548c\u540c\u53f7\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u7535\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7b80\u5e76\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u0394CC \u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5355\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u6295\u5f71 CC \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5e76\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u0394CC \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u591a\u53c2\u8003 CC \u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e0e Li \u548c Paldus \u7684 SUMRCC \u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79bb\u5b50\u5316\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u9644\u52a0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u0394CC \u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u4f5c\u662f\u4ecb\u89c2 Green \u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u0394CC \u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u81f3\u516b\u91cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u57fa\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e CI\u3001EOM-CC \u548c SUMRCC \u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u53ca \u0394MP \u548c MBGF \u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u76f4\u81f3 FCI \u9650\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5 paper \u4e5f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7f29\u653e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5355\u3001\u53cc\u6fc0\u53d1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u0394CC \u5728\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e EOM-CC\uff0c\u0394CC \u5728\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u53cc\u6fc0\u53d1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e \u0394MP \u548c MBGF\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5 paper \u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684 \u0394CC \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u8be5 paper \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u0394CC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u53f7\u548c\u540c\u53f7\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u7535\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u81ea\u65cb\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u7b80\u5e76\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u5355\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u6295\u5f71 CC \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5e76\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e0b\u662f\u591a\u53c2\u8003 CC \u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5 paper \u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u5217\u5f0f\u57fa\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u0394CC\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u81f3\u516b\u91cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e CI\u3001EOM-CC\u3001SUMRCC\u3001\u0394MP \u548c MBGF \u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8be5 paper \u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7f29\u653e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5355\u3001\u53cc\u6fc0\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u0394CC \u5728\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e EOM-CC\uff0c\u0394CC \u5728\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u53cc\u6fc0\u53d1\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e \u0394MP \u548c MBGF\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5 paper \u63d0\u51fa\u7684 \u0394CC \u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u53cc\u6fc0\u53d1\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Employing Bogoliubov-de-Gennes analysis, we analytically compute the excitation spectra across a wide range of interaction strengths and coupling parameters. By systematically varying the SO and Rabi couplings, we uncover distinct dynamical signatures of quantum phase transitions, including mode softening, the appearance of roton-like minima, and miscibility-driven instabilities in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction regimes.

In this paper, the depolarization of ground-state hydrogen atoms caused by the time-dependent magnetic field of the circulating polarized proton beam is quantitatively evaluated. The hydrogen atom is treated as a four-level hyperfine system in a holding magnetic field, and transitions driven by harmonic components of the bunch-induced magnetic field are analyzed using time-dependent quantum-mechanical evolution along atomic trajectories. Numerical tracking of hydrogen atoms through the beam region is performed using nominal EIC beam parameters.

We focus on a lattice of four spins, where we calculate the ground-state energies, magnetic order parameters and correlation functions at uniformly applied conditions, which is repeated by all systems. Precise diagonalisation provides both a benchmark, which is symmetry-conserving, and a depth-two, physics inspired variational approximation, which provides simulations accessible to hardware.

We demonstrate that, for usual non-twisted (a = 1) BAFs, this method correctly reproduces the Noumi-Shiraishi formula directly from linear equations, resolving the ambiguity related to non-simple roots. For the first non-trivial twisted case (N = 3, a = 2) this method also fixes this ambiguity, moreover, answers for the first few layers of coefficients are in the form of direct quantization of [1].", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary.

Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper presents CMET, a general theory for multistage reactions in reaction-diffusion systems derived using QFT, capable of reproducing kinetics from other theories in their applicable ranges.", "motivation": "Understanding complex reaction kinetics, especially in systems with multiple stages, is crucial for various scientific fields.

We identify a suitable scaling that collapses all phase diagrams for different system sizes (i.e., total particle number) into a universal (system size-independent) phase diagram. The complete phase diagram for a confined system shows some significant qualitative differences compared to that of a condensate with homogeneous density distribution. The phase diagrams reported here could help identify the important parameter regimes in which phase transitions in the confined system, in general, occur.

The mutual relation between these methods is well-established. Recently, similar methods have been proposed for homogeneous, time-variant materials. Here we investigate their mutual relation and their relation with the corresponding methods in classical materials. For this analysis we make use of the fact that the wave equations for both types of material are similar, with the roles of time and space interchanged. However, the principle of causality holds for both types of material, hence, here the roles of time and space are not interchanged. We find that:\n  (1) whereas classical time-reversed acoustics involves emission of a time-reversed single-component wave field from a (ideally closed) boundary into the inhomogeneous material, its idealized counterpart involves emission of a sign-reversed two-component wave field, recorded in a time-reversed material, from a single time instant into the actual time-variant material;\n  (2) whereas classical Green's function retrieval involves temporal crosscorrelation of wave fields at two space locations in response to single-component sources on a (ideally closed) boundary, its counterpart involves spatial crosscorrelation of wave fields at two time instants in response to two-component sources at a single time instant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6750\u6599\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6750\u6599\u5728\u65f6\u53cd\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u58f0\u5b66\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5668\u5b98\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u6001\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6280\u672f\u201d\uff0c\u201c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u5668\u5b98\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u201d", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u53cd\u58f0\u5b66\u548c\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u9759\u6001\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u53cd\u58f0\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5206\u91cf\u6ce2\u573a\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u91cf\u6ce2\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6750\u6599\u3002"}}

This work compares two corresponding materials, the older M600 and the more recent M700, with EJ-276D and EJ-200 representing common plastic scintillators with and without pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) capabilities, respectively. Characterization measurements were performed with small samples of 26 mm diameter and 10 mm height, which were coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and simultaneously exposed to 252Cf fission neutrons and 137Cs gamma rays. M700 turned out to provide the best PSD performance and about the same light yield as EJ-276D, while its light pulses exhibit a shorter pulse decay. An accelerated ageing process applied in between two test campaigns was too short to trigger distinct performance degradation in any of the materials, though optical degradation was visible in EJ-276D and in EJ-200 but not in the PU-based materials. Nevertheless, the extremely robust polyurethane matrix promises advantages in medical and industrial applications where resilience and long-term stability are of crucial importance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PU-based scintillators show robustness and efficiency, M700 excels with better PSD and shorter decay, EJ-200 has some optical degradation, while PU materials are ideal for applications requiring durability.", "motivation": "The development of efficient and reliable scintillators is crucial for applications in medical and industrial settings, particularly where detection of gamma rays and neutrons is essential.", "method": "The study compares M600 vs M700 materials alongside EJ-276D and EJ-200.

However, coherent and broadband MIR modulation remains challenging owing to high optical loss, limited bandwidth, and large drive voltages in existing platforms. Here, we overcome these challenges by deploying a suspended thin-film lithium-niobate (TFLN) based electro-optic (EO) platform co-designed with high-performance traveling-wave microwave (MW) electrodes. We demonstrate a record-low Vpi,DC of 2.3 to 4.3 V over a broadband MIR bandwidth from 2.4 to 3.6 um, and a 2.7 dB EO bandwidth of 40 GHz (extracted 3 dB bandwidth of 50 GHz), yielding a figure of merit of 17.4 GHz/V, more than an order of magnitude higher than the state of the art.

Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $\u03be=\u03be_{0}\\left|Q\\right|^{1/2}$, being $\u03be_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=\u03bdH^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\u03bd$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($\u03c7_{\\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $\u039b$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. These findings, combined with the inherent ability of Unimodular Gravity to alleviate the cosmological constant problem, position dissipative UG as a robust and compelling alternative to the standard model, potentially suggesting that a very small but nontrivial energy nonconservation is compatible with the late-time observational data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Among them, spin-selective transport at room temperature is clearly one of the most promising properties in the quest for functional spintronic devices. In this context, two main effects have been experimentally investigated in the past 25 years and have attracted significant interest within the community: the so-called Electronic Magnetochiral Anisotropy (eMChA) and Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS). Despite extensive research, there is still a lack of consensus in the modeling of their microscopic mechanisms. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether the two are truly distinct or if they originate from a common physical cause. With the long-term goal of modelling the main different theories and to test them against the available experimental evidence, we programmed the core of an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo code. The current code models electron transport under an external voltage, distinguishes between $\u03b1$ and $\u03b2$ spin currents, and parametrizes molecules by their intrinsic electron mobility and the effective coupling between electron movement, spin and chirality. The code allows obtaining spin filtering values arising from the effective coupling between these three. We obtain an effect that vanishes at low voltages, with the asymmetry between positive and negative voltages typically found in electrical magnetochiral anisotropy experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses molecular chirality's role in spin-dependent filtering effects in quantum transport, focusing on eMChA and CISS.

We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling.

At a physical level, QEC codes perform parity checks on data qubits, producing syndrome information, through Syndrome Measurement (SM) circuits. These circuits define a code's logical error rate and must be run repeatedly throughout the entire program. The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system.\n  While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate. This is not modeled in NISQ-era tools, which instead optimize for targets such as gate depth or gate count to mitigate the chance that any error occurs. This gap leaves key questions unanswered about the expected real-world effectiveness of QEC codes.\n  In this work we address this gap and present PropHunt, an automated tool for optimizing SM circuits for CSS codes. We evaluate PropHunt on a suite of relevant QEC codes and demonstrate PropHunt's ability to iteratively improve performance and recover existing hand-designed circuits automatically. We also propose a near-term QEC application, Hook-ZNE, which leverages PropHunt's fine-grained control over logical error rate to improve Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE), a promising error mitigation strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u8def\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177PropHunt\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eCSS\u7801\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u6062\u590d\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528PropHunt\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u540d\u4e3aHook-ZNE\uff0c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5229\u7528\u4e86PropHunt\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u5916\u63a8(ZNE)\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63(QEC)\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum(NIL)-era\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651 syndrome\u6d4b\u91cf(SM)\u7535\u8def\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aPropHunt\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u4e8eCSS\u7801\u7684SM\u7535\u8def\u3002PropHunt\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316SM\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5e38\u89c4\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u6392\u5217\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1SM\u7535\u8def\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6062\u590d\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528PropHunt\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684SM\u7535\u8def\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u7ecf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c06PropHunt\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u5916\u63a8(ZNE)\u4e2d\uff0c\u94a9\u5b50-ZNE(ZE)\uff08Hook-ZNE\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177PropHunt\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u4e8eCSS\u7801\u7684SM\u7535\u8def\u3002\u6b64\u5de5\u5177\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u6062\u590d\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8ePropHunt\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5229\u7528\u4e86PropHunt\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u96f6\u566a\u58f0\u5916\u63a8(ZNE)\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u6b63\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5199\u9053\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

A simple unitary transformation gauges away the spatial dependence in the exchange term, leading to the generation of effective corrections to the Dirac dispersion. A full function's worth of freedom is obtained as a result. Choosing different pitch vectors, we show that many forms of novel phenomena arise in such systems. For example, a linear pitch vector leads to the generation of type-I Weyl semimetal -- we observe the anomalous Hall effect and the chiral magnetic effect. The anomalous Hall coefficient requires a non-zero pitch vector whereas the CME is proportional to the exchange coupling. The band structure of the model in the presence of a magnetic field shows a Lifshitz transition. The introduction of a suitable time dependent pitch vector leads to the formation of nodal spheres in the Sambe space of effective Hamiltonians.

Bulk properties show large variations that cannot be resolved by simply reducing the fitting error in small cluster QM dataset. Such instability in bulk phase simulation is a universal problem in the training of machine learning potentials (MLPs), and is particularly severe at CCSD(T) level of theory.In this work, using our range-separated water model as an example, we aim to overcome these limitations by developing a new training workflow. It is composed by several techniques including: 1. an active learning protocol that ensures more thorough sampling in different temperatures and densities; 2. an intermediate force label technique employing machine learning density functional; and 3. an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method. These techniques significantly stabilize the resulting water model, consistently achieving sub-chemical accuracies in both cluster energies and experimental properties.

Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2.

A key innovation through the miniaturization of the Kibble balance from a large-scale instrument into a tabletop device is making the quantum-based realization of mass accessible to a wider range of calibration laboratories and industries. This paper presents a tabletop Kibble balance design at Tsinghua University targeting E2-accuracy class mass calibrations from 1 g to 1 kg. For calibrating a mass of 1 kg, for instance, the required relative standard measurement uncertainty must be below 0.27 ppm to meet E2-accuracy class. Major components and features of the proposed system are discussed. A novel method of multi-harmonic excitation is proposed to improve the coil-motion linearity during velocity measurement. We show that injecting odd-order harmonics into the motion-driving current can significantly improve the uniformity of the coil's moving velocity, while the second-order component can address the asymmetry between upward and downward movements.

Here, we use a scanning diamond nanocrystal to investigate the interplay between the emission of room-temperature nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and a proximal topological waveguide. In our experiments, NVs serve as local, spectrally broad light sources which we exploit to characterize the waveguide bandwidth as well as the correspondence between light injection site and directionality of wave propagation. Further, we find that near-field coupling to the waveguide influences the spectral shape and ellipticity of the NV photoluminescence, hence allowing us to reveal nanostructured light fields with a spatial resolution defined by the nanoparticle size.

Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $\u039b$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $\u039b$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $\u039b$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated.

Specifically, we address conflicting mechanistic proposals, cavity-induced electronic corrections under VSC and the relevance of a previously debated Si-C-stretching motion of PTA for vibrational polariton formation. We first provide computational evidence for a two-step mechanism based on density functional theory and high-level coupled cluster results, identify new encounter and products complexes and illustrate the relevance of diffuse basis functions for a qualitatively correct description of anionic reactive systems. We subsequently show that cavity-induced dipole fluctuation corrections of electronic energies can be significant on the level of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster theory and discuss their qualitative impact on the proposed two-step mechanism taking into account cavity-induced molecular reorientation. We finally show that the Si-C-stretching contribution to the experimentally relevant double-peak feature of PTA exhibits a dominant dipole character, which renders it central for linear IR response and vibrational polariton formation despite the presence of CH$_3$-rocking contributions. The dipole character along the cleaving Si-C-bond is eventually shown to rationalize Rabi splittings throughout the proposed two-step mechanism.

While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \\(\u0394\u03c6_{\\rm AB} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T e \u03a6(t) \\, dt\\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \\(e \u03a6(0)\\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields. We verify the consistency of our gauge choice with Maxwell's equations and discuss the implications for local versus nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect. We also generalize the results to scenarios with nonzero external magnetic fields, where the enclosed flux is through the actual electron paths, and for circular paths of radius $R$, the AB phase shift is also proportional to the time average of the enclosed flux \\(\u03a6_{\\rm enc}(R,t)\\), with the total phase shift depending only on the initial enclosed flux \\(e \u03a6_{\\rm enc}(R,0)\\); for general non-circular paths, the external magnetic field affects trajectories and phase accumulation through the Lorentz force, leading to additional path dependence. These findings clarify the role of gauge-dependent potentials and induced fields in the generalized AB effect, offering new theoretical insights and potential applications in quantum technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u963f\u8d1d\u5411\u51cf\u5f31\u6548\u5e94\uff08AB\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u65f6\u53d8\u78c1\u573a\u77e2\u52bf\u4e0bAB\u76f8\u79fb\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u2020\u03c6_ABL = (e/T \u222b\u2080^T \u03a6(t)dt)\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u7535\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\u5706\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u603b\u76f8\u79fb\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\u4e3ae\u03a6(0)\u3002\u975e\u5706\u5f62\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u76f8\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u78c1\u52bf\u548c\u611f\u5e94\u7535\u573a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u9009\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\u5185\u7a7f\u8fc7\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u78c1\u573a\uff09\u53d7\u5230HeLocator\u2212in\u2212inask\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u7528\u6237\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fd1 Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65f6\u53d8\u78c1\u573a\u77e2\u52bf\u4e0bAB\u76f8\u79fb\u516c\u2026\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "1.\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5706\u5468\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e14\u78c1\u573a\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u60c5\u5f62\uff0cAB\u76f8\u79fb\u4e0e\u603b\u78c1\u573a\u6d41\u91cf\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u76f8\u79fb (\u2206\u03c6_AB)=(1/T)\u222be\u03a6(t)dt\uff0c\u52a8\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\u603b\u76f8\u79fb\u4e3a e\u03a6_0\u30022. \u975e\u5706\u5468\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u53d8\u5316\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6548\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u6d89\u53ca\u78c1\u52bf\u548c\u611f\u5e94\u7535\u573a\u30023.\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u9009\u89c4\u8303\u4e0e\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u30024.\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u79fb\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8def\u5f84\u5185\u7a7f\u8fc7\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u30025.\u5bf9\u4e8e\u534a\u5f84\u4e3aR\u7684\u5706\u5f62\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cAB\u76f8\u79fb\u4e0e\u901a\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u5747\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u603b\u76f8\u79fb\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u65f6\u7684\u7ba1\u901a\u91cfe\u03a6_enc(R,0)\u30026.\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u5706\u5468\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u78c1\u573a\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u76f8\u79fb\uff0c\u76f8\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u573a\u9002\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u52a8\u91cf\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u78c1\u573a\u4e0bAB\u6548\u5e94\u89c4\u5f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65f6\u53d8\u78c1\u573a\u4e0bAB\u76f8\u79fb\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u78c1\u573a\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u79fb\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u5185\u7a7f\u8fc7\u7684\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\uff1b\u82e5\u78c1\u573a\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5feb\uff0c\u76f8\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5207\u66ff\u6548\u5e94\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}}

The performance of the SiN x coating shows remarkable agreement with predictions, demonstrating a noise amplitude spectral density reduction of 0.82 with respect to current reference coatings, and validating our design-to-fabrication pipeline. The Ti:GeO2 -based system achieves the crucial goal of sub-ppm absorption; its measured thermal noise, however, is higher than the theoretically predicted level of 0.71, extrapolated from single-layer material characterization.

Submitted to CHEP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime arising from photomultiplier saturation, digitizer limits, and front-end readout constraints. Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The response is expressed through $L^{1}$-bounded kernels written in a piecewise \"local $+$ tail\" form, which makes transparent the separation between near-photon-sphere sensitivity and far-zone contributions (including AdS tails).

While intrinsic mechanisms such as the nonlinear Drude and Berry-curvature-dipole terms are well established, extrinsic contributions to thermoelectric responses arising from disorder-induced asymmetric scattering remain comparatively less explored, despite growing experimental evidence of their dominance. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of NNE and NSE that incorporates skew scattering and side-jump processes, identifying four distinct extrinsic contributions to NNE and two for NSE. A systematic symmetry analysis shows that these responses are allowed in time-reversal-symmetric non-magnets, PT-symmetric antiferromagnets, and non-centrosymmetric magnetic systems such as altermagnets. As a case study, we demonstrate that ABA-stacked trilayer graphene hosts large nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck responses dominated by extrinsic scattering, in excellent agreement with recent experiments.

Rev. Lett. 125, 040401 (2020)] propose that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase is locally mediated by entanglement between a charged particle and the quantized electromagnetic field, asserting gauge independence for non-closed paths. In this Comment, we critically analyze their model and demonstrate that the AB phase arises from the interaction with the vector potential \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), not from entanglement, which is a byproduct of the quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework. We show that their field-based energy formulation, intended to reflect local electromagnetic interactions, is mathematically flawed due to an incorrect prefactor and yields \\( +q \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{s}} \\) in the Coulomb gauge, conflicting with QED's \\( -q \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{s}} \\). This equivalence to \\( q \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{s}} \\) holds only approximately in the Coulomb gauge under static conditions, failing for time-dependent fields and other gauges, undermining their claim of a gauge-independent local mechanism. Furthermore, we confirm that the AB phase is gauge-dependent for non-closed paths, contradicting their assertion. Our analysis reaffirms the conventional explanation in the semi-classical picture, where the AB phase is driven by the vector potential \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), with entanglement playing no causal role in its generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "The authors argue that the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase is locally mediated by entanglement between a charged particle and the quantized electromagnetic field, but they are shown to be incorrect.

In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses the investigation of drag and two-stream instability effects in graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures.

A AlGaN barrier layer was introduced between the 2DEG and graphene layers to form the heterostructure.

The drag current was measured under varying temperatures and drive voltages to analyze temperature dependencies and quantum oscillations.", "result": "At low temperatures, the drag current in graphene exhibited clear quantum oscillations as a function of drive voltage. However, as the temperature increased, these quantum oscillations disappeared. Conversely, the magnitude of the drag current increased with temperature. The results indicate that the two-stream instability and drag effects are sensitive to temperature changes and the structural integrity of the barrier layer (AlGaN thickness). Reducing the barrier layer thickness to a few nanometers could enhance the drag effect, suggesting that alloy composition or mechanical exfoliation might further tune the drag coefficient for potential applications.", "conclusion": "The experimental results demonstrate that graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a feasible platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects. The findings point towards the possibility of controlling the drag effect by modifying the barrier layer thickness, which could lead to practical applications in electron transport and device design. Future research should focus on optimizing the structural properties for controllable drag effects and exploring device applications."}}

Using high-resolution tracking, the spatial distribution of light yield was mapped with a granularity of 0.5 mm. An average light response map was obtained by combining data from 27 cubes.

We enhance the Wasserstein-GAN framework with Fourier feature encoding, a learnable latent mapping network, and a physics-informed loss enforcing momentum conservation.

Although the analyticity of the flat-space S-matrix is widely established, it is difficult to apply this framework to de Sitter space because the growing backdrop breaks time-translation symmetry and makes it more difficult to define asymptotic states. The flat-space analyticity imprint on the de Sitter S-matrix is examined in this study. On a certain limit, we derive a comprehensive relationship between the flat-space amplitude and the de Sitter S-matrix. In particular, we demonstrate that the relationship is valid for tree-level amplitude exchanging with arbitrary local derivative interactions with a large scalar field. Next, we contend that this specific limit is more consistent with the definition of EFT since, similar to flat space, the Mandelstam variable may be identified as the unique energy scale because the total energy dependence of the de Sitter S-matrix becomes negligible. Finally, we also find an unexpected connection between the idea of generalized energy conservation of an S-matrix of four-dimensional de Sitter and exceptional EFTs in de Sitter space. We restrict the coupling constants in theories of self-interacting scalars dwelling in the exceptional series of de Sitter representations by requiring that such an S-matrix only has support when the total energies of in and out states are equal. We rediscover the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) and Special Galileon theories, in which a single coupling constant uniquely fixes the four-point scalar self-interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter.

Such periodic behavior is also observed while calculating the thermal conductance $\u03ba$ through the junction.

In this work, we identify a structurally defined family of classically hard maximum independent set (MIS) instances, and design and analyze a non-stoquastic adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm that exploits this structure. The algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves an exponential speedup over both transverse-field quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical solvers on these instances, under assumptions supported by analytical and numerical evidence. We identify the essential quantum mechanism enabling the speedup as the use of a non-stoquastic XX-driver to access a larger sign-structured admissible subspace beyond the stoquastic regime, which allows sign-generating quantum interference to create smooth evolution paths that bypass tunneling. This identifies a distinctive quantum mechanism underlying the speedup and explains why no efficient classical analogue is likely to exist. In addition, our analysis produces scalable small-scale models, derived from our structural reduction, that capture the essential dynamics of the algorithm.

Its simplified version with zero transverse dimensions is first considered. No phase transition occurs in this case at the intercept crossing unity. This simplified model is studied without more approximations by numerical techniques. The physically relevant model in the two-dimensional transverse space is then studied by the renormalization group method in the single loop approximation. The pomeron and odderon are taken to have different bare intercepts and slopes. The behaviour when the intercepts move from below to their critical values compatible with the Froissart limitation is studied.

In this Letter, a no-go result is established for a broad class of single-field effective scalar cosmologies where the kinetic response is modulated by the Hubble expansion rate, a structural feature characteristic of infrared-modified and nonlocal gravity theories \\cite{DeserWoodard2007, Maggiore2014}. It is proved that imposing ghost freedom, defined by the positivity of the kinetic response function $\\mathcal{M} \\equiv \\partial\u03c1/\\partial X > 0$, enforces the phantom divide ($w = -1$) as a \\textit{stability-protected boundary} in the cosmological phase space. While the equation of state can approach this limit arbitrarily closely, continuous ghost-free evolution into the phantom regime is shown to be strictly forbidden. The dynamics are found to converge toward a de~Sitter-like attractor where $w \\to -1$ emerges as a consequence of dynamical selection and stability rather than the fine-tuning of the scalar potential. These results suggest that the \"hints\" of evolution observed in DESI DR2 may reflect the underlying stability requirements of the effective field theory, providing a theoretical mechanism that prevents a physical transition into the phantom phase.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we present the direct spectroscopic observation of Cooper quartet resonances, a signature of correlated tunneling of two Cooper pairs across the device, in a graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ). Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport. To interpret our results, we develop a theoretical model that connects the observed quartet resonances to the coherent hybridization of multiple ABS branches, a hallmark of the rich pairing process enabled by multiterminal geometries.

The formula provides a clear separation of the effective potential into a part that contains the nonanalytic terms and a part that is purely analytic, and clarifies the origin of the nonanalytic terms. We obtain all the nonanalytic terms and show that only two types of nonanalytic terms arise: power-type and logarithmic-one. For a real scalar field with periodic boundary conditions, the manner of the emergence of these terms is highly characteristic; the two types never appear simultaneously.

The resulting Hamiltonian contains distinct curvature couplings modifying the internal potential and affecting the center-of-mass dynamics. These contributions imply that internal-energy variations do not always reduce to mass renormalization and can induce genuine forces due to changes in momentum. The initial research was motivated by anomalous friction-like forces emerging in quantum optics, and clarified that the anomalous forces are mere relativistic corrections from mass-energy equivalence.

We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $\u0394t$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $\u0394t$. At small $\u0394t$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u70ed CFT_d \u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u548c\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f62\u540e\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u865a\u90e8\u4e0d\u518d\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u7eed\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5728 d=2 \u65f6\u90e8\u5206\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e3a\u5b9e\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9 BTZ \u9ed1\u6d1e\u6574\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u5e8f\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u5728\u70ed\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u65f6\u5e8f\u8868\u9762\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u548c\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7eaf AdS3 \u548c\u65e0\u6bdb\u9ed1\u8272\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u865a\u90e8\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f62\u540e\u4e0d\u518d\u6052\u5b9a\uff1b\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5b9e\u503c\u03a8\uff1b\u5728 BTZ \u548c AdS3 \u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fb9\u754c\u53d8\u5f62\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u63ed\u793a\u3002"}}

By applying both the time-domain integration and the WKB method with Pad\u00e9 improvements, we show that the spectrum of massive fields differs qualitatively from the massless case. The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $\u03bc$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $\u03bc$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased.

For such problems, it is natural to reduce the effective search space by incorporating problem constraints at the initialization step, which in Grover's algorithm can be achieved by preparing structured initial states that encode constraint information. In this work, we present a systematic framework with a simple preprocessing procedure for constraint-aware initialization in Grover's algorithm, focusing on problems with linear constraints. While such structured initial states can reduce the number of oracle queries required to obtain a solution, their preparation incurs additional circuit-level costs. We therefore offer a conservative circuit-level resource analysis, showing that the resulting constraint-aware initialization can improve resource efficiency in terms of gate counts and circuit depth. The validity of the framework is further demonstrated numerically using the exact-cover problem. Overall, our results indicate that this approach serves as a practical baseline for achieving more resource-efficient implementations of Grover's algorithm compared to the standard uniform initialization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u7ea6\u675f\u7684Grover\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c11\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ebf\u8def\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8Grover\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u67d0\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u51c6\u5907\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5927\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u7ea6\u675f\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u878d\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7ebf\u8def\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u603b\u4f53\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0Grover\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5927\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8Grover\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7535\u8def\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u603b\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

In the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, we show that TEE of time-like boundary strips exhibits linear growth as a function of temporal width in the limit of large temporal width, and that its imaginary part carries physical significance rather than being a constant. By analyzing charged, scalar-hairy black holes, we present evidence that TEE detects a hidden \"causal phase transition\" separating Type-I and Type-II interiors -- distinguished by singularity structure. We identify a critical temporal width $\u03c4_c$ that acts as the order parameter for this transition: for strips narrower than $\u03c4_c$, the system enters a distinct \"time-like entanglement phase\" dominated purely by time-like contributions, up to a regulator effect; conversely, for strips wider than $\u03c4_c$, space-like entanglement re-emerges. Notably, the existence of a Cauchy horizon drives the $\u03c4_c$ to infinity, leading to pure time-like entanglement. These results suggest that the TEE may supply a novel boundary quantum-information measure to detect structure hidden inside the black hole and suggests a deep connection between TEE and cosmic censorship.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff08TEE\uff09\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u8fb9\u754c\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\u3002\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u9ed1\u6d1eAdS\u4e2d\uff0cTEE\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5f88\u5927\u65f6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u865a\u90e8\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u6bdb\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0TEE\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7c7b\u578b-I\u548c\u7c7b\u578b-II\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u2018\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u53d8\u2019\u2014\u2014\u7531\u5947\u70b9\u7ed3\u6784\u533a\u5206\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u03c4_c\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u79e9\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\uff1a\u5f53\u6761\u7eb9\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u03c4_c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5165\u7531\u7eaf\u65f6\u95f4\u8d21\u732e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u2018\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u76f8\u53d8\u2019\uff1b\u5f53\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5927\u4e8e\u03c4_c\u65f6\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u7279\u522b\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u67ef\u897f\u89c6\u754c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u03c4_c\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eaf\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eTEE\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6697\u793aTEE\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99 censorship\u6709\u7740\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u76f8\u53d8\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7 Schwarzschild-AdS \u548c\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u6bdb\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u7eb9\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u3002", "result": "\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u5728\u957f\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5448\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u865a\u90e8\u6709\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u6bdb\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0cTEE\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u76f8\u53d8\uff1b\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\u95f4\u5bbd\u5ea6\u03c4_c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f8\u53d8\u7684\u79e9\u5e8f\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5c0f\u4e8e\u03c4_c\u65f6\u8fdb\u5165\u7eaf\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u5927\u4e8e\u03c4_c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u67ef\u897f\u89c6\u754c\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f7f\u03c4_c\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eaf\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u578b\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The interaction between the particle's intrinsic magnetic moment and the black hole magnetosphere is modeled through a dipole coupling, and the equations of motion are derived using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We analyze equatorial circular orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit, and epicyclic oscillations, showing that the magnetic field strength and coupling parameter produce competing effects on orbital stability and fundamental frequencies. These frequencies are applied to model high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis constrains the black hole mass, magnetic field strength, field geometry, coupling parameter, and QPO orbital radius, highlighting the role of magnetospheric interactions in shaping both particle dynamics and timing properties of accreting black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u78c1\u77e9\u7684\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u5fb7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5916\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u5f62\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7b49\u6548\u8f68\u9053\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u73af\u5411\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5f31\u548c\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u57fa\u9891\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u9891\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684QPO\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\u8fdb\u884c\u675f\u7f1a\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u78c1\u573a\u6240\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u7c92\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u4e0e\u78c1\u573a\u6240\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7269\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u8bfe\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f-\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bfc\u51fa\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7b49\u6548\u8f68\u9053\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u73af\u5411\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u57fa\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u6240\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u8026\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u53caQPO\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u78c1\u573a\u4e0e\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5f31\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u5bf9\u8f68\u9053\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u9891\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e26\u7535\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u5fb7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5916\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u5f62\u78c1\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7269\u6001\u548c\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u6709\u7740\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u0127QPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In this work we identify the efficient unitary transformation enabling fast-forwarded evolution of the fermion-boson interaction term, yielding an interaction-picture based simulation algorithm with complexity polylogarithmic in $\u039b$. We apply this transformation to explicitly construct an efficient quantum algorithm for the Hubbard-Holstein model and discuss its generalisation to other fermion-boson interacting models.

However, existing NTA implementations rely almost exclusively on complex, large-footprint femtosecond laser systems, severely limiting practicality and scalability. Here, we demonstrate an NTA imaging platform that replaces the ultrafast laser with a compact nanosecond mid-IR source coupled to a high-definition indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) camera. Operating in the nanosecond regime removes stringent temporal-overlap requirements, dramatically simplifying system architecture while preserving high nonlinear sensitivity. Using this approach, we achieve chemically selective, wide-field imaging deep into the mid-IR molecular fingerprint region and demonstrate, for the first time, video-rate NTA imaging in this spectrally rich regime. By combining relaxed alignment constraints, compact excitation, and high-speed fingerprint-region imaging, this work establishes nanosecond NTA as a practical and scalable foundation for next-generation mid-IR chemical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf Mid-IR \u6307\u50cf", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d Mid-IR \u6307\u50cf\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\uff0c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u77ed\u8109\u51b2 Mid-IR \u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387 InGaAs \u73bb\u7483\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u677e\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6210\u50cf", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 Spectral Rich \u7684 Mid-IR \u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u7269\u6837\u7684\u5373\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u9009\u62e9\u6027", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMid-IR \u6307\u50cf\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840"}}

In this paper, we show that bulk-to-boundary correlators are highly constrained after imposing suitable fall-off conditions near future/past null infinity. More precisely, scalar bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a unique form up to a normalization constant, whereas fermionic bulk-to-boundary correlators are fixed to a linear superposition of scalar and fermionic branches. This is established by asymptotically expanding the Ward identities, where upon the leading terms decouple from the subleading ones. In the fermionic branch, the power-law exponent of the bulk-to-boundary correlator is greater by one than the fall-off index. Consequently, we revisit the relation between Carrollian correlators and momentum space scattering amplitudes for fermionic operators. In this context, we find that the Fourier transform bridging the two acquires an extra factor of $\\sqrt\u03c9$ for each fermionic operator. Furthermore, we reduce the bulk-to-boundary correlator to the boundary-to-boundary correlator and identify a critical fall-off index $\u0394=1$.

While known to generate anomalous weak values in the weak measurement regime and to reduce to classical probabilities under projective measurement, the physical mechanism governing its continuous transformation has been lacking. Here we demonstrate that the KD quasiprobability provides a general framework for all measurement regimes by identifying pointer-induced decoherence as the universal mechanism controlling this transition. We show that the decoherence factor F(t) simultaneously quantifies the loss of quantum coherence and interpolates the measurement strength from weak to strong. Within this framework, the KD quasiprobability naturally deforms from its full complex form-governing weak values-to the real, non-negative Wigner formula describing projective measurements, while maintaining informational completeness throughout the transition.

In both methodologies, we verify that the classical correspondence between the MKR model and self-dual fields exhibits modifications induced by very special relativity (VSR). Moreover, we employ the master Lagrangian approach to examine the duality when the self-dual model is minimally coupled to fermionic matter.

These effects emerge from the dynamic modulation of optical properties, which can mediate photonic transitions between eigenstates of different frequencies and/or wavevectors. To achieve such transitions, conventional approaches rely on periodic modulation schemes that demand ultrafast modulation rates and continuous energy input, posing significant practical challenges at optical frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that periodic-modulation-driven photonic transitions within the radiation continuum can be effectively mimicked using a single-period ultrafast pulse modulation, eliminating the need for sustained continuous modulation. By leveraging dispersion engineering in metasurfaces to tailor the density of states in the radiation continuum, we achieve controlled frequency transitions and theoretically demonstrate strong nonreciprocity for free-space waves as a key application. Our findings may guide future experimental research on time-varying photonics using materials such as transparent conductive oxides and semiconductors, expanding the possibilities for ultrafast and reconfigurable optical technologies. More broadly, our work may establish a practical and energy-efficient framework for dynamic photonic systems, with potential applications ranging from spatio-temporal wavefront manipulation to photonic computing and ultrafast signal processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper demonstrates that a single ultrafast pulse can emulate periodic modulation in photonic systems, enabling nonreciprocal light behavior without continuous modulation.", "motivation": "The motivation is to develop energy-efficient photonic systems that can emulate complex dynamic processes typically requiring high-speed, continuous modulation.", "method": "They used ultrafast pulse modulation and tailored the system's properties through dispersion engineering in metasurfaces.", "result": "This method allows for nonreciprocal light behavior, which could be applied in optical computing and signal processing.", "conclusion": "This approach avoids the energy and rate challenges of traditional methods, opening new possibilities for dynamic photonic systems."}}

In this paper, we use the $ AdS\\times S$ Virasoro-Shapiro machinery to extract strong-coupling CFT data of the D1-D5 CFT by extending and completing earlier analyses in several directions. First, starting from the superconformal/Mellin block expansion of four-point functions of half-BPS tensor operators with arbitrary external KK modes, we employ the full $ AdS\\times S$ Mellin formalism to bootstrap the $ AdS_3 \\times S^3$ Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude for general KK configurations. This establishes its consistency with superconformal symmetry and yields a wealth of additional CFT data naturally organized in internal Mellin space. Second, we push the computation to the next order in the strong-coupling expansion and extract additional higher-order CFT data. Third, we translate the resulting Mellin-space data into the internal spin basis. We derive the transformation kernel relating internal Mellin variables and $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry spins. As applications, we obtain explicit formulae for the scaling dimensions of long multiplets on the first two leading Regge trajectories of arbitrary internal spins, and certain three-point functions with half-BPS tensor operators.

We show that the multivariate R\u00e9nyi divergence $D_{\\underline\u03b1}(\\vec{P}_X)$ of probability distributions $\\vec{P}_X =(p^{(0)}_X,\\dots,p^{(d)}_X)$ and real-valued orders $\\underline\u03b1 = (\u03b1_0, \\dots, \u03b1_d)$ quantifies the economic-theoretic value that a rational agent assigns to $d$ lotteries with odds $o^{(k)}_X \\propto (p_X^{(k)})^{-1}$ ($k=1,\\dots,d$) on a random event described by $p^{(0)}_X$. In particular, when the odds are fair and the rational agent maximises over all betting strategies, the economic-theoretic value (the isoelastic certainty equivalent) that the agent assigns to the lotteries is exactly given by $w^{\\mathrm{ICE}}_{\\underline{R}}=\\exp[D_{\\underline\u03b1}(\\vec{P}_X)]$, where $\\underline{R}=(R_1,\\dots,R_d)$ is a risk-aversion vector with $R_k = 1+\u03b1_k/\u03b1_0$ being the risk-aversion parameter for lottery $k$. Furthermore, we introduce a new conditional multivariate R\u00e9nyi divergence that characterises a generalised scenario where the agent uses side information. We prove that this new quantity satisfies a data processing inequality which can be interpreted as the increment in the economic-theoretic value provided by side information; crucially, such a data processing inequality is a consequence of the agent's economic-theoretically consistent risk-averse attitude towards every lottery and vice versa. Finally, we apply these results to the resource theory of informative measurements in general probabilistic theories (GPTs).

Park", "Min Seok Jang"], "title": "Data-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver Through Dissipative Relaxation Transfer Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "In neural-network surrogate solvers for electromagnetic simulations, accurately modeling resonant phenomena remains a central challenge. High-amplitude resonances generate strongly localized field patterns that appear as outlier samples, deviating significantly from the general distribution of non-resonant cases, leading to instability and degraded predictive performance. To address this, we introduce dissipative relaxation transfer learning (DIRTL), a data-efficient training framework that integrates transfer learning with loss-regularized optimization principles from high-Q photonics. DIRTL first pretrains the model on data generated with a small fictitious material loss, which broadens sharp resonant modes and suppresses extreme field amplitudes. This smoothing of the response landscape enables the model to learn global modal features more effectively. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned on the target lossless dataset containing the true high-amplitude resonances, allowing stable adaptation based on the pretrained information. Applied to both the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and UNet architectures, DIRTL yields substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, including up to a two-fold error reduction for the FNO variant. Furthermore, DIRTL exhibits robustness across diverse training conditions and supports strong multi-task performance, underscoring the generalizability and flexibility of the pretrained core. Altogether, these results establish DIRTL as a physically grounded and architecture-agnostic curriculum for enhancing the reliability of machine-learning-based electromagnetic surrogate solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this respect, we impose two different equations of state to determine the deformation function and the new material contributions emerging from the additional field source. Furthermore, we describe the finiteness of all thermodynamic quantities of the presented stellar solutions, including the effective thermodynamical quantities, for varying values of the deformation parameter and total electric charge. We explore the new interior astrophysical solutions in three-dimensional gravity by analyzing the charged BTZ metric, admitting circular symmetry through the principles of geometric deformation. This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions. It is shown that new physically acceptable solutions by incorporating any known three-dimensional spacetime as the isotropic basis are possible, which in turn enable one to analyze the quantum effects due to low degrees of freedom at lower dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e09\u5ea6\u53bb\u505a\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7535\u8377 BTZ \u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u53d8\u5206\u79bb\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u53d6\u5185\u90e8\u661f\u5c42\u89e3\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u5bf9\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u4e09\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u53d8\u5bf9\u661f\u5c42\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8003\u8651\u7535\u8377\u6e90\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7269\u7406\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u53d8\u5206\u79bb\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u5f62\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u65b0\u7269\u8d28\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u5b57\u6bb5\u5c5e\u6027\u3002 \u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5e7f\u5ef6\u7269\u6001\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\u3002 \u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5f62\u53d8\u5206\u6790\u7535\u8377 BTZ \u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u7b49\u5730\u540c\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5df2\u77e5\u4e09\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8377 BTZ \u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5f84\u5ea6\u5f62\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u7b26\u5408\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u661f\u5c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5f84\u5ea6\u5f62\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u603b\u7535\u8377\u503c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6240\u6709\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u5747\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u3002 \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u7535 BTZ \u5ea6\u91cf\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f84\u5ea6\u5f62\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0b\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u4e09\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u60c5\u51b5\u5f97\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5229\u7528\u5f84\u5ea6\u5f62\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u4e09\u5ea6\u5e26\u7535 BTZ \u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u661f\u5c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002 \u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This object decomposes into primaries via the modular $S$-kernel: $\u03c7_{\\rm vac}\\left(-\\frac{1}\u03c4\\right)=\\int_{0}^{\\infty} dP S_{0P}(P,c)\u03c7_P(\u03c4)$. In this paper, we provide a bulk understanding of this spectral resolution using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with $two$ boundaries: an asymptotic torus and an excised Wilson line at the origin (\"stretched horizon\"). At infinity, we impose standard AdS$_3$ Drinfel'd-Sokolov (DS) gauge to obtain the Alekseev-Shatashvili (AS) boundary action for a coadjoint orbit. At the inner boundary, removing the Wilson line prepares the state at the cut as a sum over orbits of the $spatial$ cycle. Re-inserting a spatial holonomy Wilson line acts as a delta-function projector onto the corresponding primary, which together with boundary gravitons, reproduces the Virasoro character (e.g., of a conical defect). But we can also consider projectors onto the $conjugate$ basis $\\tilde P$, of the dual cycle. A key observation is that this leads to $S$-kernels instead of delta functions, with the BTZ character arising when the dual cycle label is in the exceptional orbit. Our two-boundary construction provides a bulk understanding of BTZ entropy: holonomy zero modes at the horizon have an effective central charge $c_{\\rm prim}=c-1$ from the kernel measure (primaries), while the universal Dedekind-$\u03b7$ in $\u03c7_P(\u03c4)$ contributes $c_{\\rm desc}=1$ from boundary gravitons (descendants). Together, they reproduce the full Cardy entropy.

In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.

However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB.

This approach enables simultaneous quantitative determination of RI for the bulk solution and the surface layer. This study utilizes the aluminum-based Kretschmann structure with the intensity interrogation technique. We construct the field-weighted model governed by the evanescent field penetration depth to decompose the SPR reflected intensity into the bulk and surface responses. Experiments are conducted using bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution to form a surface adsorbed protein layer, and different concentrations of BSA are tested. Results show that the separated surface response fits well with the Langmuir formula, representing a significant improvement over the untreated SPR signal. The bulk and surface responses are then incorporated into the field-weighted model to determine the RI values of the bulk BSA solution and the surface adsorbed BSA layer at various concentrations. The experimental results of BSA solution match the Abbe refractometer measurements with a maximum error 0.0004 in RI, while the results of the adsorbed BSA layer, both the RI and thickness, aligned well with reported parameters for a single BSA layer. This method eliminates the stage rotation in the common angular interrogation SPR technique and complicated optical design and nano-fabrication in the nano-optics sensing schemes, making it suitable for compact, low-cost SPR platforms for practical applications needing surface layer characterization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u573a\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u65f6\u5b9a\u91cf\u6d4b\u5b9a\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u539a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSPR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u7eb3\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8868\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfSPR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8868\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u94dd\u57faKretschmann\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u573a\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5ea6 interrogation\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06SPR\u53cd\u5c04\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u89e3\u4e3abulk\u548c\u8868\u9762\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d8b\u8fd1\u6df1\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u573a\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528\u725b\u9ec4\u7d20\u6eb6\u6db2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u725b\u9ec4\u7d20\u6eb6\u6db2\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u9762 adsorption\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8868\u9762\u5438\u9644\u725b\u9ec4\u7d20\u5c42\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Abbe\u6bd4\u8272\u4eea\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u57280.0004\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6d4b\u5b9a\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u7684\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u548c\u539a\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfSPR\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u89d2\u5ea6\u626b\u63cf\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5fae\u7eb3\u52a0\u5de5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3aSPR\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

We show that any EHL crossing a factorized partition must vanish, and that the EHLs between any set of blocks can be expressed as a sum of all the EHLs that join all of them. This last result allows us to provide an exact representation of the EE of any block of a pure state, from the sum of the EHLs which cross its boundary. In order to illustrate their rich structure, we discuss some explicit numerical examples using ground states of local Hamiltonians. The EHLs thus provide a remarkable tool to characterize multipartite entanglement in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e92\u60e0\u8d85\u5173\u8054\uff08EHLs\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u7eaf\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8d85\u5173\u8054\u6765\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8d85\u5173\u8054\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "EHLs\u4e3a\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8bb8\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u5173\u8054\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The observed force spectra show characteristic asymmetric lineshapes, suggesting Fano-resonance behavior. Eigenfrequency analysis confirms these effects arise from interference between discrete eigenmodes and continuum propagation states, with the eigenmode Q-factors correlating with transition sharpness.

The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions.

Meanwhile, complex systems often feature hierarchical structures with distinct scales for different layers, enabling high-level effective dynamics without exhaustive tracking of all possible degrees of freedoms. In this work, we report a study of the self-organization dynamics of highly-ordered soliton ensembles in a high-harmonic mode-locked fiber lasers through collective motions driven by nonlocal optomechanical interactions and local collisions, which exhibit a series of universal characteristics reminiscent of phase transitions. Moreover, the multi-soliton laser-field can be coarsely grained as a granular ensemble of limit-cycle oscillators with simple interaction rules derived from fine-scale physics. The self-organization of the multitude of solitons in the mode-locked laser cavity can then be mapped into a low-dimensional dynamic model that essentially reproduced the emergent process.

Writing $N=2^n$, we introduce an intrinsic descriptor layer in $U(N)$ by declaring as primitive the motions inside faithful embedded copies of $SU(2)$, leading to the phase-free dictionary $\\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\\mathrm{elem}}(n)=\\bigcup_{\u03c6\\in\\Emb(SU(2),U(N))}\u03c6(SU(2))$, and we also discuss the phase-inclusive $U(2)$ variant. We show that $\\Emb(SU(2),U(N))$ decomposes into finitely many $U(N)$-homogeneous strata indexed by isotypic multiplicities, with stabilizers given by centralizers; the canonical two-level sector is organized by $\\Gr_2(\\C^N)$ up to a $PSU(2)$ gauge. Equipping $U(N)$ with the Hilbert--Schmidt bi-invariant metric, each embedded subgroup is totally geodesic. Using two-level QR/Givens factorization together with an explicit generation of diagonal tori by two-level phase rotations, we prove phase-free universality $\\langle\\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\\mathrm{2lvl}}(n)\\rangle=SU(N)$ and hence $\\langle\\mathcal{G}^{SU}_{\\mathrm{elem}}(n)\\rangle=SU(N)$. Full universality in $U(N)$ follows by adjoining the abelian diagonal/global $U(1)$ factors (equivalently, by passing to the $U(2)$ two-level dictionary).

By rectifying this family of trajectories using the proper time as the time coordinate, the Novikov variables naturally emerge, providing a clear dynamical interpretation of the different regions usually identified as black-hole and white-hole sectors.\n  In Novikov coordinates, observers at fixed spatial position follow free-fall trajectories. From their perspective, the gravitational collapse of a dust star is completed in a finite proper time, independently of their initial distance from the star. In contrast, observers described by Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates perceive the boundary of the collapsing star as taking an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon.\n  We emphasize that Schwarzschild-Droste observers are static with respect to the center of mass of the star and therefore cannot be in free fall.

Wavelength matching between the lasing cavity and the external high-Q microresonator is required to accumulate Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback. Optical fiber can provide Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback for any lasing wavelength. However, optical fibers hundreds of meters or even kilometers long are required for the accumulation of Rayleigh scattering based optical feedback, hindering the integration of narrow linewidth lasers. Here, we present an integrated scheme that collects distributed feedback signal with weak wavelength dependence by exploiting surface radiation in a silicon waveguide. The effects of waveguide width on the intensities of the surface radiation and distributed optical feedback signal are first numerically analyzed by introducing a collection coefficient. Numerical calculations show that a 1 \u03bcm-wide strip waveguide yields optimal performance for excitation and collection of distributed optical feedback, which is also experimentally verified by measuring the feedback signal with an optical frequency-domain reflectometry. Benefitting from the enhanced distributed optical feedback that is 34.72 dB higher than that in a single-mode fiber, the hybrid integrated laser demonstrates an intrinsic linewidth of 1.52 kHz, a side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of 74.71 dB, and a frequency noise of 24.44 Hz2/Hz.

Typical QKD security proofs are carried out in an idealized setting where authentication is assumed to behave honestly: it never aborts, and all classical messages are delivered faithfully with their original timing preserved. Authenticated channels that can be constructed in practice have different properties. Most critically, such channels may abort asymmetrically, such that only the receiving party may detect an authentication failure while the sending party remains unaware. Furthermore, an adversary may delay, reorder, or block classical messages. This discrepancy renders the standard QKD security definition and existing QKD security proofs invalid in the practical authentication setting. In this work we resolve this issue. Our main result is a reduction theorem showing that, under mild and easily satisfied protocol conditions, any QKD protocol proven secure under the honest authentication setting remains secure under a practical authentication setting.

The laser employs two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) centered at 1420 nm and 1550 nm, which are connected into a single ring resonator via polarization multiplexing. Wavelength selection and tunability is realized using an ultra-broadband tunable filter based on a blazed grating. To suppress side longitude modes, an 18-meter-long femtosecond-laser-empowered random scattering fiber is utilized inside the cavity as a feedback medium, yielding an output linewidths between 1.54 kHz and 2.61 kHz. Benefited from the fast response of the galvanometer mirror and short relaxation time of SOAs, wavelength switching time is less than 1 ms under different tuning channels among the wavelength range of near 300 nm. The stable single-longitude-mode operation is maintained across the entire tuning range.

Random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble generate stochastic unitary dynamics of the quantum state, while equivalence classes reflecting finite detector resolution define classical observables as well as classical configuration-space and phase-space submanifolds. When the evolution is constrained to the phase-space submanifold, free Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics reduces to Newtonian motion, while stochastic motion constrained to the classical configuration-space submanifold yields ordinary Brownian motion in classical space. Transition probabilities under the stochastic dynamics satisfy the Born rule, whereas the constrained classical evolution produces the normal probability distributions characteristic of classical measurements. We show that, in this setting, measurement, state reduction, and the quantum-classical transition emerge from unitary dynamics alone, without invoking nonunitary collapse or additional postulates. Entanglement and EPR correlations arise geometrically from the evolution of joint states in composite state space, preserving locality in spacetime. The framework provides a unified dynamical account of measurement and classicality compatible with the structure of quantum mechanics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u4f46\u5355\u5143\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6295\u5f71\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ecf\u5178\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6f14\u5316\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u7531\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u725b\u987f\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u6f14\u5316\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u4f20\u9012\u6982\u7387\u6ee1\u8db3\u6ce2\u5c14 rules\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5982\u7ecf\u5178\u6d4b\u91cf\u822c\u7684\u6b63\u6001\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u6001\u7ea6\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u5316\u5747\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u9760\u5355\u5143\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u975e\u5355\u5143\u5316\u6536\u7f29\u6216\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5047\u8bf4\u3002\u7ea0\u7f20\u548cepr\u5173\u8054\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u6e90\u4e8e\u590d\u5408\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u4ece\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684 collapse \u5047\u8bf4\u548c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5047\u8bbe\u5e38\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\uff08\u6765\u81ea\u9ad8\u65af\u5e7a\u6b63\u7cfb\u7efc\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u968f\u673a\u7684\u3001\u4f46\u4fdd\u6301\u5e7a\u6b63\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u9650\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d41\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u6001\u7ea6\u5316\u548c\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5143\u6f14\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u975e\u5355\u5143\u5316\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u6216\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bf4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ea0\u7f20\u548cepr\u5173\u8054\u5728\u590d\u5408\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u6f14\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ecf\u5178\u8f6c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

They arise from the geometry of the space describing the properties of multi-component wave fields. An important example for electromagnetic waves is the spin-redirection Berry phase associated with the evolution of the spin direction. Because this effect has traditionally been studied in isotropic media where the spin is aligned with the ray trajectory, it has become commonly assumed that this spin-redirection Berry phase requires nonplanar rays. Here we show that a spin-redirection phase can in fact arise along a planar ray if the spin evolves along the ray. We expose this effect through the singular example of a moving unmagnetized plasma, and demonstrate how this behavior can more generally arise from a finite transverse spin. In identifying this new spin-redirection mechanism our work not only provides the tools to discover additional manifestations of SOIs in nature, but also uncovers supplemental degrees of freedom to harness SOIs to control light.", "AI": {"tldr": "A new mechanism for spin-redirection Berry phase along planar rays in unmagnetized plasma and the potential for additional Spin-Orbit Interaction (SOI) manifestations and light control.", "motivation": "Understanding the Berry phase mechanism and its applications in various physical systems is crucial.", "method": "Theoretical analysis of plasma dynamics and spin evolution, combined with experimental demonstration in a moving plasma.", "result": "The discovery of spin-redirection Berry phase along planar rays and its relation to finite transverse spin.", "conclusion": "New possibilities for exploring Spin-Orbit Interaction (SOI) in different media and applications in light control."}}

The decomposition is based on a smooth periodic extension of the identity map via the Fourier extension method, resulting in a sine series with exponentially decaying coefficients. Rewriting the sine series in terms of complex exponentials, then evaluating it on the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of a non-unitary operator, yields its approximation by a linear combination of unitaries. When implemented in a quantum circuit, the subnormalisation of the resulting block encoding scales with the double logarithm of the inverse error, substantially improving over the polynomial relationship in existing methods. For hardware or applications with a fixed error budget, we discuss a strategy to minimise subnormalisation by exploiting the overcomplete nature of the Fourier extension basis. This regularisation procedure traces an error-subnormalisation Pareto front, identifying coefficients that maximise the subnormalisation at a fixed error budget. Fourier linear combinations of unitaries thus provides an accurate and versatile framework for non-unitary quantum computing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6570\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ef6\u62d3\u6cd5\u5c06\u6052\u7b49\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u6ed1\u5468\u671f\u5ef6\u62d3\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u7ea7\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6b63\u5f26\u7ea7\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u590d\u6307\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5384\u7c73\u548c\u53cd\u5384\u7c73\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\u6807\u5ea6\u968f\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u53cc\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ef6\u62d3\u57fa\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\u3002\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5e7a\u6b63\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u5173\u952e\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u6216\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u7684\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ef6\u62d3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u6052\u7b49\u6620\u5c04\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u6ed1\u5468\u671f\u5ef6\u62d3\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u7ea7\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6b63\u5f26\u7ea7\u6570\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u590d\u6307\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u5384\u7c73\u548c\u53cd\u5384\u7c73\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u903c\u8fd1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6807\u5ea6\u968f\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u53cc\u5bf9\u6570\u57df\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ef6\u62d3\u57fa\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u8d28\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bef\u5dee\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u975e\u5e7a\u6b63\u7b97\u7b26\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5ef6\u62d3\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u5b50\u5f52\u4e00\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Here we present an all-optical analogue of coherent carrier injection by exploiting interference between second- and third-order quantum nonlinear processes in an integrated photonic platform. Photon pairs generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing coherently contribute to the same final two-photon state, resulting in a phase-dependent modulation of both the generation rate and the spectral structure of the emitted biphoton state. We illustrate the features of such interference and how it can be used to shape biphoton wavefunctions and their quantum correlations.

To date, this `coherence advantage' has been confirmed in proof-of-principle optical communications protocols using bulk optics. Taking full advantage of such opportunities necessitates processing multimode partially coherent light in integrated photonics platforms that alone provide the requisite stability for cascaded operations on a large scale. Here we demonstrate on-chip manipulation of four-mode partially coherent light described by a $4\\times4$ Hermitian coherence matrix. Starting with generic maximally incoherent light, we utilize an on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers to perform all the unitary and non-unitary tasks that are critical for realizing structured coherence: controlling the coherence rank (the number of non-zero eigenvalues of the coherence matrix); tuning the field entropy; molding the structure of the coherence matrix via $4\\times4$ unitary transformations constructed out of sequences of $2\\times2$ unitaries acting on pairs of modes; and tomographic reconstruction of the coherence matrix by measuring the modal Stokes parameters associated with Kronecker Pauli matrices.

Existing robustness techniques typically sacrifice clean accuracy or require prohibitive computational resources. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (DQAS) framework that addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing circuit structure and robustness through gradient-based methods. Our approach enhances traditional DQAS with a lightweight Classical Noise Layer applied before quantum processing, enabling simultaneous optimization of gate selection and noise parameters. This design preserves the quantum circuit's integrity while introducing trainable perturbations that enhance robustness without compromising standard performance. Experimental validation on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR datasets shows consistent improvements in both clean and adversarial accuracy compared to existing quantum architecture search methods.

It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies.

To address this issue, we propose a method to construct a significantly sparser logical QUBO model for these constraints. By adding auxiliary variables based on specific network structures, our approach decomposes the original constraint into smaller, more manageable constraints.

Nevertheless, the implementation of QET is severely impeded by the fundamental locality of gapped many-body systems, where the exponential clustering of ground-state correlations restricts energy extraction to microscopic scales. In this work, we address this scalability crisis within the framework of the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model. We initially provide a rigorous characterization of a monolithic measurement-induced strategy, demonstrating that while bulk projective measurements can theoretically induce long-range couplings, the approach is rendered physically untenable by exponentially diverging thermodynamic costs and vanishing success probabilities. To circumvent this impasse, we propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum repeater architecture adapted for energy teleportation. By orchestrating heralded entanglement generation, iterative entanglement purification, and nested entanglement swapping, our protocol effectively counteracts the fidelity degradation inherent in noisy quantum channels.

Our experimental results show that approaches using MATE with temporal-difference measure (MATE\\textsubscript{TD}), AutoMATE, MEDIATE-I, and MEDIATE-S achieved high cooperation levels across all dilemmas, demonstrating that communication is a viable mechanism for fostering emergent cooperation in Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QML\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8baeMATE\u3001MATE-TD\u3001AutoMATE\u3001MEDITATE-I\u548cMEDITATE-S\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548 fostered emergent cooperation.", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50Q-Learning\u4e2d\u7684MATE\u534f\u8bae\u53ca\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u7248\u672c\uff1aMATE-TD\u3001AutoMATE\u3001MEDITATE-I\u548cMEDITATE-S\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u730e\u9e7f\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u9e21orsch game\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728MATE-TD\u548cMEDITATE-I\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE JSAC", "summary": "Leveraging the quantum advantages of highly excited atoms, Rydberg atomic receivers (RAREs) represent a paradigm shift in radio wave detection, offering high sensitivity and broadband reception. However, existing studies largely model RAREs as isotropic point receivers and overlook the spatial variations of atomic quantum states within vapor cells, thus inaccurately characterizing their reception patterns. To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE. Furthermore, we derive the achievable beamforming gain by characterizing and balancing the fundamental tradeoff between the effects of increasing the vapor cell length and the exponential power decay of laser propagating through the cell. To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases. As a result, this segmented design expands the effective atom-field interaction area without increasing the total vapor cell length, yielding a narrower beamwidth and thus higher beamforming gain as compared with a traditional continuous vapor cell.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices offer a promising path for combinatorial acceleration, existing approaches typically treat the power grid as a \"black box\", suffering from poor scalability (barren plateaus) and frequent violations of physical constraints. Bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Hybrid Quantum-Classical Dispatching (PI-HQCD) framework. We construct a topology-aware Hamiltonian that explicitly embeds linearized power flow equations, storage dynamics, and multi-timescale coupling directly into the quantum substrate, significantly reducing the search space dimensionality. We further derive a noise-adaptive regularization mechanism that theoretically bounds the effective Lipschitz constant of the objective function, guaranteeing convergence stability under realistic quantum measurement noise. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark and a 118-bus regional grid demonstrate that PI-HQCD achieves superior economic efficiency and higher renewable utilization compared to stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Theoretical analysis confirms that this topology-aware design leads to an O(1/N) gradient variance scaling, effectively mitigating barren plateaus and ensuring scalability for larger networks.

We further evaluate the secure key rate of both BB84 and twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) using quantum-dot single-photon sources and compare their performance with that of Poisson-distributed photon sources (PDS) such as weak coherent pulses and down-conversion sources. The analysis reveals that adiabatic excitation offers a modest but consistent enhancement in secure key rate relative to resonant excitation. Moreover, quantum-dot single-photon sources outperform PDS sources over short and intermediate distances; however, at longer distances, PDS sources eventually surpass quantum-dot sources in both infinite decoy-state BB84 and TF-QKD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8d1f\u7535\u8377\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5728\u692d\u5706\u67f1\u5fae\u8154\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9707\u7ea7\u6fc0\u53d1\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u7edd\u7ecf\uff08ARP\uff09\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u663e\u793aARP\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u5149\u5b50istinguishability\u3002\u8fd8\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0e\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u5149\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5f31\u76f8\u5e72\u8109\u51b2\u548c\u964d\u9891\u5668\u6e90\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ARP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u5149\u6e90\u66f4\u5360\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u578b\u5355\u5149\u5b50\u5149\u6e90\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7528\u4e8eBB84\u548cTF-QKD\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5149\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "ARP\u6fc0\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u6539\u5584istinguishability\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u5149\u6e90\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u70b9\u5149\u6e90\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f18\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u8ddd\u79bb\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6cca\u677e\u5206\u5e03\u5149\u6e90\u66f4\u5360\u4f18\u3002"}}

We address this question by proving a universality theorem for the Many-body Projected Ensemble (MPE) framework, a method for quantum state design that uses a single many-body wave function to prepare random states. This demonstrates that MPE can approximate any distribution of pure states within a 1-Wasserstein distance error.

For optimization, a prominent candidate for quantum advantage, entropy benchmarking provides insights based concomitantly on the specifics of the application and its implementation, as well as hardware noise. However, such an approach still does not account for finite-shot effects or for quantum error mitigation (QEM), a key near-term error suppression strategy that reduces estimation bias at the cost of increased sampling overhead. We address this limitation by developing a benchmarking framework that explicitly incorporates finite-shot statistics and the resource overhead induced by QEM. Our framework quantifies quantum advantage through the confidence that an estimated energy lies within an interval defined by the best-known classical upper and lower bounds. Using a proof-of-principle numerical study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model at size $8\\times8$, we demonstrate that the framework effectively identifies noise and shot-budget regimes in which the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a representative QEM method, is operationally advantageous, and potential quantum advantage is not hindered by finite-shot effects. Overall, our approach equips end-users with a framework based on lightweight numerics for assessing potential practical quantum advantage in optimization on near-future quantum hardware, in light of the allocated shot budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5165\u6709\u9650\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6291\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u5bf9\u9009\u62e9\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u91cf\u5b50 utility \u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u6709\u9650\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u6291\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8d39\u7c73-\u54c8ubbard\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u91cf\u5b50\u9519\u8bef\u62b5\u6d88\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5c04\u7a0b\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u53d7\u6709\u9650\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd1\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Specifically, the quantum-mechanical bra-ket notation is used, illuminating some results of previous results. With this, we prove the six axioms of textbook quantum mechanics from a single axiom: every physical system evolves according to a, generally indivisible, stochastic law. Afterwards, we generalise the treatment to continuous bases, which showcases a problem with them, indicating that space (and other physical variables) may be discrete in nature. Some concrete examples are also given, including the generalisation to classical and quantum fields. Then, we treat some practical issues of this new stochastic approach, regarding the solving of problems in physics, which turns out to still be most tractable in the traditional way. Finally, we explain the classical limit, where a system of many particles is found to behave classically according to Newton's second law. Along with that, we present a way of solving the measurement problem, characterising what is an environment and a measuring device and explaining how the wavefunction collapse comes about. Specifically, it is found that what distinguishes an environment is its number of degrees of freedom, while a measuring device is a low-entropy type of environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7Stochastic-Quantum\u5bf9\u5076\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Barandes\u57282023\u5e74\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u9898\u6a21\u578b\u8bc1\u660e\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u516c\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u516d\u6761\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u57fa\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u8fde\u7eed\u57fa\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u51ed\u501f\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u65b0\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c11\u7c92\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u6b64\u5206\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u516c\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u66f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u6d4b\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5168\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u54f2\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u516c\u7406\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u516c\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u91cd\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u573a\u8bba\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u6781\u9650\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u539f\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e07\u7269\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570 collapse\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5224\u636e\u662f\u5176\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u88c5\u7f6e\u5219\u662f\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u71b5\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u73af\u5883\u3002\u8fde\u7eed\u57fa\u6001\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u4f7f\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u5907\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, non-unitary operations can also be implemented through block encodings, where additional ancilla qubits are introduced and later measured. While block encoding has a number of well-established theoretical applications, its practical implementation has been prohibitively expensive for current quantum hardware. In this paper, we present practical and explicit block encoding circuits implementing matrix polynomial transformations of a target matrix. With standard approaches, block-encoding a degree-$d$ matrix polynomial requires a circuit depth scaling as $d$ times the depth for block-encoding the original matrix alone. By leveraging the recently introduced Fast One-Qubit Controlled Select LCU (FOQCS-LCU) framework, we show that the additional circuit-depth overhead required for encoding matrix polynomials can be reduced to scale linearly in $d$ with no dependence on system size or the cost of block encoding the original matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the FOQCS-LCU circuits and their associated matrix polynomial transformations can be controlled with negligible overhead, enabling efficient applications such as Hadamard tests. Finally, we provide explicit circuits for representative spin models, together with detailed non-asymptotic gate counts and circuit depths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u53d7\u63a7\u9009\u62e9LCU\uff08FOQCS-LCU\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e9\u9635\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u65af\u7279\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165FOQCS-LCU\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e9\u9635\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eFOQCS-LCU\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "FOQCS-LCU\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728O(d)\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e9\u9635\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95e8\u9650\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

This includes both cut off versions of Anti de Sitter spacetime, as well as the generalization to bulk de Sitter spacetime, for which we introduce two additional examples capturing different patches of the bulk and incorporating the second branch of the square root dressed energy formula. We provide new calculations of entanglement entropy (EE) for more general divisions of the system than the symmetric ones previously available. We find precise agreement between the gravity side and deformed-CFT side results to all orders in the deformation parameter at large central charge. An analysis of the fate of strong subadditivity for relatively boosted regions indicates nonlocality reminiscent of string theory. We introduce the structure of operator algebras in these systems. The causal and entanglement wedges generalize to appropriate deformed theories but exhibit qualitatively new behaviors, e.g. the causal wedge may exceed the entanglement wedge. This leads to subtleties which we express in terms of the Hamiltonian and modular Hamiltonian evolution. Finally, we exhibit redundant encoding of bulk points, including the cosmological case.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
