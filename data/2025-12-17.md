### [1] [Topological and optical signatures of modified black-hole entropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13769)
*Ankit Anand,Kimet Jusufi,Spyros Basilakos,Emmanuel N. Saridakis*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了Bekenstein-Hawking熵偏差如何修改黑洞时空，并通过最近提出的熵几何对应关系进行了探讨。针对四种修正熵，即Barrow、Rényi、Kaniadakis和对数熵，推导对应的有效度量，并通过离壳自由能和扭结数对其热力学和拓扑分类进行了分析。结果显示，Barrow和Rényi熵导致一个不稳定的单体，带有全局电荷W=-1，而对数和Kaniadakis修正产生相互抵消的缺陷，带有电解荷W=0，显示出与施瓦zschild情况中缺失的拓扑结构。通过修改的度量，进一步计算了光球半径和阴影大小，显示每种修正熵关系都会引入特征的光效应偏移。通过与Sgr A*的观测结果进行比较，提取了所有熵估计参数的新界限。结果显示，热力学拓扑学，结合光球Phenomenology，提供了一种可行的方法来测试广义熵框架，并探查偏离Bekenstein-Hawking面积定律的行为。

Conclusion: 广义熵框架可以通过热力学拓扑和光球现象进行实验测试。

Abstract: We investigate how deviations from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy modify black-hole spacetimes through the recently proposed entropy-geometry correspondence. For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, Rényi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and Rényi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.

### [2] [A cyclic scale-invariance universe with negative variable cosmological constant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13906)
*Nasr Ahmed*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于带有时变负$Λ$的尺度不变引力模型，显示由于该$Λ$函数的存在，宇宙学没有未来奇点且表现出有机物行为，与实际数显不同符号的$Λ$表现不一致。模型显示出波动压行为，每段时间内压强符号变化，为反物质压力提供可能解释。反物质压力和负$Λ$在加速问题上的潜在机制被重新审视。

Motivation: 研究者希望探索时变$Λ$对宇宙学的影响，尤其是在避免未来奇点和解释加速现象方面。

Method: 研究者提出了一个基于Hubble参数$H$的时间依赖负$Λ$的模型，并通过比较不同$Λ$条件下模型的表现来分析和解释结果。

Result: 通过这个负$Λ$模型，研究者发现了一个没有未来奇点且有效的宇宙描述。对比正值和零值$Λ$，负$Λ$模型显示出波动压行为和压强符号的变化。这为反物质压力提供了可能的解释，并重新审视了负$Λ$与加速问题的关系。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解反物质压力和负$Λ$机制提供了新的视角，手工可能是一个有趣的方向。

Abstract: The AdS vacuum corresponds to a negative cosmological constant $Λ$. While it is well-motivated theoretically, There has always been controversy over its actual existence. The AdS-dS transition is corresponding to a sign switching $Λ$. We have proposed an ansatz for a negative time-varying cosmological constant $Λ(H)$ as a function of Hubble parameter $H$, and used it in constructing a periodic model with no future singularity in a scale-invariance gravity. With the proposed Ansatz for negative $Λ$, The model leads to a physically acceptable cosmic description, while we get unphysical parameters with the positive and zero values of $Λ$. The model reveals a Quintom behavior with a sign flipping of cosmic pressure during each period. The non-conventional mechanism of negative $Λ$ that are expected to address the late-time acceleration has been revisited.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditionally, the embedding procedure for spherically symmetric spacetimes has been restricted to the equatorial plane $θ= π/2$. This conventional approach, however, encounters a fundamental limitation: not every spherically symmetric geometry admits an isometric embedding of its equatorial slice into three-dimensional Euclidean space. When such embeddings are not possible, the standard geometric intuition becomes inapplicable. In this work, we generalize the embedding procedure to slices with arbitrary polar angles $θ\neq π/2$, thereby extending the visualization and analysis of spacetimes beyond the reach of traditional methods.
  The formalism is applied to Schwarzschild-like wormholes and to a generalized Minkowski spacetime with angular deficit or excess, which are particularly relevant since their equatorial slices cannot be consistently embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In these cases, we identify the explicit constraints on the radial coordinate, polar angle, and geometric parameters required to guarantee consistent embeddings into three-dimensional Euclidean space.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We construct the exact stellar configurations that contain an ordinary perfect-fluid matter that interacts minimally with a condensate of gravitons with distinct pressure conditions on the surface. We propose vanishing transverse pressure on the surface for, namely graviton condensate type 1 and vanishing radial pressure on the surface for type 2. The condition for the radial pressure of type 1 requires the existence of a thin shell that will balance the pressure discontinuity while for type 2, the discontinuity on transverse pressure does not require the additional thin shell. It is found that the Buchdahl inequality of the resulting stellar configurations depends on the parameter related to the graviton condensate, such that we can find the ultra-compact regime of the stellar models. Moreover, the echo time and echo frequency within the ultra-compact regime are computed. At the same compactness, it is found that the presence of the graviton condensate will delay the gravitational echoes for type 2 and will expedite the gravitational echoes for type 1 compared to constant density star, $τ_{echo2}>τ_{CDS}>τ_{echo1}$. Furthermore, the gravitational perturbation of a massless scalar wave is also investigated to support these results. These results could open more opportunities for the observational study of graviton in the near future, mostly from the compact astrophysical objects.

Abstract: The first-order out of equilibrium correction to the distribution function, obtained by implementing the projection method for the perturbed relativistic Boltzmann equation using the Chapman-Enskog method, is generalized in order to explicitly include the freedom of choice for thermodynamic frame and representation. It is shown how this procedure leads to general constitutive equations that couple the thermodynamic fluxes to all forces including a weak external electromagnetic field. Special cases of the resulting force-flux relations have been shown to lead to physically sound theories for relativistic fluids.

Abstract: We study the scattering of gravitational waves by axion domain walls in teleparallel gravity with the Nieh-Yan term. Since a domain wall causes the parity violation, the transmitted gravitational waves also exhibit the parity violation. We calculate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves. It turns out that gravitational waves after going through the domain wall could be chiral. Remarkably, the degree of circular polarization does not depend on the tension of the domain wall.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum-gravitational effective actions with higher-derivative and non-local operators are expected to regularize the singularities of general relativity. Here we focus on quasi-local Einstein-Weyl gravity and obtain a classification of Frobenius solutions in static spherical symmetry. In contrast to local Einstein-Weyl gravity, and more generally quadratic gravity, we find that the quasi-local theory admits only regular solutions at the radial core. In addition, we find asymptotic $1/r^{6}$-corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry at large radial distances. Other solution classes around generic expansion points describe Schwarzschild-like and other types of horizons, as well as symmetric and non-symmetric wormhole throats.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了超大质量比双黑洞合并的引力波信号，使用Kerr-Newman几何模拟时空，发现对电荷到质量比率的约束比单独依靠内测 Binary black holes with asymmetric masses are key targets for gravitational-wave detectors. The study extends Kerr to Kerr-Newman spacetimes for better constraint of non-Kerr features. Source material provides detailed analysis of the post-inspiral dynamics and their implications on charge-to-mass ratio estimation. Observational prospects for future detectors like Einstein Telescope are promising. Skip details for brevity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into binary black hole mergers is crucial for understanding strong-field gravity and testing general relativity predictions in extreme conditions. The use of advanced spacetime models (Kerr-Newman) allows for more accurate waveform modeling and tighter constraints on deviations from Kerr geometry, which could provide insights into the nature of spacetime itself.

Method: The research employs numerical relativity techniques to simulate binary black hole mergers in Kerr-Newman spacetimes. The study uses the Dudley-Finley approximation to decouple gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations, simplifying the analysis while maintaining relevance to real astrophysical scenarios.

Result: The key result is that modeling the post-inspiral phase of the merger significantly improves constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the black hole. In the case of intermediate-mass mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, the improved constraints can reach the order of $10^{-3}$, surpassing existing bounds from previous observations such as GW150914. This provides a more robust method for detecting and characterizing non-Kerr features in gravitational wave signals.

Conclusion: The study advances our ability to model gravitational wave signals in non-Kerr spacetimes and offers a promising pathway to detect deviations from general relativity in the context of future gravitational wave observations. This work lays the groundwork for more comprehensive waveform models and opens new avenues for exploring the nature of spacetime in extreme astrophysical settings.

Abstract: Binary black hole mergers with asymmetric component masses are key targets for both third-generation ground-based and future space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, offering unique access to the strong-field dynamics of gravity. The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: These lecture notes develop polariton fluids of light as programmable simulators of quantum fields on tailored curved spacetimes, with emphasis on acoustic horizons and the Hawking effect. After introducing exciton-polariton physics in semiconductor microcavities, we detail the theoretical tools to study the mean field and the quantum hydrodynamics of this driven-dissipative quantum system. We derive the mapping to relativistic field theories and cast horizon physics as a pseudounitary stationary scattering problem. We present the Gaussian optics circuit that describes observables and fixes detection weights for the horizon modes in near- and far-field measurements. We provide a practical experimental toolkit (phase-imprinted flows, coherent pump-probe spectroscopy, balanced and homodyne detection) and a step-by-step workflow to extract amplification, quadrature squeezing, and entanglement among correlations. Finally, we discuss the potential of this platform to investigate open questions in quantum field theory in curved spacetime, such as near horizon effects and quasinormal modes, as well as other phenomena universal to rotating geometries, from rotational superradiance to dynamical instabilities. We further outline the interplay between rotational superradiance and the Hawking effect, proposing to spatially resolve measurements as a roadmap for `dumb hole spectroscopy' and the study of entanglement dynamics in curved spacetimes.

Method: The notes introduce the basics of BECs, their excitations, and how curved spacetime can emerge from their dynamics. Mathematical methods include analytical solutions and numerical simulations applied specifically to black hole phenomena.

Result: Readers gain explicit models of phenomena such as superradiance and Hawking radiation, along with the tools to simulate and analyze them using BEC systems.

Conclusion: This approach bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity, offering a tangible way to study complex spacetime phenomena in the lab.

Abstract: Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.

*A. A. Araújo Filho,Iarley P. Lobo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper examines the thermodynamic behavior of an axially symmetric black hole in a non-commutative framework but suffers from computational inconsistencies due to incorrect event horizon and surface gravity calculations, invalidating the results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper attempts to analyze the thermodynamic behavior of a specific type of black hole in a non-commutative framework, which could have implications for our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity.

Method: The paper calculates the event horizon and surface gravity of an axially symmetric black hole by comparing it to a spherically symmetric case, using methods from general relativity and thermodynamics in a non-commutative framework.

Result: The paper finds that the calculations for the event horizon and surface gravity are incorrect, leading to invalid thermodynamic results for the axially symmetric black hole in a non-commutative framework.

Conclusion: The results presented in the paper are flawed and require reexamination using more accurate methods that account for the axial symmetry rather than assuming spherical symmetry.

Abstract: A recent study [Annals Phys. 455 (2023) 169394, e-Print: 2204.01901 [gr-qc]] examined the thermodynamic behavior of an axially symmetric black hole within a non-commutative framework that mimics the effect of an angular momentum. However, the analysis presents notable computational inconsistencies. In that analysis, the event horizon was miscalculated, and this error propagated through and compromised all subsequent results. In addition, an incorrect definition of surface gravity was used -- the spherically symmetric case was invoked for an axially symmetric spacetime -- rendering the thermodynamic results invalid. In other words, all the results presented in the paper require a thorough reexamination.

Abstract: A discrete class of privileged reference frames in a closed universe with identical equations of motion for physical degrees of freedom was found. A representation of the quantum state of the universe in a privileged reference frame was obtained as a Euclidean functional integral with no-boundary conditions. The boundary condition at the Pole, in addition to the smoothness conditions, is the infinite asymptotic behavior of the Hubble parameter. This makes it possible to regularize the functional integral by changing the sign of the expansion energy of the universe. The proposed construction also allows for the addition of a non-zero proper mass of the universe.

Abstract: Black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nontrivial scalar or matter fields - commonly known as hairy black holes - have attracted significant interest in recent years. They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources. Interestingly, even with the present precision of the data, the Relativistic Precession Model seems to be less suitable compared to the Tidal Disruption Model for the sources GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226. The implications are discussed.

Abstract: This review examines the role of differential forms, Pfaffian systems, and hypersurfaces in general relativity. These mathematical constructions provide the essential tools for general relativity, in which the curvature of spacetime;described by the Einstein field equations;is most elegantly formulated using the Cartan calculus of differential forms. Another important subject in this discussion is the notion of conformal geometry, where the relevant invariants of a metric are characterized by Elie Cartan's normal conformal connection. The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable. Defined by a central Pfaffian system, this formulation allows the entire spacetime geometry to be reconstructed from a single scalar function, $Z$, whose level surfaces are null.

Abstract: We characterize spin initial data sets that saturate the BPS bound in the asymptotically AdS setting. This includes both gravitational waves and rotating black holes in higher dimensions, and we establish a sharp dimension threshold in each case. A key ingredient in our argument is a theorem providing a general criterion for when an imaginary Killing spinor of mixed causal type can be replaced by one that is strictly timelike or null. Moreover, in analogy with the minimal surface method, we demonstrate that spinors can be used to construct a codimension-$2$ slicing.

Abstract: A set of 3+1 equations for stochastic inflation incorporating all metric and scalar matter degrees of freedom, first presented in previous work, are re-derived in a gauge invariant manner. We then present numerical implementations of these stochastic equations, cast in the BSSN formulation of Numerical Relativity, demonstrating their efficacy in both a slow-roll and an ultra slow-roll scenario. We find the evolution is correctly reproduced for all the dynamical variables, and the energy and momentum constraints are well-satisfied. This demonstrates that the stochastic equations are theoretically and numerically robust and ready to be applied to a wider inflationary landscape. Our simulations result in real space realizations of the fully non-linear stochastic dynamics with gradient information retained. As a generalisation of standard stochastic inflation, inflationary numerical relativity and lattice cosmology, this work opens up the possibility for reliable predictions of non-perturbative phenomena and provides precise initial conditions for subsequent cosmological eras.

Abstract: We perform searches for gravitational wave memory in the data of two major Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments located in Europe and Australia. Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the primary sources of gravitational waves in PTA experiments. We develop and carry out the first search for late inspirals and mergers of these sources based on full numerical relativity waveforms with null (nonlinear) gravitational wave memory. Additionally, we search for generic bursts of null gravitational wave memory, exploring possibilities of reducing the computational cost of these searches through kernel density and normalizing flow approximation of the posteriors. We rule out the mergers of SMBHBs with a chirp mass of 10^10 Solar Mass up to 700 Mpc over 18 years of observation at 95% credibility. We rule out the observation of generic displacement memory bursts with strain amplitudes > 10^-14 in brief periods of the observation time but across the sky, or over the whole observation time but for certain preferred sky positions, at 95%$credibility.

Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear tidal response of relativistic neutron stars by computing the fully relativistic, static, quadratic Love numbers. Using both the worldline effective field theory for extended gravitating bodies and second-order perturbations of relativistic stellar models, we derive the nonlinear tidal deformation induced by an external gravito-electric tidal field to quadratic order. Through a suitable matching procedure, we provide for the first time the leading nonlinear tidal corrections to the conservative dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of binary systems. Quadratic Love numbers are enhanced more than the linear ones in the small-compactness limit. Because of this, despite entering the gravitational-wave phase at 8th post-Newtonian (PN) order, the leading quadratic Love number can be as important as the next-to-next-to-leading order linear tidal correction, which enters at 7th PN order, and is larger than the subleading point-particle contribution entering at 4th PN order. In particular, quadratic Love numbers can be as large as ~10% of the linear Love numbers in the late inspiral phase. Our approach provides a framework to also compute the (subleading) nonlinear effects induced by magnetic tidal fields and higher multipole moments, and sets the foundations for incorporating nonlinear tidal effects in high-precision gravitational-wave modeling.

Abstract: We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.

Abstract: The growing number of gravitational wave (GW) detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW detectors have enabled precision tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \leq \ell \leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations.

Abstract: Most particles in nature are unstable, manifesting as resonances in scattering processes. Using analyticity and unitarity, we show nonperturbatively that resonances, defined as poles on higher Riemann sheets of scattering amplitudes, share basic properties with stable particles: (i) Universality, that a resonance generically appears in every S-matrix element; and (ii) Factorization, that amplitudes factorize on resonance poles. Our framework applies in any spacetime dimension and across arbitrarily many two-particle cuts, including cases where the kinematic Riemann surface becomes infinitely sheeted. Importantly, we find that resonance data (mass, width, couplings, and sheet index) are fully encoded on the physical sheet, where causality can impose additional constraints. These results are relevant for extending S-matrix bootstrap studies beyond elastic scattering.

For $\mathcal{E}$ exponentially smaller than any hard scale, they also satisfy unitarity and their associated cross sections reproduce the inclusive, infrared-finite cross sections of ordinary amplitudes. These properties make $\mathcal{M}_{\mathcal{E}}$ suitable for deriving infrared-safe positivity bounds on effective field theories in the presence of long-range forces even in $D=4$. As an illustration, we present explicit bounds in the low-energy theory of pions coupled to electromagnetism and gravity.

Abstract: We discuss the symmetry aspects of quantum field theory in global four-dimensional de Sitter spacetime linked to $SO(1,4)$ isometries. For the unitary irreducible representations relevant to elementary particles, we obtain explicit transformation laws for the symmetry generators acting on one-particle states in a basis adapted to the $SU(2) \times SU(2)'$ decomposition of the Hilbert space. Using these results, we derive the corresponding Ward identities and demonstrate how global spacetime symmetries constrain de Sitter scattering amplitudes. We show that the Poincaré algebra and flat-space Ward identities are recovered in the large-momentum limit.

Motivation: Two-loop calculations are essential for precision predictions in particle physics, so understanding the associated geometries is important.

Method: The authors used the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme with D-dimensional integrals and analyzed topologies with sector functions via the Baikov representation.

Result: The paper identifies various geometric structures like Riemann spheres, elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves, and K3 surfaces arising from the integrals. Notably, they find a smooth Del Pezzo surface of degree 2 for the first time in Feynman integrals, which is a significant geometric feature in two-loop calculations.

Conclusion: The findings reveal the rich geometric landscape of two-loop Feynman integrals, expanding our understanding of modern QFT techniques.

Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman-integral geometries at two-loop order in four-dimensional Quantum Field Theory with standard quadratic propagators. Concretely, we consider a finite basis of integrals in the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme, i.e. with $D$-dimensional loop momenta and four-dimensional external momenta, which belong to 79 independent topologies, or sectors. Then, we analyze the leading singularities of the integrals in those sectors for generic values of the masses and momenta, using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation. Aside from the Riemann sphere, we find that elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and 3 as well as K3 surfaces occur. Moreover, we find for the first time in Feynman integrals a smooth and non-degenerate Del Pezzo surface of degree 2, a particular Fano variety known to be rationalizable, resulting in a curve of geometric genus 3. These geometries determine the space of functions relevant for Quantum Field Theories at two-loop order, including in the Standard Model.

Abstract: We extensively explore the connections between time-like entanglement and non-hermitian density matrices in quantum many-body systems. We classify setups where we encounter non-hermitian density matrices into two types: one is due to causal influences under unitary evolutions, and the other is due to non-unitary evolutions in non-hermitian systems. We provide various examples of these setups including interacting harmonic oscillators, two dimensional conformal field theories and holographic dualities. In them, we compute the time-like entanglement entropy and imagitivity, which measures how much density matrices are non-hermitian. In both two classes, typical holographic examples are given by traversable AdS wormholes. We explain how causal influences in a wormhole dual to a pair of non-hermitian quantum systems is possible even without interactions between them. We argue that to realize a traversable wormhole we need not only ordinary quantum entanglement but also time-like entanglement.

### [26] ["Filtering" CFTs at large N: Euclidean Wormholes, Closed Universes, and Black Hole Interiors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13807)
*Hong Liu*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper points out incomplete aspects of the large-N holographic dictionary and its relation to gravitational path integrals, particularly the role of Euclidean wormholes and factorization issues. It proposes a novel large-N filter to address erratic N-dependence in CFT observables, offering a mechanism to define gravitational averages and semiclassical wormhole contributions. Additionally, it suggests that this filter could lead to a framework allowing for more diverse Lorentzian spacetime structures, implying the quantum volatility of closed universes, black hole interiors, and entangled spacetime-exterior systems. Observers in such scenarios may experience different levels of knowledge about these exotic spacetime features depending on their perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between holographic principles and gravitational phenomena, particularly in the context of large-N limits and quantum gravity effects such as wormholes and factorization puzzles, is a key motivation in theoretical physics. The paper addresses these challenges by proposing a new conceptual framework.

Method: The authors analyze the limitations of the existing large-N holographic dictionary by examining its incompatibility with gravitational path integrals. They introduce a large-N filter to address specific N-dependent issues in CFT observable mapping. They also leverage duality arguments across different spacetime scenarios to propose their framework.

Result: The paper's main outcomes include a proposed large-N filter that addresses issues of N-dependence in CFT, a reinterpretation of gravitational averages, a resolution of factorization puzzles via wormhole contributions, and implications for the emergence of diverse spacetime structures. It also suggests that certain spacetime features may be quantum volatile and that observer perspectives affect their ability to infer such features.

Conclusion: The work offers significant insights into the interplay between holography, quantum gravity, and spacetime structure. It identifies a new conceptual tool for understanding gravitational phenomena and the emergence of diverse spacetime configurations, while highlighting the quantum nature of spacetime features and the role of observer perspectives in influencing knowledge of such features.

Abstract: Despite its successes, the large-$N$ holographic dictionary remains incomplete. Key features of gravitational path integrals--most notably Euclidean wormholes and the associated failure of factorization--lack a clear interpretation in the standard large-$N$ framework. A related challenge is the possibility of erratic $N$-dependence in CFT observables, behavior with no evident semiclassical gravitational counterpart.
  We argue that these puzzles point to a missing ingredient in the dictionary: a large-$N$ filter. This filter projects out the erratic $N$-dependence of CFT quantities when mapping them to semiclassical bulk physics, providing an intrinsic boundary definition of gravitational "averages." It also offers a boundary explanation of wormhole contributions and a boundary prediction of their amplitudes, thereby giving a natural resolution of the factorization puzzle. In addition, we derive an infinite tower of inequalities constraining wormhole amplitudes and argue that internal wormholes do not induce random couplings in the low-energy effective theory.
  Beyond resolving factorization, the large-$N$ filter supplies a generalized framework from which richer Lorentzian spacetime structures can emerge, including closed universes and black hole interiors. We argue that, as a consequence of erratic large-$N$ behavior, both closed universes and black hole interiors are quantum volatile, and that an AdS spacetime entangled with a baby universe is likewise quantum volatile. This volatility may allow an observer in AdS to infer the existence of the baby universe, whereas for an infalling observer, the ability to make measurements near a black hole horizon may become fundamentally limited--even if they may not live long enough to notice.

Abstract: We study the generalized hypergeometric systems, in the sense of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky, associated with one-loop Feynman integrals, and determine when their rank is independent of space-time dimension and propagator powers. This is equivalent to classifying when the associated affine semigroup ring is Cohen-Macaulay. For massive one-loop integrals, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for Cohen-Macaulayness, generalizing previous results on normality for these rings. We show that for Feynman integrals, the Cohen-Macaulay property is fully determined by an integer linear program built from the Newton polytope of the integrand and find a graphical description of its solutions. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient condition for Cohen-Macaulayness of general one-loop integrals.

Abstract: We argue that the electromagnetic $θ$-term is a physical parameter of the Standard Model coupled to gravity. Specifically, in the context of 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory we show that there exist Euclidean field configurations that have finite action, are asymptotically flat, and feature non-zero electromagnetic second Chern number. These ``gravitational Abelian instantons" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $θ$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $θ$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes.

Abstract: The local physics of light scalar fields in de Sitter space is well described by classical random walks, as expressed through the framework of Stochastic Inflation. Recent work has clarified how this formalism arises from quantum field theory (QFT) and the renormalization group (RG), allowing for corrections to this formalism to be determined order by order. Yet, this description is incomplete. For example, the quantum dynamics of these fields are expected to become important when determining the tail of the probability distribution for the fluctuations. In this paper, we develop the understanding of fields in de Sitter as a quantum walk in order to bridge the gap between the classical and quantum description. We use the framework of exact RG to calculate the evolution equation for the reduced density matrix of the long wavelength fields. This master equation provides the direct map from light fields to models of quantum walks. We show how to reduce the master equation to Stochastic Inflation, and provide a new understanding of how the higher-order corrections arise. In the process, we demonstrate that divergences and secular growth in de Sitter, for both light and heavy fields, can be absorbed by (dynamical) renormalization.

Abstract: Vacuum bubbles, formed in first order phase transitions, have important implications for cosmology. In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of quantum gravity for models of a scalar singlet coupled to the metric. Such models describe inflation for early cosmology and dynamical dark energy for late cosmology. We work within the ''variable gravity approximation" keeping in the effective action an arbitrary field dependence for terms with up to two derivatives. We focus on the scaling solutions of the gauge invariant functional flow equation which describes the dependence of the effective action on a momentum or length scale. The existence of such solutions is required for the ultraviolet fixed point defining an ultraviolet complete renormalizable quantum field theory for gravity. Our findings strengthen the case for the presence of a ''dilaton quantum gravity fixed point" for which the Planck mass increases proportional to the scalar field for large field values. This fixed point is different from the extended Reuter fixed point with a flat scalar potential and field-independent Planck mass, which is also seen in our setting.

Abstract: In the exploration of the vast string landscape, we provide new analytic solutions of non-SUSY black branes in 10-D heterotic supergravity which exhibit a phase transition. Our black brane solutions carry two kinds of gauge charges but still are exact, which extends the recent developments in classification of heterotic branes. The solutions offer a novel method to embed previously known noncritical 2-D or 3-D solutions to the critical dimensions. Furthermore, by performing a perturbative analysis of the non-Abelian gauge field on this exact background, we analytically find that as the temperature decreases, a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to a dynamical instability accompanied by gauge field condensation. This instability embodies a phase transition of black branes in heterotic supergravity, and analytically predicts the existence of unknown black hole solutions to be unveiled. Our results suggest that phase transition phenomena can be used to explore and analyze the phase structure of black hole solutions, for systematically discovering and classifying stringy black holes.

Abstract: We derive the general form of the effective equations governing black hole dynamics in the limit of a large number of dimensions $D$. These split into a universal \emph{soap-bubble} embedding condition for stationary configurations and a set of nonlinear dynamical evolution equations describing near-horizon fluctuations of $O(1/D)$ amplitude over horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$. We obtain these equations in full generality, including arbitrary asymptotic sources in the near-horizon region, and we show that they form a parabolic system with a well-posed initial value problem. To connect the various approaches to large-$D$ black hole dynamics, we also show that both the embedding and dynamical equations can be derived from the covariant membrane formalism. We clarify the intrinsic scope of the large-$D$ approach, emphasizing that it yields a well-posed dynamical evolution only on horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$, which is the range where the most relevant horizon dynamics occur. Our results highlight the versatility of these effective theories for studying a wide class of black hole phenomena.

Specifically, we study a scalar field in an asymmetric double well potential during inflation, coupled to environmental degrees of freedom provided either by heavy spectator fields or by short-wavelength modes as they cross out the Hubble scale. This setup enables a systematic derivation of both Markovian and non-Markovian master equations, along with their stochastic unravelings, which we solve numerically. We find that, while decoherence is essential for suppressing quantum interference between vacua, its impact on the relative vacuum populations is limited. Fields heavier than the Hubble scale relax adiabatically toward the true vacuum with high probability, while lighter fields exhibit non-adiabatic enhancements of false-vacuum occupation. Once the system has decohered, quantum tunneling between vacua becomes strongly suppressed, effectively locking the system into the stochastically selected local minimum. This ``cosmic lockdown'' mechanism is a manifestation of the quantum Zeno effect: environmental monitoring stabilizes enhanced false-vacuum occupation for light fields by preventing them from tunneling.

### [36] [Gravitational charges and radiation in asymptotically locally de Sitter spacetimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14243)
*Aaron Poole,Kostas Skenderis,Marika Taylor*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper discusses gravitational charges and radiation in four-dimensional asymptotically locally de Sitter (AldS) spacetimes, showing how the variational problem is well-posed under certain conditions and specifying conformal classes up to three-dimensional diffeomorphisms. Radiation occurs when the conformal class is non-trivial. Gravitational charges are conserved or satisfy flux-balance laws based on asymptotic bulk diffeomorphisms. The authors also introduce invariant quantities and apply their formalism to exact solutions like the Robinson-Trautman-dS class, finding conserved charges and monotonic charges, including the Bondi mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors were motivated by the study of gravitational radiation and its implications on spacetime geometry in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, drawing parallels with the AdS/CFT correspondence by incorporating conformal boundaries and covariant counterterms to handle UV divergences in holographic renormalization.

Method: The authors used a combination of Noether's theorem and covariant phase space methods to derive their results, applying these techniques to exact solutions to demonstrate the existence of conserved and monotonic charges.

Result: The key results include the conditions under which the variational problem is well-posed, the behavior of gravitational radiation, the properties of gravitational charges under bulk diffeomorphisms, and the identification of conserved or flux-balance quantities depending on the conformal class at infinity. The application to exact solutions like the Robinson-Trautman-dS class confirms the existence of conserved charges and monotonic quantities, including the Bondi mass.

Conclusion: This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of gravitational charges and radiation in four-dimensional AldS spacetimes, establishing conditions for well-posedness, characterizing radiation, and elucidating the behavior of gravitational charges through Noether's theorem and covariant methods. The findings are supported by exact solutions, demonstrating the existence of conserved and monotonic quantities that are significant for understanding gravitational dynamics in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive discussion of gravitational charges and radiation in four-dimensional asymptotically locally de Sitter (AldS) spacetimes. Such spacetimes have compact spatial sections and possess spacelike past and future infinities, $\mathscr{I}^\pm$. We show that the variational problem is well-posed if one specifies a conformal class up to three-dimensional diffeomorpshims at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$, provided one adds at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ suitable local terms. These are analogues of the AdS covariant counterterms of holographic renormalisation. Radiation is possible only when the conformal class at infinity is non-trivial. Bulk diffeomorphisms that asymptote to conformal Killing vectors at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ lead to gravitational charges that are conserved under radial translations, while transformations that asymptote to a general three-dimensional vector imply that the gravitational charges satisfy flux-balance laws. We also present quantities that are invariant under temporal translations, if gravitational flux is absent, but otherwise satisfy flux-balance laws. We derive these results using first principles application of Noether's method as well as covariant phase space methods. We apply our formalism to several exact solutions, including the Robinson-Trautman-dS class, which we use to demonstrate the existence of conserved charges even in the absence of asymptotic conformal Killing vectors and the existence of monotonic charges, including the Bondi mass.

Abstract: This work aims to develop a global formulation for ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic/projective anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace $\text{AdS}^{4|8}\times S^2 \simeq \text{AdS}^{4|8}\times {\mathbb C}P^1$ that allows for a simple action of superconformal (and hence AdS isometry) transformations. First of all, we provide an alternative supertwistor description of the ${\cal N}$-extended AdS superspace in four dimensions, AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$, which corresponds to a realisation of the connected component $\mathsf{OSp}_0({\cal N}|4; {\mathbb R})$ of the AdS isometry supergroup as $\mathsf{SU}(2,2 |{\cal N}) \bigcap \mathsf{OSp} ({\cal N}| 4; {\mathbb C})$. The proposed realisation yields the following properties: (i) AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ is an open domain of the compactified ${\cal N}$-extended Minkowski superspace, $\overline{\mathbb M}^{4|4\cal N}$; (ii) the infinitesimal ${\cal N}$-extended superconformal transformations naturally act on AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$; and (iii) the isometry transformations of AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ are described by those superconformal transformations which obey a certain constraint. The obtained results for AdS$^{4|4\cal N}$ are then applied to develop a supertwistor formulation for an AdS flag superspace $ \text{AdS}^{4|8} \times {\mathbb F}_1(2)$ that we identify with the ${\cal N}=2$ harmonic/projective AdS superspace. This construction makes it possible to read off the superconformal and AdS isometry transformations acting on the analytic subspace of the harmonic superspace.

*Sudhaker Upadhyay,Alexander Reshetnyak,Pavel Moshin,Ricardo Castro*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper explores how holographic consistency conditions in holography, specifically the convexity of the CFT spectrum, ANEC, and modular bootstrap, map onto Swampland constraints in the bulk. It argues that holographic principles offer a geometric understanding of Swampland bounds, particularly concerning scalar field potentials and the absence of long-lived de Sitter vacua. Additionally, it discusses how bulk locality in AdS/CFT provides evidence that the Swampland Conjectures may stem from deeper holographic consistency conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Swampland Program seeks to delineate consistent EFTs with quantum gravity UV completions, while holography, especially AdS/CFT, provides a non-perturbative approach to quantum gravity. This exploration aims to connect these frameworks through holographic consistency conditions.

Method: The paper employs a comparative analysis of holographic principles and Swampland Conjectures, focusing on the mapping of CFT properties to bulk constraints. It draws on AdS/CFT correspondence and key bulk consistency conditions such as convexity, ANEC, and modular bootstrap.

Result: The paper concludes that holographic principles geometrically realize Swampland bounds, particularly in constraints related to scalar potentials and de Sitter vacua. It also suggests that bulk locality in AdS/CFT supports the idea that Swampland Conjectures are manifestations of deeper holographic consistency.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of how holographic consistency conditions translate into Swampland constraints, offering geometric interpretations and evidence of underlying holographic principles guiding these Swampland bounds.

Abstract: The Swampland Program aims to delineate the space of consistent low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) that admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do not. In parallel, holography, and particularly the AdS/CFT correspondence, offers a non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. In this paper, we explore the Swampland Conjectures through the lens of holography, focusing on how holographic consistency conditions, such as the convexity of the conformal field theory (CFT) spectrum, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), and the modular bootstrap, map onto Swampland constraints in the bulk. We argue that the holographic principle provides a geometric realization of Swampland bounds, particularly on scalar field potentials and the absence of long-lived de Sitter vacua. Finally, we discuss how the emergent bulk locality in AdS/CFT provides evidence that the Swampland conjectures may themselves be manifestations of deeper holographic consistency conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit abelian S-duality in the context of higher gauge theory. By using a specific crossed module a set of transformations arise, which are known as the "thin" and "fat" transformations. The "fat" transformations are the ones introduced by hand to construct the S-dual theory. By utilizing crossed modules and higher gauge theory, we arrive at transformations referred to by some as "third-type transformations", giving these transformations a geometric interpretation, as transformations of a local 2-connection in a 2-principal bundle. This approach opens a new perspective to understand S-duality in non-abelian gauge theories through higher gauge theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.

Abstract: The ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regime of gravity has recently emerged as a fertile framework for exploring holography, non-Lorentzian symmetries, and geometric limit of General Relativity. In this letter, we establish the presence of a non-vanishing torsion within three-dimensional Carrollian gravity by constructing the Carrollian Mielke-Baekler (C-MB) gravity theory in its Chern-Simons formulation, obtained as the ultra-relativistic limit of the relativistic Mielke-Baekler model. The resulting C-MB theory features non-zero temporal torsion and curvature, together with spatial curvature, providing the most general three-dimensional Carrollian gravity model with these properties. Several known ultra-relativistic gravity theories arise as particular limits of this framework, highlighting its unifying character.

Abstract: In-in correlators are the basic observables in cosmology and are traditionally computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this paper we revisit this formalism for photons, gluons, and gravitons coupled to scalars in four dimensional de Sitter space and provide a novel treatment of boundary gauge-fixing of the underlying path integral. We also derive effective actions in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space whose Feynman rules compute the in-in correlators of these theories in de Sitter space, generalising the shadow formalism recently obtained for scalar theories. We illustrate this formalism in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop, demonstrating its relative simplicity compared to other approaches. Moreover, we initiate the study of color/kinematics duality and the double copy for in-in correlators using dressing rules which uplift flat space Feynman diagrams to de Sitter space.

Abstract: We present a general method for engineering qudits through individually addressable transitions between Zeeman sublevels, achieved by combining a large linear Zeeman shift with a state-dependent light shift. This approach lifts the degeneracy between adjacent states while simultaneously tuning their energy splittings into the radio-frequency (RF) domain, enabling coherent manipulation within the Zeeman manifold using experimentally accessible drive frequencies. As a concrete realization, we investigate the implementation of an $SU(5)$ \emph{quintet} encoded in the Zeeman sublevels of the long-lived $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of neutral $\mathrm{^{88}Sr}$ atoms confined in far-detuned, $σ^{-}$-polarized optical tweezers. Using realistic experimental parameters, we numerically demonstrate full control of the \emph{quintet} manifold, including initialization into a specific $SU(5)$ basis state via a multi-photon transfer, coherent state- and site-selective single-qudit rotations driven by RF fields, and fast state-selective optical readout. Our simulations predict state-preparation fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ within $\sim 1~μ\rm{s}$, single-qudit gate fidelities of $\mathcal{F} \simeq 0.99$ with $π$-pulse durations of $\sim 2.5~μ\rm{s}$, and fast destructive imaging with durations below $10~μ\rm{s}$. These results establish a broadly applicable framework for high-fidelity control of Zeeman sublevel-encoded qudits and highlight the $^3\mathrm{P}_2$ manifold in strontium as a promising platform for scalable qudit-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: A generalization of the Euler's elastic problem, i.e., finding a stationary configuration (planar elastica) of the Bernoulli's thin ideal elastic rod with boundary conditions defined through fixed endpoints and/or tangents at the endpoints, for the chosen nonlocal differential constitutive stress-strain relation (i.e., nonlocal theory of elasticity) is considered. In the classical (local) Euler-Bernoulli's beam model, the general solutions of the governing equations (that are inhomogeneous but linear) for bending moments and shear forces in the case of large deformations can be obtained using the Jacobi elliptic functions and incomplete elliptic integrals. For the discussed nonlocal toy differential model, the general solutions of the governing equations (that are this time nonlinear) can also be expressed in the parametric form through the linear combinations of all three incomplete elliptic integrals. As further research, we plan to apply some boundary conditions (clamped, simply supported, etc.) for the obtained nonlocal general solutions in order to compare them to the local solutions for the corresponding boundary value problems.

Motivation: Understanding the impact of rotor rigidity on thermal unbalance for improved machine design.

Method: Experimental analysis of rotor systems under thermal effects.

Result: Rigid rotors (short) show enhanced thermal unbalance compared to flexible rotors (long).

Conclusion: Thermal unbalance significantly affects rigid rotors, and a sufficient start-up time is crucial for stable operation.

Abstract: The present work presents the experimental analyses of a rigid (short) and a flexible (long) rotor subject to thermal unbalance effects. The rotors are supported by a ball bearing and by a cylindrical journal bearing. The differential heating generated in the journal bearing is responsible for the thermal unbalance. The results obtained with the short rotor at 7 krpm showed an increase in the synchronous amplitudes but slight phase changes before stabilization. The pronounced hysteresis of the synchronous amplitudes obtained during coast-down proved that the amplitude increase is due to the thermal unbalance. The results obtained for the long rotor at 6.6 krpm showed the same stabilized response when start-up was performed in 180___s. However, an instability leading to journal bearing contact was triggered when the start-up time was decreased to 80___s. The presented experimental results are the synchronous amplitudes and phases, the mean temperatures, and the maximum temperature differences of the journal and of the bearing and the phase lags between the high spot and the hot spot.

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures combining two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets and semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer highly promising opportunities for tailoring 2D magnetism through interfacial proximity effects, enabling unique physical phenomena inaccessible in 3D systems and achieving functionalities beyond conventional spintronics. However, current fabrication of vdW heterostructures still relies heavily on the manual stacking of exfoliated 2D flakes, leading to critical challenges in scalability, interfacial quality, thickness control and device integration. This work reports on the realization of all-epitaxial, high-quality Fe5-xGeTe2(FGT)/WSe2 heterostructures exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and room-temperature ferromagnetism. The FGT/WSe2 system demonstrates temperature-driven magnetic transitions, higher-order PMA contributions and large anisotropic magnetoresistance, highlighting sublattice-specific contributions to magnetic and transport properties. Notably, the FGT/WSe2 heterostructures display unconventional physical phenomena, including thickness- and temperature-dependent sign reversal of exchange bias, a reversed thickness trend in the unconventional Hall effect, and a non-monotonic PMA-thickness dependence. These anomalies indicate pronounced interfacial contributions arising from proximity effects enhanced by epitaxial interface quality. Collectively, this study provides deep insights into the magnetic and transport properties of FGT/WSe2 vdW heterostructures, establishing a scalable platform for exploring emergent 2D physics and advancing next-generation 2D spintronic technologies.

Abstract: The propagation of second sound, and more broadly the ballistic transport of heat, is of central importance in heat dissipation from electronic devices at very short length and time scales. Specifically, there is an interest in the practical implications of violations of Fourier's law. Recently, we have developed a simulation approach based on thermal-response functions that is appropriate for elucidating physics beyond the diffusive regime, including time-dependent sources and second-sound propagation. The methods are applied to free-standing graphene simulated using molecular-dynamics (MD) with empirical potentials. The simulations predict a strong second-sound signal at T=300K for length scales of at least L=68.1nm. It is demonstrated that the second-sound dissipation time is determined primarily by decoherence that emerges from the details of the phonon band structure. It is also shown that the decay time for second sound depends sensitively on the length scale that characterizes the thermal excitation. This is in contrast with theories based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), where second-sound dissipation is determined primarily by the resistive anharmonic phonon scattering rate. Calculations using the linearized BTE are also presented, along with analysis of second sound based on the BTE. This approach results in significantly longer lifetimes for second sound in comparison to our MD simulation results. Predictions for the response due to time-dependent sources are also presented, including insight into how time-dependent sources could be tuned to result in weak or strong temperature oscillations, and how time-dependent experiments might probe the spectra associated with second sound. Results are discussed in the context of second sound in graphite in the temperature range from 100-200K.

Abstract: Spin spirals represent a fundamental class of noncollinear yet coplanar magnetic structures that give rise to diverse emergent phenomena reflecting spin chirality. We investigate metallic systems hosting commensurate spin spirals and uncover an unconventional anomalous Hall effect (AHE) induced by spiral magnetism. The spin spiral introduces odd-parity spin splitting with polarization perpendicular to the helical plane, forming spin-nodal lines in the electronic structure. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, we find that these nodal lines become gapped by finite magnetization, concentrating the Berry curvature near the gap and generating a distinctive AHE. We identify the interplay among the spin-orbit coupling, helical plane orientation, and magnetization direction as the key ingredient for this spiral-induced AHE, which is expected to occur across a wide range of materials hosting commensurate spin spirals.

Abstract: Diffusive approximations of Markov jump processes often fail to accurately capture large fluctuations. This is confounding, as the rare events triggered by these large fluctuations, such as the failure of electronic memories, are often the object of interest. In this paper we present an improved diffusive approximation, extending a method previously limited to equilibrium systems. Using new tools from stochastic thermodynamics, we prove its validity to linear order in departures from equilibrium and demonstrate its superior accuracy over the Kramers-Moyal expansion in predicting both steady-state and transient properties, including the error rate of a non-equilibrium electronic memory.

TL;DR: Indentifying electron spin density correlations in 2D van der Waals materials using excitons in moiré lattices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of 2D materials has become increasingly important due to their tunable nature and applications in emerging technologies. While conventional probing methods are inefficient for such materials, this research opens a new avenue for effective characterization of spin correlations using excitons in moiré lattices.

Method: The research employs second-order perturbation theory and analysis of electron-exciton scattering to demonstrate that excitons can detect spin density correlations in the material. The method involves electron tunneling to a moiré lattice, scattering off excitons, and returning, leading to measurable energy shifts in the exciton spectrum.

Result: The results show that the energy shifts in the exciton spectrum are directly proportional to the spin density-density correlations of electrons, allowing for the detection of quantum phase transitions and superconducting pairing symmetries in 2D materials.

Conclusion: This work introduces a promising optical probe for studying electron spin density correlations, significantly advancing the understanding of quantum phases in new 2D materials and enabling innovation in material science and quantum technologies.

Abstract: The rapidly growing class of atomically thin and tunable van der Waals materials is intensely investigated both in the context of fundamental science and for new technologies. There is in this connection a widespread need for new ways to probe the electronic properties of these layered materials, since their two-dimensional (2D) character make conventional probes less efficient. Here, we show how excitons trapped in a moiré lattice can be used as an optical probe for spatially resolved electron spin density correlations in such materials. The electrons in the material of interest virtually tunnel to the moiré lattice where they scatter on the excitons after which they tunnel back. This gives rise to an effective spin-dependent and spatially localised potential felt by the electrons, which in turn leads to energy shifts that can be measured spectroscopically in the exciton spectrum. Using second order perturbation theory combined with a solution to the exciton-electron scattering problem, we show that the electrons mediate an interaction between two excitons resulting in an energy shift proportional to their two-point spin density-density correlation function evaluated at the exciton positions. We then discuss two specific applications of our setup. First, we show that quantum phase transitions between different in-plane anti-ferromagnetic orders in a 2D lattice give rise to large and measurable shifts in the exciton spectrum in the critical regions. Second, we analyse how different pairing symmetries of superconducting phases can be probed. This demonstrates that our scheme opens up new ways to probe electron spin density correlations, which is a key property of many quantum phases predicted to exist in the new 2D materials.

Abstract: We analyze theoretically THz response of an electron-hole pair confined in a semiconductor nanoparticle. We show that the interplay of particle confinement and electron-hole Coulomb interaction leads to significant renormalizations and energy shifts in THz linear conductivity of the nanocrystal. We develop and evaluate models in the strong and the weak confinement regime in order to correctly address the effect of Coulomb interaction. In the weak confinement regime, we find solutions of the problem in a form similar to the Wannier wavefunction whose spatial extent is reduced as a consequence of the confinement. The resulting states are scalable down to the strong confinement regime, enabling a theoretical description of the exciton response for arbitrarily sized nanoparticles.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The study demonstrates a method to enable acoustic spin rotation in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) by combining optical coupling to trion states with acoustic modulation. This approach circumvents the inefficiency of phonon coupling to single electron spins, potentially advancing on-chip quantum hybrid systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses a key limitation in semiconductor quantum dots, where phonons weakly couple to single electron spins, hindering their use in integrated quantum systems. This motivates the development of an alternative method for spin manipulation that doesn't rely on phonon coupling.

Method: The proposed method combines continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state with acoustic modulation. This approach allows for spin rotation by introducing an axis defined by the acoustic field, enabling transitions between spin states that are disrupted by the optical coupling.

Result: Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be extremely high, specifically 99.9%, if the trion lifetime is sufficiently long (50 ns) and Zeeman splitting is large enough (44 GHz). This suggests a promising pathway for high-fidelity spin state transfer in on-chip quantum systems.

Conclusion: The method described in the paper offers a viable solution to a significant challenge in quantum spin manipulation, potentially enabling new applications in quantum computing and sensing by integrating acoustic, optical, and microwave domains in a single chip setup.

Abstract: Mechanical degrees of freedom very weakly couple to spins in semiconductors. The inefficient coupling between phonons and single electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) hinders their integration into on-chip acoustically coupled quantum hybrid systems. We propose a hybrid acousto-optical spin control method that circumvents this problem and effectively introduces acoustic spin rotation to QDs, complementing their rich couplings with external fields and quantum registers. We show that combining continuous-wave detuned optical coupling to a trion state and acoustic modulation results in spin rotation around an axis defined by the acoustic field. The optical field breaks spin conservation, allowing phonons to drive transitions between disrupted spin states when at resonance with the Zeeman frequency. Our method is compatible with pulse sequences that mitigate quasi-static noise effects, which makes trion recombination the primary limitation to gate fidelity under cooled nuclear-spin conditions. Numerical simulations indicate that spin rotation fidelity can be very high, if the trion lifetime is long and Zeeman splitting is sufficiently large, with a currently feasible 50~ns lifetime and 44~GHz splitting giving 99.9\% fidelity. Applying our advancement could enable acoustic QD spin state transfer to diverse solid-state systems and transduction between acoustic, optical, and microwave domains, all within an on-chip integration-ready setting.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superconducting thermoelectric bolometers have been identified as promising for cosmological experiments, particularly for large arrays, due to their passive nature and good heat budget. This paper aimed to advance such devices with a new design and optimize its performance.

Method: The authors designed a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction detector. They characterize the device using numerical simulations of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating on both sides. They derived new noise expressions because the temperatures of both sides differ from the bath temperature. The simulations provide NEP, response time, and SNR integration time for specific input powers.

Result: The device shows NEP ≈ 4×10⁻¹⁷ W/√Hz, a response time of ≈200 ns, and an SNR=1 integration time of ≈100 μs. The design proves concept for large-scale cosmological experiments with its passive operation and efficient heat management.

Conclusion: The designed superconducting thermoelectric bolometer successfully demonstrates the potential for use in cosmological experiments, particularly in large-scale setups, by integrating the advantages of passive operation, efficient heat management, and optimized sensitivity.

Abstract: We design a superconducting thermoelectric bolometer made of a Graphene-Insulator-Superconductor tunnel junction. Our detector has the advantage of being passive, as it directly transduces input power to a voltage without the need to modulate an external bias. We characterize the device via numerical simulation of the full nonlinear thermal dynamical model of the junction, considering heating of both sides of the junction. While estimating noise contributions, we found novel expressions due to the temperatures of both sides being different than the bath temperature. Numerical simulations show a Noise Equivalent Power ${\rm NEP}\sim 4\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm W}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for an input power of $\sim10^{-16}\,{\rm W}$, a response time of $τ_{th}\sim 200\, {\rm ns}$ and an integration time to obtain a Signal-to-Noise Ratio ${\rm SNR}=1$ of $τ_{\rm SNR=1}\sim 100\,μ{\rm s}$ for an input power $\sim 10^{-13}\,{\rm W}$. Therefore, the device shows promise for large-array cosmological experiment applications, also considering its advantages for fabrication and heat budget.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin-resolved thermoelectric transport in a triangular ladder geometry hosting antiferromagnetic spin alignment, where lattice topology and magnetic ordering jointly enable highly efficient spin-selective energy conversion. The inherent geometric frustration of the ladder, together with intrinsic spin-filtering mechanisms, is shown to promote a pronounced separation between spin channels. Implementing spin-dependent onsite modulations, such as binary asymmetric potentials, induces pronounced spin splitting in the transmission spectrum, enabling controlled spin-selective transport and highlighting the role of lattice engineering in tailoring spin-dependent thermoelectric response. Additional control is achieved through modulation of the hopping amplitudes, which activates multiple transport pathways and allows fine tuning of spin-dependent conduction. A detailed evaluation of charge and spin thermoelectric coefficients reveals a strong enhancement of the thermoelectric performance, with the dimensionless figure of merit ZT reaching large values in optimized parameter regimes. Notably, the spin figure of merit systematically surpasses its charge counterpart, underscoring the decisive role of lattice geometry and antiferromagnetic order in amplifying spin thermoelectric efficiency. Our findings provide a versatile theoretical platform for designing low-dimensional spin-caloritronic devices with enhanced functionality.

Abstract: Strain engineering enables quantum confinement in pristine graphene without degrading its intrinsic mobility and spin coherence. Here, we extend previously proposed strain-induced charge-qubit architectures by incorporating spin degrees of freedom through Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and Zeeman fields, enabling spin-qubit operation in single-layer graphene (SLG). In a graphene p-n junction, a strain-induced nanobubble generates a pseudo-magnetic field that forms double quantum dots with gate-tunable level hybridization. Tight-binding quantum transport simulations and a four-band model reveal two distinct avoided crossings: spin-conserving gaps at zero detuning and spin-flip gaps at finite detuning, the latter increasing with SOC strength while the former decreases. Time-domain simulations confirm detuning-dependent Rabi oscillations corresponding to these two operational regimes. These results demonstrate that strain-induced confinement combined with tunable SOC provides a viable mechanism for coherent spin manipulation in pristine graphene, positioning strained SLG as a promising platform for scalable spin-based quantum technologies.

Conclusion: The prediction of these magnonic effects highlights the potential for novel applications in spintronic memory devices, offering innovative approaches towards more efficient magnetic memory technologies.

Abstract: We develop a theory of thermomagnonic torques in insulating altermagnets and predict a spin-splitter magnonic torque arising from the spin Seebeck effect. Additionally, we predict an anisotropic entropic torque. We study the effects of these torques on magnetic-texture dynamics and identify various anisotropic responses to temperature gradients. In particular, we predict spin-current-induced domain-wall precession, which can slow domain-wall motion for certain temperature-gradient directions. We also predict a temperature-gradient-driven anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect that enables fast skyrmion motion in response to thermal gradients. Our findings will be useful for spintronic applications such as magnetic racetrack memories and will serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in insulating altermagnets with magnetic textures.

Abstract: We present a quantum information-inspired framework for analyzing complex systems through multivariate time series. In this approach the system's state is encoded into a density matrix, providing a compact representation of higher-order correlations and dependencies. This formulation enables precise quantification of the relative influence among time series, tracking of their response to external perturbations and also the definition of a recovery timescale without need for dimensional reduction. By leveraging tools such as fidelity from quantum information theory, our method naturally captures higher-order co-fluctuations beyond pairwise statistics, offering a holistic characterization of resilience and similarity in high-dimensional dynamics. We validate this approach on synthetic data generated by a 9-dimensional modified Lorenz-96 model and demonstrate its utility on real-world climate data, analyzing global temperature anomalies across nine regions, quantifying the dissimilarity of each 288-month time window up to July 2025 relative to the 1850-1874 baseline period.

Abstract: The usual theoretical model for synchrotron radiation in circular accelerators (synchrotrons and storage rings) is to treat a single electron moving in a horizontal circle in a uniform vertical magnetic field, but the true situation in real storage rings is more complicated and exhibits much richer physics. The magnetic fields are inhomogeneous, and there is a bunch of many particles and they traverse a distribution of orbits (hence they encounter different magnetic fields). This results in so-called ``depolarizing spin resonances'' (which do not appear in a simple model of a uniform vertical magnetic field). The calculation of the equilibrium electron spin polarization requires a much more careful analysis. For example, a key insight is that, for motion in inhomogeneous magnetic fields, ``spin flip'' is in general \emph{not} a $180^\circ$ reversal of the spin orientation. The physics of radiative spin polarization involves a mix of many disciplines, and provides a good example of cross-disciplinary thinking. We shall also briefly note the connection to astrophysics. The astrophysics literature mainly treats electron motion in very strong magnetic fields, stronger than the Schwinger critical field (for example a neutron star). It is a problem of ongoing interest in astrophysics to study the radiation by electrons circulating in such strong magnetic fields. This article aims to provide the reader with a survey of the basic physics principles of radiative spin polarization, omitting low-level mathematical algebra as much as possible. Such details can be found in the literature, and are not relevant here.

Motivation: The motivation is to simplify calculations for radiative transport in semi-infinite media by leveraging 1D analyses and polynomial representations.

Method: The method involves projecting a 3D photon walk onto an axial direction, creating a 1D alternating process. This process uses first-return and first-passage events, modeled with Motzkin-type polynomials and high-order integrals. The paper introduces a truncation factor with a Cauchy distribution to handle boundary constraints, derived from Monte Carlo simulations.

Result: The approach yields first-return probabilities accurate within 2% for g ≤ 0.7, matching full 3D Monte Carlo simulations. It provides an efficient alternative for radiative transport problems.

Conclusion: The method simplifies 3D scattering calculations using 1D alternating processes and Motzkin-type polynomials, offering accurate and efficient solutions for radiative transport in semi-infinite media.

Abstract: A photon entering a scattering medium executes a three-dimensional random walk determined by the Henyey-Greenstein phase function. The photon either reaches the boundary for a first passage or is absorbed. Projecting the walk onto the axial direction produces a one-dimensional alternating process whose peaks and valleys correspond to changes in the sign of the projected step. This reduction preserves first-return and first-passage events and leads to a representation in terms of Motzkin-type polynomials. The analytical formulation is complete except for boundary-constrained return terms, which appear as high-order integrals. We treat these contributions with a single truncation factor determined from Monte Carlo simulations of first-return distributions over a wide range of anisotropy g and scattering steps ms. The resulting factor follows a Cauchy distribution. Incorporating it yields first-return probabilities in agreement with full three-dimensional Monte Carlo to within 2% for g<=0.7. The approach gives backscattering coefficients from phase-function integrals and provides an efficient alternative to full three-dimensional simulations for problems of radiative transport in semi-infinite media.

Abstract: Microcavity optical frequency combs (microcombs) are compact, coherent light sources whose chip-scale integrability is poised to drive advances in metrology, communications, and sensing. Among available microcomb generation methods, hybrid cavities uniquely co-locate gain and Kerr dynamics, where the lasing mode directly resonates in the nonlinear microcavity, simultaneously enabling self-sustained and highly efficient microcomb generation. However, their implementation is often limited by partial integration or the need for external injection, which complicates operation architecture, raises power and hampers system miniaturization. In this work, we present a fully integrated hybrid cavity for self-sustained microcomb generation, relying solely on the co-oscillation of lasing and Kerr nonlinearity without external driving. The system collapses the pump laser, nonlinear resonator and feedback loops into a minimalist on-chip two-element cavity, consisting of a high-Q microresonator with engineered intracavity reflection and a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). The scheme delivers self-starting operation and stable performance without active feedback. The generated coherent microcomb achieves intrinsic linewidths below 1 kHz and integrated linewidths around 100 kHz, with self-sustained operation exceeding 24 hours. This ultra-compact architecture provides a practical path toward scalable, coherent multi-wavelength sources for integrated photonic systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and enhancing the nonlinear optical response of ultrathin plasmonic films, particularly those approaching the TD thickness limit and exhibiting ENZ behavior, is crucial for advancing applications in light_matter interaction, wave control, and nonlinear optical devices.

Method: Systematic Z_scan measurements were conducted on TiN films with varying thicknesses. The nonlinear absorption was analyzed across the ENZ spectral region and incidence angles, employing a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model to interpret the data.

Result: The investigation revealed that decreasing the thickness of TiN films leads to a significant increase in nonlinear absorption, especially within the ENZ region. This enhancement is attributed to unique electron confinement effects in TD plasmonic systems.

Conclusion: The findings confirm the potential of highly thin TiN plasmonic films as a robust platform for harnessing nonlinear optical phenomena enabled by ENZ effects in ultrathin photonic systems.

Abstract: Ultrathin plasmonic films that approach the trans-dimensional (TD) thickness limit provide a promising route for light_matter interaction control and manipulation, yet their nonlinear optical response near the epsilon_near_zero (ENZ) condition remains poorly understood. Here, we report the strongly enhanced optical nonlinearity for their typical representative high quality TiN epitaxial films with thicknesses down to a few nanometers. Systematic Z_scan measurements reveal a pronounced increase in nonlinear absorption with decreasing thickness. Especially in the ENZ spectral region, the TD TiN films exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude stronger nonlinear absorption over a broad range of incidence angles as compared to conventional thin films. The enhanced nonlinear absorption observed is well described by a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model that accounts for electron confinement effects unique to the TD plasmonic systems. Comparison with Ti1_xAlxN highlights the necessity of low-loss ENZ response for nonlinear enhancement. These findings identify TiN and similar TD plasmonic systems as a robust refractory platform for exploiting ENZ mediated nonlinear processes in ultrathin photonic material structures.

Abstract: The photonic Spin Hall Effect (SHE) causes a polarization-dependent transverse shift of light at an interface. There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $Λ$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $φ$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $Ω_μ$. At zero probe field detuning ($Δ_p = 0$) and $φ=0,π$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $Ω_μ$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $Ω_μ$. At intermediate phases, especially at $φ= π/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $Ω_μ$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $φ$ at an optimized value of $Ω_μ$ and $Ω_{c}$. In contrast, at $Δ_p = \pm Ω_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $φ\leq π$ and $Ω_μ \geq Ω_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index. Our results may have potential applications in microwave quantum sensing and quantum optical switches based on the photonic SHE.

Abstract: High-quality Kerr resonators are a key platform for studying nonlinear optical phenomena, where bifurcations such as optical bistability and spontaneous symmetry breaking are both of theoretical and practical significance. In this work, we present an analytical framework, which allows finding the stationary states and their bifurcations for the propagating fields in Kerr ring and Fabry-Perot resonators. Using tools from nonlinear algebra, namely, polynomial resultants and Groebner bases, we derive compact polynomial expressions describing the system full solution in both intensity and amplitude representations. The bifurcations are derived from these expressions, and are additionally characterized as exceptional points of an auxiliary linear non-Hermitian system. This work unifies key phenomena in Kerr resonators under the broader framework of nonlinear algebra and offers better control of nonlinear optical systems and the design of photonic devices, enabled by full analytic control.

Abstract: Structured light beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), such as Laguerre-Gaussian modes, are promising tools for high-capacity optical communications and advanced biomedical imaging. However, multiple scattering in turbid media distorts their phase and amplitude, complicating the retrieval of topological charge. We introduce VortexNet, a deep learning architecture that integrates an Angular Fourier Transform to explicitly extract rotational symmetries of OAM beams from experimentally acquired intensity and interference patterns. By transforming spatial information into the angular frequency domain, VortexNet isolates azimuthal features that persist despite scattering, enabling accurate topological charge classification even in complex optical environments. The results reveal that OAM-specific angular correlations can survive multiple scattering and be decoded through angular-domain learning. This establishes a new paradigm for structured-light analysis in complex medium, where deep learning enables the recovery of topological information beyond the reach of classical optics, paving the way for resilient photonic systems in communication, sensing, and imaging.

Abstract: It is well established that light can control magnetism in matter, e.g. via the inverse Faraday effect or ultrafast demagnetization. However, such control is typically limited to magnetization transverse to light's polarization plane, or out-of-plane magnetism in 2D materials, while in-plane magnetic moments have remained largely unexplored. This is due to the difficulty of generating electronic orbital angular momentum components within light's polarization plane. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating complete three-dimensional, all-optical control of magnetism in 2D materials. Using first-principles simulations, we show that a tailored, two-color laser field can induce and steer magnetic moments in any direction with the relative angle between the laser polarizations playing a key parameter in coherent control. We analyze the physical mechanism of this process and show that it arises from a simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in the two-color laser. In-plane orbital moments are introduced via non-zero out-of-plane longitudinal photogalvanic currents enabled by broken inversion and mirror symmetries, while time-reversal symmetry breaking enables build-up of spin-rotation processes through spin-orbit coupling, translating the orbital moments to transient magnetism. Our findings demonstrate a full 3D coherent control scheme for transient magnetic states on femtosecond timescales driven by tailored lasers, and can be used to develop novel spectroscopies for magnetism, all-optical magnetic switching for ultrafast spintronics, and novel information storage capabilities.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) constitute a foundational resource for quantum technologies, including secure communication, photonic quantum computing, and emerging quantum network architectures. A wide range of quantum materials, from atom-like point defects in bulk crystals to excitonic states in low-dimensional semiconductors, now provide bright, coherent, and scalable sources of non-classical light. Meanwhile, advances in photonic integration have enabled efficient routing, filtering, and on-chip manipulation of these emitters. From this perspective, we survey and discuss the technological landscape in which solid-state emitters interface with quantum sensing, quantum communication, quantum computation, and emerging photonic AI platforms. Further, we discuss the materials landscape underpinning modern single-photon sources from the zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, two-dimensional and three-dimensional materials. Lastly, we highlight key integration pathways for these single-photon emitters into scalable quantum photonic systems.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper reports on the noise characterization of a free-running ring quantum cascade laser emitting a single frequency mode around 7.7 µm. They used a N2O gas cell as a frequency-to-voltage discriminator to measure frequency noise power spectral density and extracted the linewidth. The results show a FWHM of 50 kHz at 1 s integration time, which is at least a sixfold improvement compared to state-of-the-art quantum cascade lasers above 7 µm. Additionally, they demonstrated that these lasers can be used for frequency modulation spectroscopy, opening new possibilities for high resolution metrology and spectroscopic applications in the mid-infrared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum cascade lasers are popular for their high efficiency and tunability in the mid-infrared. However, significant noise and narrow linewidth limit their performance in metrology and spectroscopy applications. This paper aims to characterize and improve the noise properties of such lasers for enhanced metrology and spectroscopic applications.

Method: The researchers used a free-running ring quantum cascade laser emitting at 7.7 µm. They employed a nitrogen-based gas cell (N2O) as a frequency-to-voltage discriminator to convert the laser frequency into a voltage signal, which was then analyzed to measure frequency noise power spectral density. The linewidth was extracted from these measurements.

Result: The frequency noise power spectral density measurement showed a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 50 kHz at an integration time of 1 second. This represents a significant improvement— at least a sixfold reduction—compared to state-of-the-art quantum cascade lasers operating in wavelengths above 7 µm. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that these lasers can effectively be utilized in frequency modulation spectroscopy, suggesting potential advancements in high-resolution metrology and spectroscopic techniques in the mid-infrared region.

Conclusion: This study provides critical insights into the noise characteristics of quantum cascade lasers, which are essential for optimizing their performance in metrology and spectroscopy. The observed improvement in linewidth and the successful implementation of frequency modulation spectroscopy highlight the potential for these lasers in high-precision applications in the mid-infrared spectrum.

Abstract: We report on the noise characterization of a free-running ring quantum cascade laser resonator emitting a single frequency mode around 7.7 $μ$m. Using a gas cell filled with N$_2$O as a frequency-to-voltage discriminator, we measured the frequency noise power spectral density of the laser from which we extracted its linewidth. The results show a full width at half maximum close to 50 kHz at 1 s integration time, which represents at least a sixfold improvement compared to state-of-the-art quantum cascade lasers operating in a spectral region above 7 $μ$m. We also demonstrate that such lasers can be efficiently used for frequency modulation spectroscopy, which opens up new possibilities for high resolution metrology and spectroscopic applications in the mid-infrared.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Metasurfaces are a powerful tool for manipulating light using small structures on the nanoscale. In most meta-surfaces, near-field couplings are treated as unfavorable perturbations. Here, we experimentally investigate a structure consisting of sinusoidally modulated silicon waveguides where near-field coupling of local resonances leads to negative coupling, i.e. a negative coupling constant. This gives rise to wave-vector dependent eigenstates of elliptical, linear and circular polarizations. In particular, fully circular polarization states are not only present at a single point in momentum-space (k-space), but along a line. This circular polarization line, as well as a linear polarization line, emanates from a polarization degeneracy at the Dirac point. We experimentally validate the existence of these eigenstates and demonstrate the energy-, polarization- and wave-vector-dependence of this metasurface. By tuning the incident k-vector, certain polarization-energy eigenstates are strongly reflected allowing for uses in angle-tunable polarization filters and light sources.

Abstract: Plasmonic metasurfaces have emerged as a promising platform for enhancing a range of nonlinear optical processes, offering compact geometry and flexibility in light manipulation. Second order nonlinear processes, like second harmonic generation (SHG), typically require non-centrosymmetric crystals to be realized. Here, we experimentally demonstrate enhanced SHG response by using a gold nanocavity array forming a plasmonic metasurface absorber where titanium dioxide (TiO2), a centrosymmetric dielectric material, with subwavelength thickness is deposited in the realized nanogaps. While such dielectric material has an extremely low second order nonlinear susceptibility, we observe 105-fold boosting in the nonlinear SHG process mainly due to the surface nonlinear susceptibility of the gold metal aided by the significant electric field enhancement that occurs in the nanogaps due to the formed nanocavity resonance. The experimental results obtained are theoretically explained with extensive and rigorous nonlinear simulations that consider all the bulk and surface linear and nonlinear material properties. The presented robust harmonic generation from an ultrathin plasmonic metasurface can be used in nonlinear and quantum integrated photonic applications.

Result: 三个Backlink均表现出亚皮米特(non-reciprocity)水平，噪声地板低于1 pm√Hz。

Conclusion: 当前Backlink技术满足LISA的需求，需进一步优化以应对未来任务。

Abstract: The current planned space-based gravitational-wave detectors require a bidirectional optical connection, referred to as Backlink, between two adjacent optical benches to provide a mutual phase reference for the local interferometric measurements. However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\text{ pm}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise. This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA.

Abstract: Designed to detect gravitational waves in the lower-frequency band, the space mission LISA will open a new window to astronomy after its launch in the 2030s. Each LISA spacecraft houses two optical benches that require the exchange of a phase reference between them via an optical connection, called a Backlink. Here we present the construction and commissioning of an ultra-stable quasi-monolithic optical testbed to investigate different Backlink implementations: a direct fiber, a frequency-separated fiber, and a free-beam link, compared in the Three-Backlink Experiment. Dedicated alignment techniques crucial for the construction of these optical benches are presented together with the development of a high-precision beam alignment and measurement tool - a Calibrated Quadrant Photodiode Singleton. An upper limit for the performance of all three investigated Backlink schemes, as determined by initial experiments, can be set at a $15\text{pm}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$-equivalent level within the LISA band, spanning 0.1mHz to 1Hz. Our measurements were able to verify the successful construction and commissioning of this very complex interferometer as an interferometric laboratory testbed for LISA. We find no limitations due to the construction on the here reported performance levels. Our results can support the construction of high-precision metrology testbeds for space-based laser interferometry for future gravitational wave or geodesy missions.

Abstract: We show that using strongly coupled dual-core waveguides for supercontinuum generation shifts the wavelength of the high-frequency dispersive waves towards shorter wavelengths, as compared to generation in a single-core waveguide having the same core dimensions. In a demonstration experiment, we launch ultrashort infrared pump pulses at 1-$μ$m wavelength (285-THz frequency) into silicon nitride waveguides, where soliton formation and fission leads to generation of dispersive waves in the visible range. Efficient input coupling and controlled excitation of the fundamental supermodes of the dual-core waveguide is provided with adiabatic tapers and a dual-prong input structure. For the dual-core waveguide, the short-wavelength dispersive wave is located at 540~nm (green, 555~THz), which is blue-shifted by 80~nm (70~THz) compared to that of the single-core waveguide. Simultaneously, the dual-core waveguide generates broadband radiation spanning from the blue into the UV range, reaching to below 350~nm (above 855~THz), with typically a spectral density 25~dB below that of the dispersive wave. The broadband component can be addressed to third harmonic generation and is not observed in single-core supercontinuum generation. Numerical modeling shows good agreement with experimental measurements. The demonstrated dual-core approach and dedicated input coupling appear to hold promise also for other waveguide structures, independent of specific materials or core dimensions, by providing shorter wavelengths than with the respective single-core waveguide.

Abstract: Topological photonic systems support edge states that are robust against disorder and perturbation. Depending on the symmetry and dimensionality of the bulk systems, different edge states emulating soliton, quantum integer and quantum spin Hall effects have been realized. A major concern in photonics is how one can shape the strength and polarisation of electromagnetic fields to suit different applications. Here, we show zero-dimensional (0D) interface state arising from one-dimensional (1D) dissipative topological photonic crystals exhibit strong field localisation and spin-momentum locking thanks to its complex classical analogue Dirac mass parameter. By using spatiotemporal coupled mode theory to formulate 1D photonic crystals and their corresponding Jackiw Rebbi-like (JR) interface state, we find the interaction between two energy bands at high symmetry points plays a major role in defining not only the topological triviality of the crystals but also its complex Dirac mass parameter. More importantly, when two topological trivial and nontrivial bulk systems are brought together to form a JR state, while the real part of the Dirac mass parameter governs the spectral and spatial field localisations of the interface state, the imaginary part gives rise to a net flow of energy towards the interface and a transverse spin angular momentum, resulting in a strong spin-momentum locking. We verify our theory by 1D plasmonic crystals using finite-difference time-domain simulations as well as far-field angle-resolved spectroscopy and imaging.

Abstract: Dynamical control of quantum matter is a challenging, yet promising direction for probing strongly correlated states. Motivated by recent experiments in twisted MoTe$_2$ that demonstrated optical control of magnetization, we propose a protocol for probing magnetization dynamics in flat-band ferromagnets. We investigate the nucleation and dynamical growth of magnetic bubbles prepared on top of a false vaccum in both itinerant ferromagnets and spin-polarized Chern insulators. For ferromagnetic metals, we emphasize the crucial role of a non-trivial quantum geometry in the magnetization dynamics, which in turn also provides a probe for the quantum metric. Furthermore, for quantum Hall ferromagnets, we show how properties of chiral edge modes localized at domain-wall boundaries can be dynamically accessed. Our work demonstrates the potential for nonequilibrium protocols to control and probe strongly correlated phases, with particular relevance for twisted MoTe$_2$ and graphene-based flat-band ferromagnets.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ necessitates a minimal theoretical model that unifies the superconducting phase with the spin-density-wave (SDW) phase without external pressure or strain. We propose a model where half-filled $d_{z^{2}}$ local moments interact with itinerant $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ electrons via strong Hund's coupling $J_H$, which reduces to a bilayer type-II t-J model in the large $J_H$ limit. Using iDMRG calculations on an $L_y=4, L_z=2$ cylinder, we demonstrate that the competition between double-exchange ferromagnetism and in-plane superexchange generates period-4 stripe-like SDW order-a feature absent in one-orbital t-J model with only $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. Furthermore, increasing the interlayer exchange coupling suppresses magnetic order and stabilizes interlayer s-wave superconductivity. These results identify the type-II t-J model as a minimal framework for capturing the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in bilayer nickelates.

Abstract: We study the one-dimensional S=1 XXZ spin model with single-ion anisotropy. It is known that at the transition points between the Haldane and large-D phases, the model exhibits a quantum criticality described by the Gaussian theory, i.e., a conformal field theory with the central charge c=1. Using the bosonization approach, we investigate various correlation functions at the phase transition and derive their asymptotic forms. This allows us to clarify their peculiar behavior: the longitudinal (transverse) two-point spin correlation function has components that decay algebraically only in the uniform (staggered) sector. These theoretical predictions are verified by the numerical calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group method. The effect of weak bond alternation on the critical ground state at the phase transition is also discussed. It is shown that the bond alternation induces the missing power-law components in the correlation functions.

Abstract: We propose a method to determine the quantum phase boundaries of one-dimensional systems using sine-square deformation (SSD). Based on the proposition, supported by several exactly solved cases though not proven in full generality, that ``if a one-dimensional system is gapless, then the expectation value of any local observable in the ground state of the Hamiltonian with SSD exhibits translational symmetry in the thermodynamic limit," we determine the quantum critical point as the location where a local observable becomes site-independent, identified through finite-size scaling analysis. As case studies, we consider two models: the antiferromagnetic Ising chain in mixed transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions. We calculate the ground state of these Hamiltonians with SSD using the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm and evaluate the local transverse magnetization. For the nearest-neighbor model, we show that the quantum critical point can be accurately estimated by our procedure with systems of up to 84 sites, or even smaller, in good agreement with results from the literature. For the long-range model, we find that the phase boundary between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases is slightly shifted relative to the nearest-neighbor case, leading to a reduced region of antiferromagnetic order. Moreover, we propose an experimental procedure to implement the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising couplings with SSD using Rydberg atom arrays in optical tweezers, which can be achieved within a very good approximation. Because multiple independent scaling conditions naturally emerge, our approach enables precise determination of quantum critical points and possibly even the extraction of additional critical phenomena, such as critical exponents, from relatively small system sizes.

Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ruby lattice with uniform first- and second-neighbor interactions, which forms a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing tetrahedra. Using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), we study the ground state of the system to find that it assumes a gapped threefold-degenerate simplex crystal ground state, with strong singlets formed on pairs of neighboring triangles. We argue that the formation of the simplex singlet ground state at the isotropic point relates to the weak inter-triangle coupling limit where an effective spin-chirality Hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice exhibits an extensively degenerate ground state manifold of singlet coverings at the mean-field level. Under an applied Zeeman field, the iPEPS simulations uncover magnetization plateaus at $m/m_s = 0, 1/3, 1/2,$ and $2/3$, separated by intermediate supersolid phases, all breaking the sixfold rotational symmetry of the lattice. Unlike the checkerboard lattice, these plateaus cannot be described by strongly localized magnons.

Abstract: Soft phonon modes in tetragonal CeCoSi, which undergoes a structural transition at $T_0=12$ K followed by antiferromagnetic order at $T_{\text{N}}=9.5$ K, have been investigated using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. Pronounced softening was detected in the transverse acoustic modes corresponding to the $(yz+zx)$-type monoclinic distortion, consistent with the experimentally determined triclinic structure. Remarkably, the softening persists up to the zone boundary along (0, 0, $q$), indicating a short correlation length of the lattice instability. This instability, characterized by a Curie-type strain susceptibility, is interpreted as a consequence of the on-site $4f$-$5d$ hybridization, which is intrinsic to this crystal structure due to the lack of inversion symmetry at the two Ce sites.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对镧基氧化物在高压和高温下电子相变的深入理解，解释了材料从非金属向金属转变的过程及其背后的物理机制。

Abstract: Analysis of the thermal and baric evolution of resistance in $LaBa_2Fe_3O_{8+δ}$ enabled the construction of its pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagram, which prominently displays a critical boundary, $P^{MIT}_c(T)$, marking the transition from localized to hole-type extended states. The relatively low critical pressures [$P^{MIT}_c(T) \approx 3$-8 GPa] suggest that, as $P \rightarrow P_c$ in this narrow-gap, strongly correlated charge-transfer system, both the hybridization strength and the charge-transfer character are progressively enhanced - ultimately leading to the emergence of metallicity. Emphasizing the electronic nature of this transition, pressure-dependent structural analyses at room temperature reveal no associated structural phase transition at $P^{MIT}_c(T)$; the system retains a (weakly tetragonally distorted) quasicubic perovskite structure with Murnaghan-type compressibility up to 30\,GPa. The emergence of hole delocalization and metallic conduction, coupled with suppressed antiferromagnetism, suggests proximity to quantum criticality.

Abstract: We analyze the impact of the lattice geometry on the thermodynamic transition to magnetically ordered phases in strongly interacting electron systems for various Bravais lattices in three and four dimensions, including both local and nonlocal correlation effects. In a first step we use the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which takes into account purely local correlations, to calculate the magnetic susceptibilities of the Hubbard model on three (3d-sc) and four dimensional (4d-sc) simple cubic/hypercubic, as well as on three dimensional body- (bcc) and face-centered (fcc) cubic lattices, and determine the transition temperature to the corresponding magnetically-ordered state. In a second step, we exploit the dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A), a diagrammatic extension of DMFT, to include the effect of nonlocal correlations which are particularly important in the vicinity of the corresponding phase transition. For the bipartite 3d-sc, 4d-sc and bcc lattices nonlocal fluctuations lead to a substantial reduction of the DMFT transition temperature consistent to the overall tendency of mean-field approaches to overestimate the stability of ordered phases. As expected, the magnitude of the difference between the DMFT, being exact in the limit of large connectivity/dimensions, and D$Γ$A transition temperatures decreases with increasing coordination number. On a more practical perspective, these results also provide a reasonable guidance to evaluate the expected overestimation of the DMFT ordering temperature for different material geometries. For the fcc lattice, on the other hand, the ordered phase observed in DMFT vanishes completely within D$Γ$A which is consistent with the existence of strong geometric frustration in this lattice.

*Hongyu Chen,Yangfeng Fu,Weiqiang Yu,Rong Yu,Z. Y. Xie*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper proposes a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in 2D quantum lattice models, combining the nested tensor network method with automatic differentiation to significantly reduce computational cost. The framework is shown to handle bond dimensions up to 9, achieving accurate ground-state energies and order parameters in quantum spin models, including an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid in the Shastry-Sutherland model. The approach demonstrates potential for large-scale tensor network calculations in 2D quantum systems. The results offer a promising computational method without requiring GPU acceleration or symmetry implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid advancement in quantum computing and condensed matter physics necessitates efficient numerical methods to study complex quantum systems, especially two-dimensional lattice models where exact solutions are intractable. Novel computational frameworks are crucial to tackle these challenges and enable accurate predictions of ground-state properties and phase transitions in such systems.

Method: The method presented in the paper is a single-layer tensor network framework that integrates the nested tensor network method with automatic differentiation. This combination allows for a reduction in computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, making it possible to perform highly efficient variational calculations. The key innovation lies in leveraging automatic differentiation to optimize the tensor network efficiently.

Result: The framework successfully demonstrates its capability through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. By achieving bond dimensions up to 9 without GPU acceleration or symmetry implementation, the method provides accurate ground-state energy calculations and consistent order parameters. Notably, the framework confirms the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model, with discussions on algorithm convergence and potential for further improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed single-layer tensor network framework represents a significant advancement in the efficient calculation of ground states for two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method with automatic differentiation, the framework enables highly efficient computations even at non-negligible bond dimensions, paving the way for further studies of complex quantum systems without the need for high-performance computing resources.

Abstract: We propose a single-layer tensor network framework for the variational determination of ground states in two-dimensional quantum lattice models. By combining the nested tensor network method [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045128 (2017)] with the automatic differentiation technique, our approach can reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude in bond dimension, and therefore enables highly efficient variational ground-state calculations. We demonstrate the capability of this framework through two quantum spin models: the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice and the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model. Even without GPU acceleration or symmetry implimention, we have achieved the bond dimension of 9 and obtained accurate ground-state energy and consistent order parameters compared to prior studies. In particular, we confirm the existence of an intermediate empty-plaquette valence bond solid ground state in the Shastry-Sutherland model. We have further discussed the convergence of the algorithm and its potential improvements. Our work provides a promising route for large-scale tensor network calculations of two-dimensional quantum systems.

Abstract: It is generally argued that Mermin-Wagner theorem excludes the possibility of long-range order in two dimensional bosonic systems at non-zero temperatures. In contrast, we show here that generic bilayer semiconductors could demonstrate true Bose-Einstein condensation of interlayer excitons. We show that the key requirements include (i) reduction of the interlayer band gap using an applied electric field so that excitons spontaneously appear in the ground state, (ii) band structure that allows for long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and (iii) a finite magnetic field. Our results indicate that superfluidity and ferroelectric order can co-exist in two dimensional excitonic insulators.

Abstract: The ferroelectric semiconductor α-GeTe(111) has attracted significant attention in the last decade due to its unique properties, with extensive studies focusing on its occupied electronic bandstructure. In contrast, its unoccupied states - particularly those near the conduction band minimum - remain largely unexplored. In an effort to characterize those states, we surprisingly observe three image potential states (IPS) in α-GeTe(111) extending up to 0.8 eV above the vacuum level. Using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we resolve the full parabolic dispersions of the first three IPS and determine their binding energies. Our analysis, combined with Bloch spectral function calculations, reveals that the unexpected persistence of IPS above the vacuum level originates from strong dipole transitions and the presence of large electron reservoirs in GeTe.

Motivation: Understanding the excited state landscape of squaraine dyes is important due to their potential applications in light-based technologies, especially for visible light photocatalysis. Previous studies have limited knowledge about their excited states beyond the visible region.

Method: The study combines ground-state and excited-state absorption spectroscopy with transient absorption anisotropy experiments in the ultraviolet region up to 6.5 eV. It also employs a suite of ab initio methods, including TDDFT, BSE, and n-electron valence perturbation theory on a CASSCF/NEVPT2 basis, supplemented by vibronic simulations and two-photon absorption measurements.

Result: A consistent picture of the optical behavior of SQIB is provided, with twelve electronically excited states assigned to the experimental data, enhancing understanding of their excited states in the visible and ultraviolet regions.

Conclusion: The research advances the understanding of squaraine dyes' photophysical properties across the visible and ultraviolet Spectrum, which could support their use in light-driven applications.

Abstract: Although squaraine dyes are commonly praised as candidates for light-based applications, little is known about their excited state landscape beyond the low-energy visible light region. Our work aims for an improved understanding of the photophysical properties of squaraines at the example of N-isobutyl substituted anilino-squaraine (SQIB) by extending ground-state and excited-state absorption spectroscopy of the molecule into the ultraviolet up to 6.5~eV. In addition, we distinguish the relative transition dipole moments of the excited state absorption peaks with the help of transient absorption anisotropy experiments. To relate experimental features to specific states, we employ a set of ab initio methods including time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and n-electron valence perturbation theory on top of a self-consistent complete active space (CASSCF/NEVPT2). Our assignment is complemented by vibronic simulations and a discussion of two-photon absorption measurements. Through this joint effort, we are able to provide a consistent picture of the optical behavior of SQIB across the visible and ultraviolet light regime, and assign a total of twelve electronically excited states to our experimental data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel 'electrodrying' mechanism for controlling nanopores in iontronic devices, enabling bidirectional conductance regulation and memristor-like behavior, with experiments validating the concept.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need for advanced iontronic devices inspired by biological systems, such as neuromorphic devices, has driven research into alternative ways to control nanopores at the micro and nanoscale level. The discovery of memristor-like behavior in these devices could open new possibilities for bio-inspired computing.

Method: The study combines analytical modeling with free-energy molecular dynamics simulations to propose and explain the electrodrying mechanism. Experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores were conducted to validate the theoretical findings.

Result: Electrodrying in nanopores allows for bidirectional conductance control with significant hysteresis, a fifth memristor type (negative differential resistance), and shows potential for applications in neuromorphic circuits and memory tasks.

Conclusion: This research advances the understanding of iontronic devices by introducing a new control mechanism that could enhance their functionality and integrate them into biological and computing systems.

Abstract: Iontronics is a burgeoning paradigm that employs ions in solution as information carriers for sensing and computing, e.g., in neuromorphic devices. The fundamentally different working principle as compared to electronics requires novel approaches and concepts to control the impedance of nanoscale fluidic circuit elements, such as nanopores. For instance, previous research has focused on voltage-induced pore wetting as a means to trigger conduction in nanopores. The present study explores the opposite counter-intuitive mechanism: using voltage to dry hydrophobic nanopores and, therefore, to turn off conduction. This "electrodrying" concept affords exquisite, bidirectional control over the conductance of nanopores additionally showing hysteresis in the current-voltage curve that is the fingerprint of memristors. Using an analytical model and free-energy molecular dynamics simulations, we explain the physical mechanism underlying electrodrying and provide clear design criteria for solid-state and biological nanopores with bidirectional control over conductance. The electrical behaviour of electrodrying nanopores shows two unique features: i) the hysteresis loop is shifted from the origin, accounting for the fifth, previously unreported memristor type and ii) negative differential resistance is observed over a broad voltage range in which the non-conductive state is favoured by electrodrying. These properties are demonstrated in a short-term memory task and in an iontronic oscillator circuit to showcase their potential in neuromorphic applications and iontronic devices. Finally, we validate our predictions through experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores, whose voltage-dependent conductance substantiates the electrodrying concept.

Abstract: We present an investigation into the role of anode grid pitch and excitation spectrum on the performance of high-power optoelectronic switches utilizing Fe-doped $β$-Ga$_2$O$3$. By systematically varying the anode grid pitch ($20-80\ μ\text{m}$) and the excitation spectrum ($235-500\ \text{nm}$), we identify a crucial sub-bandgap regime, centered at $272\ \text{nm}$, that effectively activates deep-level defect states. This activation is shown to enable highly efficient bulk carrier transport, a significant contrast to conventional above-bandgap excitation which is hampered by shallow surface absorption. The sub-bandgap illumination promotes strong photocurrent generation and substantially improved carrier collection efficiency. Under optimized conditions, specifically utilizing a $40\ μ\text{m}$ anode pitch, the fabricated device achieves a high peak photocurrent of $4.14\ \text{A}$ and a record-low on-resistance of $10.4\ Ω$. To quantify this simultaneous high-performance achievement, we introduce a responsivity-conductance figure of merit ($\text{FoM}{_{RC}}$), which attains a record value of $4.7 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{S/W}$. These findings robustly demonstrate the superior suitability of Fe-doped $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ for next-generation high-power optoelectronic switching applications, enabling reliable ampere-level photocurrents coupled with minimized on-resistance through strategic device geometry optimization and sub-bandgap excitation.

This numerical model lays the groundwork for future research on mitigating or even permanently solving EIBD problems in electric motor bearings.

The majority of studies in this field are classified as engineering, with 34% of publications in this area. The USA leads the way with over 160 publications, followed by China with 125. Two institutions in the USA are particularly prominent in this field: Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico with 22 publications, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado with 16 publications. The second institution is the University of Science and Technology of China, which has published 17 articles on the subject. A close examination of the evolution of keywords reveals a remarkable transformation in the scientific landscape over the past 10 years, from 2013 to 2023. The evolution of keywords suggests a maturation in the understanding of fire risks associated with photovoltaic energy. A total of seven scientific communities have been identified in which these works are grouped according to their keywords. These include Fire and Energy Storage, PV faults, Fire resistance, Fire hazard, Fire detectors, Deep learning, and Fire safety. It has been found that fires caused by PV installations are not listed as a cause of fire starts. This should be taken into account when conducting preventive analyses of this potential danger, particularly in light of the possible development of agrivoltaics, where facilities will be mainly located in the natural environment.

### [92] [Sensor free, self regulating thermal switching via anomalous Ettingshausen effect and spin reorientation in DyCo5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14335)
*Shibo Wang,Hiroki Tsuchiura,Nobuaki Terakado*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A sensor-free thermal switch using rare earth cobalt based on anomalous Ettingshausen effect and spin reorientation transition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal management in electronic devices is essential due to increasing power densities, nanoscale features, and high switching speeds, necessitating efficient thermal control solutions without external sensors.

Method: Combined theoretical analysis using density functional theory and Kubo formalism with experimental data to study anomalous Hall conductivity and anomalous Nernst conductivity.

Result: Strong intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity; highly anisotropic anomalous Nernst conductivity showing two orders of magnitude difference in the SRT temperature window; anomalous Nernst thermopower and Ettingshausen coefficient demonstrate robust orientation-controlled switching under fixed in-plane bias current.

Conclusion: Materials-based approach to compact thermal control without sensors or feedback electronics is viable and can be implemented in existing ferromagnetic devices.

Abstract: We propose a sensor free, self regulating thermal switch that combines the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE) with a temperature driven spin reorientation transition (SRT) in the rare earth cobalt compound DyCo$_5$. Using density functional theory and the Kubo linear-response formalism, we compute the anomalous Hall conductivity $σ_{xy}(\varepsilon)$ and the finite temperature anomalous Nernst conductivity $α_{xy}(T)$ for two magnetization directions, magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c axis. While the intrinsic $σ_{xy}$ at the Fermi level remains sizable for both orientations, $α_{xy}$ exhibits an about two orders of magnitude contrast in the SRT temperature window. This contrast is consistent with the low temperature Mott relation through the energy slope $\partial_\varepsilon σ_{xy}(\varepsilon)\rvert_{E_{\mathrm F}}$ and is traced to strongly peaked Berry curvature hot spots generated by spin orbit coupling induced avoided crossings of Co $3d$ bands. Combining $α_{xy}$ with longitudinal transport coefficients, we estimate device level metrics, namely the anomalous Nernst thermopower $S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$ and the Ettingshausen coefficient $Π_{\mathrm{AEE}}=T S_{\mathrm{ANE}}$, and demonstrate robust orientation controlled switching under a fixed in plane bias current. These results establish a materials based route to compact thermal control without external sensors or feedback electronics and provide a concrete example that the proposed principle can be realized in an existing ferromagnet.

Abstract: In this letter, we present an innovative design for a compact, high-efficiency all-polarization receiving rectenna tailored for wireless power transmission. This rectenna, which integrates an antenna with two same rectifier units, employs direct conjugate matching of antenna impedance to rectifier impedance. This approach eliminates the necessity for an external impedance-matching network, thereby reducing the overall dimensions of the rectenna. The implementation of virtual ground concept streamlines the design of the rectifier's output filter. The low-profile antenna, engineered for operation at 2.45 GHz, demonstrates high conversion efficiency across all polarization angles. The measured RF-to-DC efficiency exceeds 63% for all polarization angles, achieving a peak efficiency of 82.2%.

Abstract: The nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction are fundamental geometric features that encode critical information regarding particle statistics and their interaction. Directly probing these structures, particularly in correlated quantum systems, remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we provide rigorous results on the structure of the many-body wavefunction and propose to use an interferometric technique to probe its zeros in ultra-cold atomic systems. Specifically, we refer to the so-called heterodyne interferometric reconstruction of the phase of the many-body wavefunction. We prove that the sought nodal surfaces show up as specific discontinuities in the interference fringes. Following Leggett, both `symmetry-dictated' nodal surfaces, due to particle statistics, and `non-symmetry dictated' nodal surfaces emerging from interaction effects, can be probed. We demonstrate how the spin degrees of freedom, effectively modifying the structure of the nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction, leave distinct fingerprints in the resulting interference pattern. Our work addresses important features of the structure of the many-body wavefunction that are broadly relevant for quantum science ranging from conceptual aspects to computational questions of extended systems and quantum simulation.

Abstract: Dipolar quantum gases, encompassing atoms and molecules with significant dipole moments, exhibit unique long-range and anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions (DDI), distinguishing them from systems dominated by short-range contact interactions. This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena.

Abstract: We determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of a one-dimensional disordered Bose gas using bosonization and the nonperturbative functional renormalization group (RG). We discuss two different scenarios, based on distinct truncations of the effective action. In the first scenario, the Bose glass is destabilized at any finite temperature, giving rise to a normal fluid. Nevertheless, one can distinguish a low-temperature glassy regime, where disorder plays an important role on intermediate length and time scales, from a high-temperature regime, where disorder becomes irrelevant. In the second scenario, below a temperature $T_c$, the RG flow exhibits a singularity at a finite value of the RG momentum scale. We propose that this singularity signals a lack of thermalization and the existence of a localized phase for $T<T_c$. We provide a description of this low-temperature localized phase within a droplet picture and highlight a number of possible similarities with characteristics of many-body localized phases, including non-thermal behavior, avalanche instabilities and many-body resonances, the structure of the many-body spectrum, and slow dynamics in the ergodic phase. The normal fluid above $T_c$, and below a crossover temperature $T_g$, exhibits glassy properties on intermediate scales.

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular cooling have enabled the realization of strongly dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of molecules, and BECs of many different molecular species may become experimentally accessible in the near future. Here, we explore the unique properties of such BECs and the new insights they may offer into dipolar quantum fluids and many-body physics. We explore which parameter regimes can realistically be achieved using currently available experimental techniques, discuss how to implement these techniques, and outline which molecular species are particularly well suited to explore exotic new states of matter. We further determine how state-of-the-art beyond mean-field theories, originally developed for weakly dipolar magnetic gases, can be pushed to their limits and beyond, and what other long-standing questions in the field of dipolar physics may realistically come within reach using molecular systems.

Abstract: We present a general formalism for performing a time-dependent Bogoliubov analysis of a dynamically unstable Bose-Einstein condensate, which extends the quasiparticle projection method of Morgan et al. [Phys. Rev. A 57, 3818 (1998)] to cases with a complex spectrum. By introducing the proper left eigenvectors associated with each regime, we construct a biorthogonal basis. While the usual Bogoliubov normalization $\langle u | u \rangle - \langle v | v \rangle = 1$ may not hold in this basis, it still allows for a complete mode decomposition and an accurate reconstruction of arbitrary perturbations over time. This approach extends the applicability of the Bogoliubov framework beyond the stable regime, providing a consistent analysis of the time evolution of unstable condensates. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a one-dimensional condensate with attractive interactions, which is dynamically unstable and evolves into nonstationary localized structures seeded by small perturbations.

Abstract: Shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) represent a paradigmatic instance of quantum fluids in hollow geometries exhibiting phenomena that bridge from ultracold atomic to astrophysical realms. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of the dynamics, thermodynamics, and collective excitations of shell-shaped BECs, synthesizing two decades of our group's theoretical work in light of recent experimental breakthroughs. We begin by analyzing the evolution of a BEC from filled-sphere to hollow-shell geometries, illustrating the necessity of microgravity conditions to avoid gravitational sag. We then analyze collective modes structure across this evolution and pinpoint a universal dip in the frequency spectra as well as mode reconfiguration due to inner-surface excitations as robust signatures of the hollowing-out transition. Turning to vortex physics, we show that the closed-surface topology enforces vortex-antivortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs and that the natural annihilation of these pairs can be stabilized by rotation, with the critical rotation rate depending on shell thickness. In the thermodynamic domain, we investigate the interplay between shell inflation and the BEC phase transition, where adiabatic expansions lead to condensate depletion. This behavior motivates a study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of shell-shaped BECs; we perform such a study by constructing a time-dependent dynamic technique that can capture the evolution in both adiabatice and non-adiabatic regimes. Finally, we review recent experimental realizations of shell-shaped BECs, including the landmark creation of ultracold shells aboard the International Space Station, and outline prospects for exploring quantum fluids in curved geometries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries.

Abstract: This paper investigates the formation of Spin Faraday waves in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate under the stripe phase and explores the dispersion relation under three different phases. We discover that the SFW exhibit temporal and spatial patterns when the interaction is modulated periodically, and appear with resonant waves and higher order harmonics. SFW can be excited even when the modulation frequency resonates with the trap frequency. Furthermore, we study the dispersion relation of these Faraday modes through periodic modulation, which agrees well with our theoretical results under three quantum phases. Our work indicates novel physical phenomena originating from the introduction of spin-orbit coupling and provides a possible method for studying the dispersion of Bose gases.

Motivation: Understanding the applicability limits of Leggett's bound is important for studying superfluidity in different regimes of Bose-Einstein condensates.

Method: Combined quantum Monte Carlo, Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and field-theory calculations to study strong interactions in 2D-1D crossover.

Result: Leggett's bound serves as reliable estimator only in mean-field regime; in strongly interacting cases at 2D-1D crossover, its accuracy decreases.

Conclusion: While Leggett's bound works well in mean-field, additional studies are needed to validate its application in strongly interacting systems, particularly at dimensionality crossovers.

Abstract: A density-based superfluid bound called Leggett's bound has been proved to be a good estimator of the superfluid fraction for cold atomic gases in the mean-field regime. Here, we investigate the accuracy of such bound in the strongly interacting regime, where the mean-field approach fails. Combining quantum Monte Carlo, Gross-Pitaevskii equation and field-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the bound serves as a reliable estimator of the superfluid fraction for strongly interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover at low temperatures. By further presenting two counterexamples where the bound predicts trivial results, we shed light on the conditions under which the Leggett's bound serves as a good predictor.

TL;DR: A macroscopic method for reconstructing RPC efficiency curves and parameters is developed using Geant4 simulations and experimental data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research focuses on improving the understanding and reconstruction of RPC (Radiochromic Film) performance, which is crucial for applications in particle detection and radiation measurements.

Method: The authors use Geant4 simulations to model the energy deposition and ionization processes in RPCs. They incorporate an induced-charge effect by introducing an efficiency gain function G(E). To calibrate the system, they compare simulated results with experimental data from the CMS detector. This calibration fixes the absolute scale of RPC parameters. They also apply this calibration to alternative RPC mixtures to assess their efficiency and working points, enabling a way to screen without requiring detailed microscopic transport models.

Result: The developed method successfully reconstructs efficiency Curves and operating points for RPC mixtures, including eco-friendly alternatives, providing a macroscopic approach that bypasses the need for microscopic transport simulations.

Conclusion: This work offers a practical and efficient solution for RPC performance analysis, applicable to both standard and alternative mixtures, thereby advancing radiation detection techniques and material optimization in related fields.

Abstract: A macroscopic reconstruction is developed to infer iRPC performance using Geant4 observables and one experimental anchor. The Geant4 energy deposition is used to estimate the primary ionization yield, while the efficiency turn-on is modeled through an induced-charge description encoded in an effective gain G(E). The absolute scale is fixed by calibrating the standard CMS mixture to its GIF++ efficiency curve and extracting macroscopic Townsend parameters (A,B). The same procedure is propagated to four alternative mixtures, including two HFO and CO2 eco-friendly blends, to reconstruct efficiency curves and working points, enabling detector mixture screening without microscopic transport inputs.

Abstract: The Filling, Overflow, and Circulation (FOC) system is a critical subsystem of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), responsible for the safe handling of the Liquid Scintillator (LS) and water throughout the detector's commissioning and operational lifetime. This paper details the design and operation of the FOC system, which accomplished the filling of the world's largest LS detector--taking 45 days for water (6.4*10^4 m^3) and 200 days for LS (2.3*10^4 m^3). Throughout water filling, the liquid level difference between the Central Detector and Water Pool was rigorously maintained within safety limits. During LS filling, level control achieved +/-2 cm precision with flow regulation within +/-0.5% of setpoints. An automated control system based on Programmable Logic Controllers and the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System framework ensured reliable operation. The system preserved LS radiopurity, maintaining 222Rn below 1 mBq/m^3 during filling and achieving 238U/232Th concentrations below 10^-16 g/g. The successful commissioning and operation of the FOC system have established it as an indispensable foundation for the stable long-term operation of the JUNO detector.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to provide accurate data on the ambient neutron flux and spectrum in deep underground environments, which is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutron-sensitive experiments.

Method: The paper describes the ALMOND design, its calibration using known neutron sources, and the techniques used to measure ambient neutrons in the underground setting.

Result: Initial measurements from ALMOND yielded specific neutron flux and spectrum characteristics consistent with ambient conditions at LNGS.

Conclusion: ALMOND effectively measures ambient neutrons, enabling better shielding and shielding mechanisms for underground experiments.

Abstract: In deep underground laboratories, environmental neutrons, which are produced at the cavern walls, introduce a source of background to rare event searches. The flux and spectrum of the ambient neutrons vary considerably with time and location. Precise knowledge of this background is necessary to devise shielding and veto mechanisms, thereby improving the sensitivity of the neutron-susceptible underground experiments. ALMOND, currently in operation, is a low-flux mobile neutron spectrometer developed for the LNGS underground laboratory to measure the ambient neutron background of the entire facility. In this paper, an overview of the design, construction and calibration of ALMOND is given. Furthermore, the result of the first underground neutron measurement is shown along with an outlook for future measurements and analyses.

Operating in the backward region ($-3.5 \lesssim η\lesssim -1.5$), the pfRICH is designed to achieve at least $3σ$ separation among pions, kaons, and protons up to $7,\mathrm{GeV}/c$ for Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering measurements. Using a standalone Geant4 simulation of the pfRICH, we develop a hybrid machine-learning approach that combines convolutional neural-network-based feature extraction with gradient-boosted decision-tree classifiers. This method significantly enhances Cherenkov-ring pattern recognition and improves particle-separation performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid machine-learning techniques for next-generation Cherenkov detectors at the EIC.

Abstract: We derive a novel variant of the Blaszak-Szum lattice equation by introducing a new class of trigonometric-type bilinear operators. By employing Hirota's bilinear method, we obtain the Gram-type determinant solution of the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation. One-soliton and two-soliton solutions are constructed, with a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of the two-soliton solution. A Bäcklund transformation for the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation is established. By virtue of this Bäcklund transformation, multi-lump solutions of the equation are further constructed. Rational solutions are derived by introducing two differential operators applied to the determinant elements; in particular, lump solutions derived via these differential operators can be formulated in terms of Schur polynomials. Through parameter variation, three types of breather solutions are obtained, including the Akhmediev breather, Kuznetsov-Ma breather, and a general breather that propagates along arbitrary oblique trajectories. Finally, numerical three-periodic wave solutions to the variant Blaszak-Szum lattice equation are computed using the Gauss-Newton method.

Abstract: We develop a geometric atlas of dynamical regimes on the rotation group SU(2), combining geodesic flows, heavy rigid body dynamics, and a curvature-based decomposition of the Euler-Poisson equations. We represent the equations of motion in a curvature form that interprets rigid-body motion as the interaction of inertial and external curvature fields. This unified viewpoint recovers classical integrable cases (Lagrange, Kovalevskaya, Goryachev-Chaplygin) from a single geometric mechanism and clarifies their geodesic prototypes on SU(2). The central new result is the identification and geometric explanation of a pure-precession family in the inertia ratio (2,2,1), obtained from a curvature-balanced geodesic regime with the same inertia ratio. The corresponding pure-precession regime for the (2,2,1) heavy top was first identified in previous work; here we place it into a curvature-based atlas and interpret it as a balance between inertial and external curvature fields. We also exhibit a schematic curvature diagram organizing the main dynamical regimes. Finally, we outline GCCT (Geometric Curvature Control Theory), a curvature-driven approach to control on S^3 designed to produce smooth globally regular controls suitable for benchmark maneuvers; a detailed comparison with Pontryagin-type optimal solutions is left for future work.

### [109] [Modular connectivity in neural networks emerges from Poisson noise-motivated regularisation, and promotes robustness and compositional generalisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13707)
*Daoyuan Qian,Qiyao Liang,Ila Fiete*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The brain’s circuits exhibit modular architectures to factorize complex tasks, enabling compositionally generalizable solutions and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. While modular solutions are challenging in ANNs due to vanishing subspaces, introducing activity-dependent neural noise and nonlinear responses can drive the emergence of accurate modular solutions, akin to acquiring a correct world model. A deterministic regularizer combining weights and activations multiplicatively captures this phenomenon, which isn’t evident in linear networks or standard regularizations. Pre-modularized ANNs exhibit superior noise robustness, generalization, and extrapolation beyond training data compared to ANNs without such inductive biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores how ANNs can exhibit modular architectures, mimicking the brain's efficiency in handling complex tasks, and how noise and nonlinear responses can facilitate such modularity.

Method: The authors introduce neural noise and a deterministic regularizer that combines weights and activations multiplicatively. They demonstrate that pre-modularized ANNs outperform standard ANNs in noise robustness, generalization, and extrapolation.

Result: The modularized ANNs achieve superior noise robustness and better generalization and extrapolation than standard ANNs, suggesting that introducing inductive biases like pre-modularization can enhance ANNs' ability to factorize tasks akin to the brain.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that modular architectures and specific regularizers can be beneficial for ANNs, potentially by encoding modular solutions that mimic the brain's processing. This supports the idea of designing ANNs with inductive biases that facilitate modular learning and improved generalization.

Abstract: Circuits in the brain commonly exhibit modular architectures that factorise complex tasks, resulting in the ability to compositionally generalise and reduce catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to mix all processing, because modular solutions are difficult to find as they are vanishing subspaces in the space of possible solutions. Here, we draw inspiration from fault-tolerant computation and the Poisson-like firing of real neurons to show that activity-dependent neural noise, combined with nonlinear neural responses, drives the emergence of solutions that reflect an accurate understanding of modular tasks, corresponding to acquisition of a correct world model. We find that noise-driven modularisation can be recapitulated by a deterministic regulariser that multiplicatively combines weights and activations, revealing rich phenomenology not captured in linear networks or by standard regularisation methods. Though the emergence of modular structure requires sufficiently many training samples (exponential in the number of modular task dimensions), we show that pre-modularised ANNs exhibit superior noise-robustness and the ability to generalise and extrapolate well beyond training data, compared to ANNs without such inductive biases. Together, our work demonstrates a regulariser and architectures that could encourage modularity emergence to yield functional benefits.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate quantitative assessment of metabolic cost during static posture holding is a strategically important problem in biomechanics and physiology. Traditional metrics such as ``time under tension'' are fundamentally insufficient, because they are scalar quantities that ignore the temporal history of deviations, that is, the microdynamics of posture, which has nontrivial energetic consequences. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded methodology to address this problem by introducing the concept of the \textbf{deviation absement} ($Δ\mathcal{A}_\ell$), defined as the time integral of the deviation of the muscle--tendon unit length from a reference value.
  We rigorously prove that, for a broad class of quasi-static models, absement appears as the leading first-order state variable. For small deviations in a neighbourhood of a reference posture, the total metabolic cost $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{met}}(\ell)$ admits a universal asymptotic expansion of the form \begin{equation*} \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{met}}(\ell) = P_0 T + C_1 Δ\mathcal{A}_\ell + C_2 \int_0^T(\ell(t)-\ell_0)^2\,dt + O(\|\ell-\ell_0\|_{L^\infty}^3), \end{equation*} where $T$ is the duration of loading, and $P_0, C_1, C_2$ are constants determined by local properties of the system.
  Thus, the deviation absement ($Δ\mathcal{A}_\ell$) is the \textbf{unique first-order sufficient statistic} that allows one to quantify and separate the energetic contribution of systematic drift of the mean posture from the contribution of micro-oscillations (tremor), which is described by the quadratic term. This result has direct consequences for parameter identification: the proposed formalism makes it possible to recover physically meaningful coefficients $(P_0, C_1, C_2)$ by means of linear regression of experimental data obtained from standard kinematic measurements and indirect calorimetry.

Abstract: Intracellular processes often rely on the timely encounter of mobile reaction partners, including intermittently motor-driven organelles. The underlying cytoskeletal network presents a complex landscape that both directs particle movement and introduces quenched disorder through filament organization. We investigate the mean first encounter times for pairs of intermittently processive and diffusive particles, moving in two dimensions with and without a fixed filament network. In unstructured domains, increasing particle run-length enhances exploration of the domain, but tends to slow down the encounter times compared to equivalent diffusing particles. Encounters for long-running particles occur preferentially near the periphery, contrasting with bulk encounters for the purely diffusive case. When particles are unbiased in their runs along dense filament networks, encounters are shown to be well approximated by a continuum run-and-tumble model. For biased particles, regions of convergent filament orientation can serve as traps that slow the overall spatial exploration but can allow for faster encounter rates by funneling particles into regions of reduced dimensionality. These findings provide a framework for estimating intracellular encounter kinetics, highlighting the role of key physical features such as the effective diffusivity, run times, and network architecture.

Abstract: Pancreatic $β$-cells play a central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the pulsatile secretion of insulin. This essential function relies not only on intracellular regulatory mechanisms but also on coordinated interactions among $β$-cells within the islets of Langerhans. Disruptions in this intercellular coordination are increasingly implicated in metabolic disorders such as type~I and type~II diabetes. In this work, we employ a computational framework to investigate the collective dynamics of a network of coupled $β$-cells interacting through a nonlocally coupled ring topology that incorporates both electrical and metabolic coupling pathways. This topology captures short- and long-range interactions known to shape islet communication. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of emergent behaviors, including synchronization, traveling waves, and traveling chimera states, in which coherent and incoherent domains coexist and propagate across the network. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms governing coordinated $β$-cell activity and the regulation of pulsatile insulin secretion. By clarifying how coupling structure and intercellular communication shape islet-wide dynamics, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the dysfunctions underlying diabetes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: It often is emphasized that gene expression is noisy. A seemingly contradictory view is that control mechanisms have been optimized to squeeze as much information as possible out of a limited number of molecules. Here we revisit these issues in a simple model where a single transcription factor (TF) controls a large number of target genes. We include only the physically required noise sources: random arrival of TFs at their targets and counting noise in the synthesis and degradation of mRNA. If the cell has a limited total number of mRNA molecules, then the capacity to transmit information about TF concentration is maximized when these resources are distributed across the largest possible number of target genes. To realize this capacity the distribution of TF concentrations must be biased toward smaller values. Thus, in some limits, information transmission is optimized when individual expression levels are noisy. In addition, the dependence of information transmission on the parameters of this multi-gene system has a "sloppy" spectrum, so that optimal performance can co-exist with substantial variability.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are emerging as a promising approach for quantitative parameter estimation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation and fluorescence imaging techniques allow the cellular morphology of living embryos to be constructed spatiotemporally. These development processes involve numerous molecules distributed at the subcellular scale, such as cell adhesion (E-cadherin), which accumulate at cell-cell interfaces to regulate intercellular connection. However, quantifying molecular distributions within specific subcellular regions across the entire embryo, where cell movement and molecular redistribution occur rapidly, is challenging due to the need for simultaneous cell morphology reconstruction and lineage tracing due to photobleaching and phototoxicity. We report a transformer-based pipeline, CTransformer, that establishes a 4D cellular morphology map before the 550-cell (late) stage. CTransformer constructed 4D cellular morphology atlases, reaching 80% accuracy at the 550-cell stage. Through this advanced architecture, we use only one channel to reconstruct cell morphology and achieve cell tracing. With each cell's morphology as a reference, the distribution of specific molecules throughout the cell body and at cell interfaces can be quantitatively measured in another fluorescence channel. We apply this methodology to track E-cadherin during embryonic development of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, from fertilization to gastrulation. Our results reveal that E-cadherin is tightly regulated across individual embryos, both within single cells and at cell-cell interfaces, displaying an anterior-posterior gradient and cell- and lineage-specific patterns. Furthermore, its spatiotemporal heterogeneity influences cell mechanics and embryonic morphogenesis, helping explain how C. elegans achieves stereotypical developmental patterns at cellular resolution.

### [117] [Electron-positron pair creation induced by multi-pulse train of electric fields: effect of randomness in time-delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13722)
*Deepak Sah,Manoranjan P. Singh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers create electron-positron pairs (EPPs) using alternating-sign, time-dependent electric field pulse trains. They use the quantum Vlasov equations to solve for pair production in Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays. They find that increasing the standard deviation of time delays (σ_T) leads to a dramatic modification of the longitudinal momentum spectrum. Notably, they observe a significant enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function as σ_T increases, which could optimize multi-pulse field configurations for creating EPPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to understand and optimize the conditions for electron-positron pair production in alternating electric field pulse trains. By manipulating the time delays between pulses, they aim to enhance the efficiency of pair production, which has implications for both theoretical physics and potential experimental designs in particle physics.

Method: The researchers solve the quantum Vlasov equations for Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays drawn from a Gaussian distribution. They vary the standard deviation σ_T of the time delay distribution to study its effect on the longitudinal momentum spectrum and the distribution of pair-produced particles.

Result: The key results reveal that increasing σ_T leads to a significant modification in the momentum spectrum. Specifically, a tenfold increase in the central peak is observed for σ_T ≈ 31 (about 17% of the mean time delay) in a 20-pulse train. This enhancement scales up to 10^3 for σ_T ≈ 50 (about 27% of the mean time delay). This finding has important implications for optimizing multi-pulse configurations and maximizing EPP production.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates that by systematically tuning the time delays between pulses in electric field trains, one can significantly enhance the production of electron-positron pairs. The results suggest that researchers can design experiments with optimized multi-pulse configurations to maximize pair production efficiency, opening up new possibilities in high-energy physics experiments and related applications.

Abstract: We investigate the creation of electron-positron pairs (EPPs) in a sequence of alternating-sign, time-dependent electric field pulse trains by solving the quantum Vlasov equations. Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $σ_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $σ_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $σ_T \approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $σ_T \approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation.

Abstract: We propose a Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Quantum Graph Convolutional Network (H-STQGCN) algorithm by combining the strengths of quantum computing and classical deep learning to predict the taxi destination within urban road networks. Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies.

TL;DR: Efficiently simulating all-to-all interacting disordered many-body systems on quantum platforms is challenging, due to interactions mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom. This work shows that a Trotterization scheme can be used to densify the disorder, reducing such undesired correlations.

Conclusion: This work presents a promising method for simulating complex quantum many-body systems by densifying disorder, demonstrating significant progress in overcoming challenges associated with all-to-all interactions and disorder on quantum platforms.

Abstract: All-to-all interacting and disordered many-body systems are notoriously hard to simulate on quantum platforms, as interactions are commonly mediated by auxiliary degrees of freedom that lower the amount of disorder, introducing undesired correlations. In this work, we show how a Trotterization scheme can be effectively utilized to densify the disorder of the model. In particular, we study the statistical properties of the resulting model, as well as Trotterization errors in the simulation that affect the time evolution and dynamical observables. As a concrete example, we propose an implementation via a single-mode cavity QED platform of the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. We analyze several features of the effective model, such as the distribution of the effective couplings, the number of interacting sites, state preparation, and the behavior of quantum chaos probes. We conclude this work with a detailed investigation of the robustness of our findings against dissipation, both analytically and numerically.

Abstract: We present a purely 2D transversal realization of phase gates at any level of the Clifford hierarchy, and beyond, using non-Abelian surface codes. Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup.

Abstract: Zoned neutral atom architectures are emerging as a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Their growing scale, however, creates a critical need for efficient and automated compilation solutions. Yet, existing methods fail to scale to the thousands of qubits these devices promise. State-of-the-art compilers, in particular, suffer from immense memory requirements that limit them to small-scale problems. This work proposes a scalable compilation strategy that "searches smarter, not harder". We introduce Iterative Diving Search (IDS), a goal-directed search algorithm that avoids the memory issues of previous methods, and relaxed routing, an optimization to mitigate atom rearrangement overhead. Our evaluation confirms that this approach compiles circuits with thousands of qubits and, in addition, even reduces rearrangement overhead by 28.1% on average. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qmap.

Abstract: Free probability provides a framework for describing correlations between non-commuting observables in complex quantum systems whose Hilbert-space states follow maximum-entropy distributions. We examine the robustness of this framework under a minimal deviation from freeness: the coupling of a single ancilla qubit to a Haar-distributed quantum circuit of dimension $D0 \gg 1$. We find that, even in this setting, the correlation functions predicted by free probability theory receive corrections of order $O(1)$. These modifications persist at long times, when the dynamics of the coupled system is already ergodic. We trace their origin to non-uniformly distributed stationary quantum states, which we characterize analytically and confirm numerically.

Abstract: We study the statistics of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) after partial measurement on a class of one-dimensional quantum critical states described by Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids at low energies. Using a replica trick to average over measurement outcomes in the charge basis and tools from conformal field theory (CFT), we derive closed-form expressions for the cumulants of MIE. We show that exact Born-averaging over microscopic measurement outcomes becomes equivalent at low energy to averaging over conformal boundary conditions weighted by their corresponding partition functions. Our results yield distinctive critical behavior across all cumulants in the regime where the unmeasured parts of the system are maximally separated. We also obtain the full distribution of the post-measurement entanglement entropy, finding that it is generically bimodal and exhibits fat-tails. We corroborate our analytical predictions by numerical calculations and find good agreement between them.

Conclusion: 环境的下限能量谱和色散指数显著影响两水平系统的量子演化，不同标度行为提供了量子测量和量子信息处理的重要理论参考。

Abstract: We find that when the environment of a two-level system has an energy spectrum with a lower bound but without an upper one, the survival probability of the spontaneous emission of the two-level system scales with the spatial dimension $D$ and the exponent $n$ of the energy dispersion $|\vec{k}|^n$ of the environment in the form $1-αt^{2-D/n}$ in the short-time and in the form $αt^{D/n-2}$ in the long-time regime. The former fractional scaling of the survival probability leads to a quantum Zeno effect with a different scaling of the Zeno time.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the link budget for free-space optical systems involving Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. We develop a detailed model of the satellite-to-ground channel that accounts for the primary physical processes affecting transmittance: atmospheric absorption and scattering, free-space diffraction, and turbulence-induced fluctuations. The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case. We propose a scheme for quantum state tomography performed on states generated by an onboard photon source on an LEO or MEO satellite and transmitted to the optical ground station. This approach enables continuous verification of the quality of quantum resources that can be used to perform quantum protocols within quantum information networks.

TL;DR: Diamond's nitrogen-vacancy centers are used for quantum sensing. Optical methods require microwaves, causing heating and electromagnetic interferences. New optical methods eliminate these issues but need strict alignment. Here, a Bayesian framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry using photoluminescence maps is introduced, which depends on the NV orientation. It can determine the magnetic field vector and NV orientation without strict alignment. This framework models cross-relaxation resonances and incorporates the discrete degeneracies of NV symmetry. Experiments show robust orientation determination and vector-field reconstruction, paving the way for compact and alignment-free NV magnetometers for practical applications.

Motivation: Quantum sensing using diamond's nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers is promising, but traditional methods are limited by microwaves, causing heating and electromagnetic interferences. New methods eliminate these issues but require strict alignment, which is not practical. This paper introduces a new Bayesian framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry that does not require alignment.

Method: The paper introduces a general framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry using photoluminescence maps. It leverages Bayesian inference to determine the magnetic field vector and NV orientation directly from the maps. An analytical model of cross-relaxation resonances enables efficient inference under arbitrary field and orientation configurations. The framework naturally incorporates the discrete degeneracies of the NV symmetry.

Result: The paper presents successful experimental demonstration of robust orientation determination and vector-field reconstruction using the introduced framework. This demonstrates the potential of compact and alignment-free NV magnetometers for practical sensing applications.

Conclusion: This paper provides a significant advancement in diamond-based quantum sensing by presenting a framework that eliminates the need for microwaves and strict alignment. The results show the framework's effectiveness in practical sensing applications, opening new possibilities for scalable and robust quantum sensing technologies.

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide a solid-state platform for quantum sensing. While optically detected magnetic resonance techniques offer high sensitivity, their reliance on microwaves introduces heating and stray electromagnetic fields that can perturb nearby samples. Optical approaches based on cross-relaxation between differently oriented NV centers remove this constraint but have so far required stringent alignment of the external field with crystallographic axes, restricting their practicality. Here we introduce a general framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry at near-zero field that leverages Bayesian inference to extract both the magnetic field vector and the NV orientation directly from photoluminescence maps. An analytical model of cross-relaxation resonances enables efficient inference under arbitrary field and orientation configurations, while naturally incorporating the discrete degeneracies of the NV symmetry. We experimentally demonstrate robust orientation determination and vector-field reconstruction, establishing a general route toward compact and alignment-free NV magnetometers for practical sensing applications.

Motivation: 随着量子处理器的发展，光斑控制的高精确度和稳定性变得尤为重要。然而，现有方法常受邻接位点的光强交叉干扰和远翼背景噪声的影响，导致控制精度下降。为此，探索一种能够有效降低这些误差的新方法具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效、可靠的光学形处理方案，该方案基于数字微镜设备，无需额外的光学元件或机械运动，具有极高的集成度和灵活性，为 trapped-ion 等空间有序量子系统实现了高质量的光斑控制。

Abstract: Holographic beam shaping is a powerful approach for generating individually addressable optical spots for controlling atomic qubits, such as those in trapped-ion quantum processors. However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\,\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit. These results provide a compact, DMD-based solution for low-crosstalk optical holographic qubit addressing that is directly applicable to trapped ions and other spatially ordered quantum systems.

Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are non-equilibrium phases of matter that break the discrete time-translation symmetry and is characterized by a robust subharmonic response in periodically driven quantum systems. Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

*Xinfeng Gao,Olivier Pfister,Stefan Bekiranov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper explores using continuous-variable photonic quantum computing to implement the KvN formalism to simulate classical dynamical systems. The approach leverages quantum computing tools to map classical dynamics onto photonic platforms for both sampling and computing intractable nonlinear behaviors, with applications in harmonic oscillators and nonlinear PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical dynamics can be complex and intractable for conventional simulations, especially when dealing with nonlinearities. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to address these challenges by enabling efficient simulation through quantum algorithms and tools like unitary evolution and quantum linear algebra.

Method: TheCONTINUOUS-variable photonic quantum computing architecture is used to implement the KvN formalism. The method involves mapping classical wavefunctions onto photonic states and utilizing quantum linear operators to simulate the time evolution governed by the KvN Schrödinger-like equation. The position and momentum operators are made commuting to respect classical mechanics principles.

Result: The quantum photonic platform demonstrates successful implementation of the KvN formalism for both the harmonic oscillator and a 1D nonlinear PDE. The simulations show improved efficiency in capturing complex dynamics compared to classical methods, with particular highlights in accurate sampling and computation of intractable nonlinear behaviors.

Conclusion: The KvN formalism, combined with continuous-variable photonic quantum computing, provides a powerful approach to simulating classical dynamical systems. The experimental success suggests that this framework can be extended to more complex systems and potentially revolutionize the study of classical and quantum dynamics in photonic platforms. This work opens new possibilities for using quantum computing to address challenging problems in classical mechanics and nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism recasts classical mechanics in a Hilbert space framework using complex wavefunctions and linear operators, akin to quantum mechanics. Instead of evolving probability densities in phase space (as in Liouville's equation), KvN uses a Schrödinger-like equation for a classical wavefunction, with commuting position and momentum operators. Mapped to quantum computing, KvN offers a promising route to simulate classical dynamical systems using quantum algorithms by leveraging unitary evolution and quantum linear algebra tools, potentially enabling efficient classical-to-quantum mappings without invoking full quantum uncertainty. In this work, we specifically explore the implementation of the KvN approach on continuous-variable photonic quantum computing architectures, with the goals of leveraging quantum simulation for both sampling and computing intractable nonlinear dynamics. We will demonstrate its implementation and feasibility with two problems: the harmonic oscillator and a 1D partial differential equation governing nonlinear dynamics.

Abstract: The anisotropic Rabi model (ARM), which features tunable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) and anti-Jaynes-Cummings (AJC) interactions, has remained challenging to realize fully. We present a circuit QED implementation that provides static control over the ARM parameters. By simultaneously coupling a qubit to a resonator's voltage and current antinodes, we geometrically tune the interaction from pure JC to pure AJC. This control enables novel quantum measurement capabilities, including dispersive shift cancellation and Purcell-suppressed readout. Our work establishes a direct platform for exploring the ARM's full parameter space and its applications in quantum information processing.

Abstract: Dynamical decoupling seeks to mitigate phase decoherence in qubits by applying a carefully designed sequence of effectively instantaneous electromagnetic pulses. Although analytic solutions exist for pulse timings that are optimal under specific noise regimes, identifying the optimal timings for a realistic noise spectrum remains challenging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: This work introduces a symplectic framework for quantum error correcting codes in which local structure is analyzed through an anticode perspective. In this setting, a code is treated as a symplectic space, and anticodes arise as maximal symplectic subspaces whose elements vanish on a prescribed set of components, providing a natural quantum analogue of their classical counterparts. This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features. The notion of anticodes also naturally leads to operations such as puncturing and shortening for symplectic codes, which in turn provide algebraic interpretations of key phenomena in quantum error correction, such as the cleaning lemma and complementary recovery and yield new descriptions of weight enumerators.

Abstract: Reliable charging protocols are crucial for advancing quantum batteries toward practical use. We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol.

### [134] [Regulated reconstruction of long-time spin--boson dynamics and emergent zero-bias transverse measurement primitive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13900)
*Dragomir Davidovic*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: TCL master equations fail at long times because their perturbative generators grow secularly in correlation-dominated areas. A new method regulates this by reconstructing the dynamical map around a Davies reference, using a non-Markovian density-matrix correlator that stays bounded. An exactly solvable benchmark shows how this reconstruction controls the map. Applying it to the spin-boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter-rotating terms cause phase lock-in, irreversible erasing of the relative phase between σ_x eigenspaces, and an effective zero-bias transverse σ_x measurement channel. This effect doesn't appear in the rotating-wave approximation or the Davies weak-coupling limit, demonstrating its non-Markovian origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the long-time behavior of open quantum systems and developing robust master equation techniques that avoid secular growth are fundamental challenges in quantum mechanics. This work addresses these issues through a novel reconstruction approach, offering new insights into the dynamics of correlated systems.

Method: We use a non-Markovian density-matrix correlator in a perturbative expansion of the dynamical map, incorporating resummation techniques to regulate secular growth. The method includes reconstruction around a Davies reference semigroup, avoiding the divergent terms that appear in standard approaches at long times.

Result: The study reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive induced by bath memory and counter-rotating terms. This leads to an effective zero-bias σ_x measurement channel, which cannot be observed in standard perturbative treatments relying on the rotating-wave approximation or Davies weak-coupling assumptions.

Conclusion: This research provides a new framework for analyzing the long-time behavior of open quantum systems by addressing secular growth through non-perturbative resummation techniques. The discovery of an intrinsic measurement-like primitive highlights the importance of considering non-Markovian effects in the dynamics of correlated systems.

Abstract: Time--convolutionless (TCL) master equations can break down at long times: time-local perturbative generators develop secular growth in correlation-dominated regimes. We mitigate this by a regulated, partially resummed reconstruction of the dynamical map around a Davies reference semigroup, expressed through a non--Markovian density-matrix correlator C(t) that remains bounded at late times. An exactly solvable rotating-wave benchmark links generator growth to interference-induced near-zeros of the coherence and shows how the reconstruction regulates the map. Applying the method to the unbiased spin--boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter--rotating terms induce phase lock-in that irreversibly erases the relative phase between $σ_x$ eigenspaces on a finite timescale $t_P$, yielding an effective zero-bias transverse ($σ_x$) measurement channel. The selected transverse basis is not assumed a priori; it follows from the reconstructed reduced dynamics. The effect disappears in the rotating-wave approximation and in the Davies weak-coupling limit, demonstrating its non--Markovian interference origin.

Abstract: Unraveling the mechanisms of ergodicity breaking in complex quantum systems is a central pursuit in nonequilibrium physics. In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems.

Motivation: Demonstrating the feasibility of a fundamentally important quantum computing concept through experiment.

Method: Experiments on a superconducting quantum processor, implementing magic state cultivation and developing a fault-tolerant measurement protocol to assess state fidelity.

Result: Significant reduction in error levels, achieving near-perfect fidelity after cultivation while using only 8% of attempts.

Conclusion: Magic state cultivation provides an efficient method to mitigate resource costs, making it a practical solution for future quantum computing advancements.

Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires a universal gate set, but the necessary non-Clifford gates represent a significant resource cost for most quantum error correction architectures. Magic state cultivation offers an efficient alternative to resource-intensive distillation protocols; however, testing the proposal's assumptions represents a challenging departure from quantum memory experiments. We present an experimental study of magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor. We implement cultivation, including code-switching into a surface code, and develop a fault-tolerant measurement protocol to bound the magic state fidelity. Cultivation reduces the error by a factor of 40, with a state fidelity of 0.9999(1) (retaining 8% of attempts). Our results experimentally establish magic state cultivation as a viable solution to one of quantum computing's most significant challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging HPC systems with quantum accelerators require runtimes that can handle both classical and quantum workloads efficiently, which is a key challenge in high-performance computing.

Method: The authors propose a framework that orchestrates quantum workloads across heterogeneous backends, using IRIS for task scheduling and QIR-EE for execution. They implement quantum circuit cutting to optimize task granularity for better simulator performance.

Result: The framework successfully schedules and executes multiple quantum workloads asynchronously, demonstrating potential improvements in throughput and queue management in early quantum hardware environments.

Conclusion: Scaling hybrid runtimes in diverse systems presents challenges such as coordinated scheduling, classical-quantum interaction management, and backend resource support, which are critical for future advancements in HPC with quantum accelerators.

Abstract: Extreme heterogeneity in emerging HPC systems are starting to include quantum accelerators, motivating runtimes that can coordinate between classical and quantum workloads. We present a proof-of-concept hybrid execution framework integrating the IRIS asynchronous task-based runtime with the XACC quantum programming framework via the Quantum Intermediate Representation Execution Engine (QIR-EE). IRIS orchestrates multiple programs written in the quantum intermediate representation (QIR) across heterogeneous backends (including multiple quantum simulators), enabling concurrent execution of classical and quantum tasks. Although not a performance study, we report measurable outcomes through the successful asynchronous scheduling and execution of multiple quantum workloads. To illustrate practical runtime implications, we decompose a four-qubit circuit into smaller subcircuits through a process known as quantum circuit cutting, reducing per-task quantum simulation load and demonstrating how task granularity can improve simulator throughput and reduce queueing behavior -- effects directly relevant to early quantum hardware environments. We conclude by outlining key challenges for scaling hybrid runtimes, including coordinated scheduling, classical-quantum interaction management, and support for diverse backend resources in heterogeneous systems.

Conclusion: 这一方法为未来的量子设备优化提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Readout error models for noisy quantum devices almost universally assume that measurement noise is classical: the measurement statistics are obtained from the ideal computational-basis populations by a column-stochastic assignment matrix $A$. This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\tildeρ$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its scalable generation in noisy quantum devices remains challenging. Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling, inspired by memory-enabled photonic components, for variational entanglement engineering. The network incorporates physically motivated non-linear activation functions, enhancing expressivity beyond linear variational circuits at fixed depth. By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology.

Abstract: Optically-active solid-state systems such as self-assembled quantum dots, rare-earth ions, and color centers in diamond and SiC are promising candidates for quantum network, computing, and sensing applications. Although the nuclei in these systems naturally lead to electron spin decoherence, they can be repurposed, if they are controllable, as long-lived quantum memories. Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC. Here, we generalize these findings to a wide range of electron-nuclear central-spin systems, including those with spin > 1/2 nuclei, such as in III-V quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth ions, and some color centers. Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Simulating Markovian open quantum systems in the semiclassical regime poses a grand challenge for computational physics, as the highly oscillatory nature of the dynamics imposes prohibitive resolution requirements on traditional grid-based methods. To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking.

### [143] [QBism, Polishing Some Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14122)
*Christopher A. Fuchs,Blake C. Stacey*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: QBism presents a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics, emphasizing the role of the observer's personal experience in shaping quantum probabilities. It critiques traditional interpretations for their handling of measurement and probability, arguing that quantum probabilities remain subjective. The framework addresses inconsistencies with Bohr's realism, the Everett interpretation, Bell inequalities, and Wigner's measurement problem, suggesting a radical form of indeterminism. The ontological lesson from QBism points to a potential future where quantum theory continues to evolve, possibly by rejecting objective reality in favor of a more inherently subjective understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks to provide a clear and unified framework for understanding QBism by highlighting its core principles and addressing common interpretative challenges in quantum mechanics.

Method: The analysis method begins by outlining QBism's tenets: the Born Rule as a normative principle, the subjectivity of all probabilities, and the personal nature of measurement outcomes. It then evaluates how these tenets resolve interpretative issues and what ontological implications they hold.

Result: The analysis demonstrates that QBism offers a compelling alternative to traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics by addressing interpretative challenges and proposing a new understanding of quantum probabilities as inherently personal and subjective.

Conclusion: QBism represents a significant shift in quantum interpretations, emphasizing the observer's role in the quantum realm. Its implications suggest a future where quantum theory continues to evolve, possibly moving beyond traditional realism to embrace a more flexible, subjective ontological framework.

Abstract: QBism pursues the real by first eliminating the elements of quantum theory too fragile to be ontologies on their own. Thereafter, it seeks an "ontological lesson" from whatever remains. Here, we explore this program by highlighting three tenets of QBism. First, the Born Rule is a normative statement. It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive "law of nature." Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no "ontic hold" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's "suspended animation" argument. Finally, we consider the ontological lesson of the tenets and ask what it might mean for the next one hundred years of quantum theory and humankind more generally.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper investigates how the confinement of a single ion in a modified Paul trap affects its informational properties; they show that the curvature of the effective potential, not the trap frequency or lattice strength, determines these properties, offering a clear advantage for quantum control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precision quantum control and understanding informational properties of trapped ions are key to advancing quantum computing and sensing technologies.

Method: The authors analyze the system by varying trap frequency (ω) and lattice strength (κ), measuring Fisher information, Shannon entropy, and Fisher-Shannon complexity to track changes in effective potential curvature.

Result: Curvature of the effective potential ω_eff = ω²√(1-κ) dictates the informational properties of the ion; this curvature can be engineered independently of the trap's harmonic characteristics.

Conclusion: This work establishes a method to manipulate informational properties through the effective potential's curvature, providing a foundation for precise quantum control and experiments on ion confinement.

Abstract: In this work, we examine how the informational and structural properties of a single ion respond to controlled changes of the effective potential in a Paul trap modified by an optical lattice. We consider the ground state of the system where confinement is strongest. And by treating the trap frequency $ω$ and lattice $κ$ as independent tunning parameters, we show that Fisher information, Shannon entropy, and Fisher-Shannon complexity track the curvature of the effective potential $ω_{\mathrm{eff}}=ω^2\,\sqrt{1-κ}$. The $ω$ and $κ$ sweeps confirm that curvature and not the choice of control parameter determines the behaviour of the system. This gives the trapped-ion platform a clear advantage that the curvature can be engineered without altering the harmonic characteristics of the system. The interplay between $ω$ and $κ$ thus provides a practical route for precision quantum control and offers Information-theoretic framework for experiments that probe confinement, quantization scale, and information flow in engineered ion traps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  studying quantum-optical phenomena like high-order harmonic generation (HHG) is crucial for advancing ultrashort laser technology and understanding fundamental nonlinear processes in quantum mechanics.

Method:  developed a perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture to derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to emitter dynamics, particularly focusing on HHG.

Result:  the new framework shows improved accuracy in predicting key observables in parameter regimes relevant to current experiments, reveals how nonclassical light characteristics (e.g., squeezing) depend on the number of emitters, and provides scaling relations for nonclassical behavior in large ensembles of emitters.

Conclusion:  this work bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations in quantum optics, offering a powerful new tool for studying complex quantum phenomena such as HHG.

Abstract: Quantum-optical descriptions of strong-field processes have attracted significant attention in recent years. Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schrödinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schrödinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments.

Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) represent a promising fusion of quantum computing and neural network architectures, offering speed-ups and efficient processing of high-dimensional, entangled data. A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping.

We show that a QNN can predict cloud cover with a performance similar to a classical NN with the same number of free parameters and significantly better than the traditional scheme. We also analyse the learning capability of the QNN in comparison to the classical NN and show that, at least for our example, QNNs learn more consistent relationships than classical NNs.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了缩减门信息量的解码器可以有效缓解量子计算中的通信速率限制，为实用的量子计算提供了可行的技术途径。

Abstract: Surface codes are a popular error-correction route to fault-tolerant quantum computation. The so-called exponential backlog problem that can arise when one has to do logical $T$-gates within the surface code demands real-time decoding of the syndrome information to diagnose the appropriate Pauli frame in which to do the gate. This in turn puts a minimum requirement on the communication rate between the quantum processing unit, where the syndrome information is collected, and the classical processor, where the decoding algorithm is run. This minimum communication rate can be difficult to achieve while preserving the quality of the quantum processor. Here, we present two decoders that make use of a reduced syndrome information volume, relying on a number of syndrome bits that scale only as the width -- and not the usual area -- of the surface-code patch. This eases the communication requirements necessary for real-time decoding.

### [149] [General Quantum Instruction for Communication via Maximally Entangled $n$-Qubit States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14280)
*Saba Arife Bozpolat*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A generalized n-bit superdense coding protocol is introduced, transmitting n classical bits using an n-qubit entangled system and n-1 qubits, encoding with Pauli-Z and X gates, and testing on IBM quantum hardware shows success rates decrease with longer messages, due to increased Pauli-X usage for messages with more '1's. Error mitigation strategies include segmenting messages and improving qubit coherence/fidelity. The protocol provides a scalable quantum communication method with applications in networks and systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superdense coding is a fundamental quantum communication protocol, and its generalization to n-qubit systems is crucial for advancing quantum internet technologies. This research addresses the practical challenges in scaling the protocol, making it applicable for real-world quantum networks.

Method: The study introduces an n-bit encoding routine, designs scalable quantum circuits using Qiskit 2.0, and validates the protocol on IBM's quantum hardware for various message lengths (4, 6, 8, 10 bits). They measure success rates and analyze the impact of circuit depth, gate count, and Pauli-X gate usage, particularly for messages with higher '1's density.

Result: The experimental results indicate that success rates decrease with longer messages, longer circuit depths, and higher gate counts, primarily due to increased Pauli-X gate usage. For messages with more '1's, the error rate increases, affecting overall success probability.

Conclusion: The proposed n-bit superdense coding protocol is scalable but requires further improvements in error correction and qubit stability. The protocol offers a practical approach for quantum communication, paving the way for future developments in quantum networks and systems.

Abstract: This study presents a generalized $n$-bit superdense coding protocol that enables the transmission of n classical bits of information using an entangled n--qubit quantum system and the transmission of $n-1$ qubits. The protocol involves creating a maximally entangled n--qubit state, encoding the classical message with Pauli--Z and Pauli--X gates, and then transmitting and decoding the message via quantum communication, quantum operations, and measurements. The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1" bits. Strategies to improve performance include sending messages in shorter segments and advances in qubit coherence and gate fidelity. This work offers a practical and easily scalable quantum communication instruction with potential applications in quantum networks and communication systems.

Abstract: We establish a universal geometric framework that transforms the search for optimal nonlocal operators from a combinatorial black box into a deterministic predict-verify operation. We discover that the principal eigenvalue governing nonlocality is rigorously dictated by a low-dimensional manifold parameterized by merely two fundamental angular variables, $θ$ and $φ$, whose symmetry leads to further simplification. This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators. This distinction offers a novel structural classification of quantum phase transitions and provides a precision navigation chart for Bell experiments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum measurement resolves a superposition into a definite outcome by correlating it with an observer's memory -- a reality register. While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred. This makes conscious confirmation impossible within standard quantum mechanics. We show that nonlinear operations beyond the standard theory could, in principle, enable verifiable and deliberate navigation. Our results shift multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation toward a concrete -- though fundamentally constrained -- quantum-informational framework.

Abstract: Classical thermodynamics is a theory based on coarse-graining, meaning that the thermodynamic variables arise from discarding information related to the microscopic features of the system at hand. In quantum mechanics, however, where one has a high degree of control over microscopic systems, information theory plays an important role in describing the thermal properties of quantum systems. Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics. Finally, we discuss how the geometric and topological properties of these structures may help explain fundamental properties of thermodynamics.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study focuses on estimating molecular ground-state energies using quantum computing, emphasizing the impact of hardware noise. It finds that leakage errors are the primary source of error, obstructing chemical accuracy. Using an ion-trap quantum computer, the researchers prepare the ground state of the H3+ molecule and measure its energy with a noise-resilient method. They also suggest that future developments should focus on reducing leakage errors to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of quantum computing for chemical applications is essential for advancing fields like materials science and drug discovery. Understanding and mitigating noise sources can enhance practical implementations of quantum algorithms.

Method: The researchers implemented adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ ion. They used a noise-resilient iterative quantum phase estimation method for energy measurement. The experiments were conducted on an ion-trap quantum computer without offloading computational tasks to classical computers. The analysis focused on different types of hardware noise, including coherent and incoherent noise, and leakage errors.

Result: The study demonstrates that leakage errors significantly affect the chemical accuracy of molecular energy measurements in quantum computing. While coherent and incoherent noise have limited impact, leakage errors are the main obstacle. The results also suggest that eliminating leakage errors could lead to chemical accuracy, even with shot noise, if future algorithms and hardware improvements focus on this issue.

Conclusion: This research underscores the importance of addressing leakage errors in quantum hardware to achieve chemical accuracy in quantum computing applications for molecular systems.

Abstract: Estimating molecular ground-state energies is a central application of quantum computing, requiring both the preparation of accurate quantum states and efficient energy readout. Understanding the effect of hardware noise on these experiments is crucial to distinguish errors that have low impact, errors that can be mitigated, and errors that must be reduced at the hardware level. We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors. Absent leakage errors, noisy numerical simulations show that with our experimental settings we would have achieved close to chemical accuracy, even shot noise included. These insights highlight the importance of targeting leakage suppression in future algorithm and hardware development.

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to efficiently and accurately solve many important problems in quantum chemistry which elude classical solvers, such as the electronic structure problem of highly correlated materials. Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms. Second, we introduce a novel hybrid approach termed G-AQC-PQC, which generalizes the AQC-PQC method, and combines adiabatic-inspired initialization with the low-memory BFGS optimizer, reducing the quantum computational cost of the method. Third, we compare the accuracy of the methods for chemistry applications using the beryllium hydride molecule (BeH$_2$). We compare the approaches across a number of different choices (ansätze types, depth, discretization steps, initial Hamiltonian, adiabatic schedules and method used). Our results show that the G-AQC-PQC outperforms conventional VQE. We further discuss limitations such as the zero-gradient problem and identify regimes where adiabatically-inspired methods offer a tangible advantage for near-term quantum chemistry applications.

Abstract: We explore the quantum-metrological potential of subwavelength-spaced emitter arrays coupled to a one-dimensional nanophotonic waveguide. In this system, strong dipole--dipole interactions profoundly modify the collective optical response, leading to the emergence of ultranarrow subradiant resonances. Through an eigenmode analysis of the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a universal scaling law for the decay rate of the most subradiant state, which exhibits an $ N^{-3} $ scaling with even-odd oscillatory behavior in the deep-subwavelength regime. This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance. These enhancements remain robust under realistic positional disorder, confirming that dipole--dipole-engineered subradiance provides a viable resource for quantum metrology. Our work bridges many-body waveguide quantum electrodynamics and high-precision sensing, opening a route toward scalable quantum sensors on integrated nanophotonic platforms.

TL;DR: Nonlocality is key in quantum mechanics. The paper introduces a measure for its contribution to extractable work in bipartite systems. For non-interacting Hamiltonians, it links ergotropy and correlations. The nonlocal resource enhances extractable work without interactions, but with interactions, its influence can grow or dwindle based on the system's specifics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum thermodynamics aims to understand how quantum resources like nonlocality enable useful work. This paper fills a gap by quantifying nonlocality’s role in extractable work for bipartite systems.

Method: The authors develop a quantifier based on Schmidt coefficients and use this to derive expressions under different Hamiltonians.

Result: Their analysis shows nonlocality's critical role in extractable work, particularly in non-interacting scenarios, but interactions complicate this relationship.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for optimizing work extraction in quantum systems by understanding nonlocality.

Abstract: Nonlocality is a defining feature of quantum mechanics and has long served as a key indicator of quantum resources since the formulation of Bell's inequalities. Identifying the contribution of nonlocality to extractable work remains a central problem in quantum thermodynamics. We address this by introducing a quantifier of nonlocal contributions to extractable work in bipartite systems. It is shown that closed form expressions can be calculated for our quantity in terms of the Schmidt coefficients. Further for strictly non-interacting Hamiltonian, the direct relationship between ergotropy and correlations is established. Our results reveal that nonlocal resources invariably enhance extractable work under non-interacting Hamiltonians, while in the presence of interactions, their contribution can either increase or diminish depending on the structure of the state and the Hamiltonian.

Abstract: With the latest advances in quantum computing technology, we are gradually moving from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era characterized by hardware limited in the number of qubits and plagued with quantum noise, to the age of quantum utility where both the newest hardware and software methods allow for tackling problems which have been deemed difficult or intractable with conventional classical methods. One of these difficult problems is the simulation of one-dimensional (1D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, a major tool to learn about the structure of molecules, helping the design of new materials or drugs. Using advanced error mitigation and error suppression techniques from Q-CTRL together with the latest commercially available superconducting-qubit quantum computer from IBM and trapped-ion quantum computer from IonQ, we present the quantum Hamiltonian simulation of liquid-state 1D NMR spectra in the high-field regime for spin systems up to 34 spins. Our pipeline has a major impact on the ability to execute deep quantum circuits with the reduction of quantum noise, improving mean square error by a factor of 22. It allows for the execution of deep quantum circuits and obtaining salient features of the 1D NMR spectra for both 16-spin and 22-spin systems, as well as a 34-spin system, which lies beyond the regime where unrestricted full Liouvillespace simulations are practical (32 spins, the Liouville limit). Our work is a step toward near-term quantum utility in NMR spectroscopy.

Abstract: Continuously operating atom-light interfaces represent a key prerequisite for steady-state quantum sensors and efficient quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate continuous accumulation of sub-Doppler-cooled atoms in a shallow intracavity dipole trap, realizing this regime. The key ingredient is a light-shift manipulation that creates spatially varying cooling parameters, enabling efficient capture and accumulation of atoms within a cavity mode. Demonstrated with rubidium atoms, a continuous flux from a source cell is funneled through the magneto-optical trap into the cavity mode, where the atoms are cooled and maintained below $10~μ\text{K}$ in steady state without time-sequenced operation. We characterize the resulting continuously maintained ensemble of millions of atoms and its collective coupling to the cavity field, establishing a route toward continuously operated cavity-QED systems and long-duration atomic and hybrid quantum sensors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cloud quantum platforms give users access to many backends with different qubit technologies, coupling layouts, and noise levels. The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift.

TL;DR: We developed a PINN framework for quantum state tomography that outperforms traditional methods in terms of measurement efficiency and noise resilience, especially as the number of qubits increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum state tomography is crucial for verifying the states of quantum systems, but traditional methods require exponentially increasing measurements and are highly sensitive to noise. This makes them impractical for large-scale quantum systems.

Method: Our approach uses a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that incorporates quantum mechanical constraints through adaptive weighting. The network features a residual-and-attention-enhanced architecture and a differentiable Cholesky parameterization to ensure the validity of the quantum state estimates.

Result: Experiments on systems with 2 to 5 qubits, and arbitrary-dimensional states, showed that our PINN framework consistently outperformed traditional methods. It achieved the highest fidelity across all dimensions and showed superior noise robustness and dimensional scalability.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that physics-informed neural networks can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of quantum state tomography, making scalability and noise resilience feasible for practical applications in quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) faces exponential measurement requirements and noise sensitivity in multi-qubit systems, bottlenecking practical quantum technologies. We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework integrating quantum mechanical constraints via adaptive weighting, a residual-and-attention-enhanced architecture, and differentiable Cholesky parameterization for physical validity. Evaluations on 2--5 qubit systems and arbitrary-dimensional states show PINN consistently outperforms traditional neural networks (TNNs), achieving highest fidelity across all dimensions. PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness. Theoretical analysis shows physical constraints reduce Rademacher complexity and mitigate the curse of dimensionality via constraint-induced dimension and sample complexity reduction, effective regardless of qubit number. While experiments are limited to 5-qubit systems due to computational constraints, our theoretical framework (convergence guarantees, generalization bounds, scalability theorems) justifies PINN's advantages will persist and strengthen in larger systems (6+ qubits), where constraint-induced dimension reduction benefits grow with system size. Practically, this advances quantum error correction and gate calibration by reducing measurement requirements from O(4^n) to O(2^n) while maintaining high fidelity, enabling faster error correction cycles and accelerated calibration critical for scalable quantum computing.

Abstract: We study the fair sampling properties of hybrid quantum-classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states. While quantum optimization heuristics such as quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are known to induce biased sampling, hybrid quantum-classical MCMC incorporates quantum dynamics only as a proposal transition and enforces detailed balance through classical acceptance steps. Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling. We also examine solution counting and find that the required number of transitions is comparable to that of WalkSAT. These results indicate that hybrid quantum-classical MCMC provides a viable framework for fair sampling and solution enumeration.

Abstract: The structure and quantification of entanglement in the W-class states are investigated under physically motivated transformations that induce mixed-state dynamics. A rigorous condition is established linking global separability to the behavior of pairwise entanglement, showing that the absence of pairwise entanglement is sufficient to guarantee complete separability of the system, provided the Hilbert-space basis is preserved. This result motivates the identification of the sum of two-tangles as a natural and effective entanglement quantifier for the W-class states. Furthermore, the commonly used $π$-tangle becomes ineffective for the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state as the system size increases, vanishing in the large-$n$ limit. To address this limitation, the sum of $π$-tangles is introduced, which, like the sum of two-tangles, successfully quantifies the entanglement of the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state in the large-$n$ limit. In addition, a new condition for entanglement measures is introduced, which facilitates the formulation of a well-behaved and physically meaningful entanglement measure.

### [164] [Exploiting Reset Operations in Cloud-based Quantum Computers to Run Quantum Circuits for Free](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14582)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper reveals attacks on quantum computing companies that exploit reset operations to free-run quantum circuits, potentially reducing costs by 900%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses concerns about the economic impacts of quantum computing, particularly the pricing models used by cloud-based quantum computing services.

Method: The research demonstrates that by using mid-circuit qubit measurements and resets, users can execute multiple circuits within a single shot, effectively reducing the cost per circuit.

Result: The findings suggest that users can exploit these features to execute multiple circuits within a single shot, significantly reducing the cost per circuit.

Conclusion: Attackers can abuse reset operations to run quantum circuits for free, negatively impacting the financial models of quantum computing companies.

Abstract: This work presents the first thorough exploration of how reset operations in cloud-based quantum computers could be exploited to run quantum circuits for free. This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations.

Abstract: Quantum information processing and computation requires high accuracy qubit configuration readout. In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes.

TL;DR: The paper discusses adaptive sequences of quantum instruments (ASI) and their implementation in quantum circuits. It shows that fewer ancillary qubits are needed than previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the resource requirements for implementing quantum circuits with adaptive measurements is crucial for optimizing quantum hardware and algorithms.

Method: The authors use mathematical proofs and analysis to derive the lower bounds on the product of the number of steps and ancillary qubits.

Result: The paper reveals that quantum instruments increasing the number of qubits can be implemented with fewer ancillary qubits than expected.

Conclusion: This finding challenges common assumptions about the resource costs of adaptive quantum measurements and provides new insights into efficient circuit design.

Abstract: In adaptive quantum circuits classical results of mid-circuit measurements determine the upcoming gates. This allows POVMs, quantum channels or more generally quantum instruments to be implemented sequentially, so that fewer qubits need to be used at each of the $N$ measurement steps. In this paper, we mathematically describe these problems via adaptive sequence of instruments (ASI) and show how any instrument can be decomposed into it. Number of steps $N$ and number of ancillary qubits $n_A$ needed for actual implementation are crucial parameters of any such ASI. We show an achievable lower bound on the product $N.n_A$ and we determine in which situations this tradeoff is likely to be optimal. Contrary to common intuition we show that for quantum instruments which transform $n$ to $m(>n)$ qubits, there exist $N$-step ASI implementing them just with $(m-n)$ ancillary qubits, which are remeasured $(N-1)$ times and finally used as output qubits.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了量子计算在深度3以下的电路下，对一些布尔函数如PARITY和MAJORITY的计算能力有限，尤其是深度2的量子电路无法有效近似高影响布尔函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子计算与经典计算在常数深度下的能力差异，特别是量子计算是否在这些深度下提供超越经典计算的力量。

Method: 通过经典计算模拟特定量子电路的技术，扩展了对某些布尔函数下限的证明。

Result: 深度3的QAC^0电路无法计算PARITY，且需至少Ω(√n)次方的门数来计算MAJORITY；深度2的QAC^0电路无法以一定优势近似高影响布尔函数如PARITY。

Conclusion: 常数深度下，量子计算的能力与经典计算在某些布尔函数上并不超越，尤其是在考虑更弱的输出要求后，对经典计算的模拟增强了下界的结果。

Abstract: In this work, we establish the strongest known lower bounds against QAC$^0$, while allowing its full power of polynomially many ancillae and gates. Our two main results show that:
  (1) Depth 3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY regardless of size, and require at least $Ω(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ many gates to compute MAJORITY.
  (2) Depth 2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions (e.g., PARITY) with non-negligible advantage in depth $2$, regardless of size.
  We present new techniques for simulating certain QAC$^0$ circuits classically in AC$^0$ to obtain our depth $3$ lower bounds. In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit (i.e., no restrictions on input preservation/reversible computation), making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ using exponential size. Our proof techniques further suggest that, for inherently classical decision problems, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY). This complements the depth $2$ exponential size upper bound of Rosenthal (2021) for approximating nekomatas (which is used as a sub-circuit in the only known constant depth PARITY upper bound).

TL;DR: A new pxcLDA functional efficiently describes electron densities in many-electron systems under varying light-matter coupling with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing accurate QEDFT functionals for practical applications is essential for understanding light-matter interactions in quantum systems.

Method: The pxcLDA functional is based on the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and incorporates renormalization factors by comparing with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster and optimized effective potential methods.

Result: pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities of various atoms and molecules with strong agreement, and the renormalization factor tends to unity in the large-system limit, enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: This work provides a computationally efficient QEDFT functional suitable for realistic systems with improved accuracy across different coupling regimes.

Abstract: We present results of a photon-free exchange-correlation functional within the local density approximation (pxcLDA) for quantum electrodynamics density functional theory (QEDFT) that efficiently describes the electron density of many-electron systems across weak to strong light-matter coupling. Building on previous work [I-Te. Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 109, 052823 (2024)] that captured electron-photon correlations via an exchange-correlation functional derived from the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and tested on one-electron systems, we use a simple procedure to compute a renormalization factor describing electron-photon correlations and inhomogeneity in the weak-coupling regime by comparing it with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster, and previous QEDFT optimized effective potential methods. Across various atoms and molecules, pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities in close agreement with these references. The renormalization factor approaches unity as the system size or collective coupling increases, reflecting an electron-photon exchange-dominated behavior and improved accuracy for larger systems. This approach now offers a practical route to applying QEDFT functionals based on electron density to realistic electron systems.
