A defect line in the substrate on which the $\u03b1-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $\u03b1$. The latter tunes the $\u03b1-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($\u03b1=0$) to a dice lattice ($\u03b1=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $\u0394(x) diag(1,\\quad -1,\\quad 1)$, assuming $\u0394(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $\u03b1$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed.

Here, we present an experimentally validated framework that attributes FIB-induced spin-wave steering to magnetoelastic effects arising from irradiation-induced lattice dislocations. Following FIB irradiation and wet-chemical etching, local height profiles were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used as fixed geometric constraints in fits of spin-wave dispersion relations measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (trMOKE) microscopy. The dispersion relation was extended by an explicit magnetoelastic field term, treated as a fit parameter. Its evolution reveals three successive deformation regimes, elastic, plastic, and partial amorphization, explaining the observed non-monotonic dependence of the spin-wave wavelength on ion dose. A three-phase deformation scenario based on SRIM simulations reproduces the extracted magnetoelastic field trends, validating the fitting approach.

In this work, we explore second-harmonic (SH) stabilization, which exploits the interplay of a dispersive mode structure against the strict energy conservation of second-harmonic generation. Operationally, we use two, 1550 nm lasers to PDH-detect octave-spaced resonant modes of an ultra-high-Q photonic resonator with one laser frequency-doubled to 775 nm. Under SH stabilization, the microwave frequency offset between the 1550 nm lasers, which we refer to as the SH signal ($f_{SH}$) maps the absolute frequency of the 1550 nm laser to an electronic signal. We characterize this mapping through comparison of the absolute optical frequency inference provided by $f_{SH}$ to an out-of-loop optical measurement, and our results suggest $f_{SH}$ accurately proxies frequency drift. We evaluate the sensitivity and noise floor of this technique, considering contributions from laser locking and bulk material properties, and conclude that $f_{SH}$ is sufficiently sensitive to enhance long-term laser-frequency stability with respect to the resonator.

By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures.

We compare two physically distinct detector models: detectors whose spatial profile expands with the Universe, and detectors whose proper size remains fixed despite cosmological expansion. We find that the lack of time-reversal symmetry in cosmological settings generically leads to constructive or destructive interference between communication mediated correlations and harvested field correlations, dramatically affecting the entanglement that detectors can acquire. In particular, rapid expansion can suppress entanglement entirely for expanding detectors through destructive interference, even when both communication and field correlations are individually large, whereas detectors that maintain a fixed proper size remain capable of acquiring significant entanglement. Our results show that cosmological expansion qualitatively reshapes the balance between communication and harvesting, and that the detector internal cohesion (whether it expands with the Universe or not) plays a crucial role in determining whether detectors' entanglement can survive in rapidly expanding universes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable.

The approach only involves at worse a quadratic cost in the system size, allowing to simulate up to several thousands of qubits on a classical computer. It provides qualitatively accurate description of one-qubit observables evolutions, making it a useful reference in comparison to techniques limited to small qubit numbers. The predictive power is however less robust for multi-qubits observables. We benchmark the method on the $k$-local transverse-field Ising model (TFIM), considering a large variety of systems ranging from local to all-to-all interactions, and from weak to strong coupling regimes, with up to 2000 qubits.

Unlike classical pupil-plane wavefront sen-sors, the proposed architecture does not include any wavelength-specific optical elements, enabling straightforward adaptation across a broad spectral range. The achievable spatial resolution of the reconstructed wavefront is scalable with the modulator resolution. We experimentally demonstrate wavefront reconstruction at 650 nm and at 2116 nm, where commercial wavefront sensors are not widely available. The reconstructed wavefront is validated against a commercial lateral shearing interferometer at 650 nm, and the method is further integrated into a closed-loop adaptive optics system using a deformable mirror.

Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moir\u00e9 domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moir\u00e9 domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moir\u00e9 domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moir\u00e9 domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\uff08ICO\uff09\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u78c1\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u4e0d\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5728 ICO \u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001 simultaneously \u5b8c\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cf\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5386\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u78c1\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6211\u4e5f\u62e5\u6709\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u987a\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u6574\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Given the dynamics underlying the effect and the storage-release mechanism occurring for finite excitation pulses, studying and understanding the associated time dynamics are crucial for enabling future applications. In this work, we carefully investigate this phenomenon in symmetric and asymmetric geometries, shedding light on practical considerations in situations when a closed-form analytical solution is not readily available. Combinations of time domain analysis and spectral filtering are used to enable systematic analysis of these structures. Our approach can be generalized to more complex structures, including multilayered and inhomogeneous cases, providing new opportunities for optimized energy storage and advanced sensing applications utilizing complex-frequency dynamics in lossless designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u96f6\u9891\u7387\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u591a\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u50a8\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u96f6\u9891\u7387\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u50a8\u80fd\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u6ee4\u6ce2\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u96f6\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u590d\u6742\u591a\u5c42\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u96f6\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u91ca\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u96f6\u9891\u7387\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B < 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $\u0394_\\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u573a\u78c1\u573a\u8fd0\u8f93\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86GaAs\u4e8c\u7ef4 hole \u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d\u91cd Hole \u5206\u6563\u6027", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u91cf\u8868\u91cd Hole \u5206\u6563\u6027\u5bf9 spin-orbit \u6469\u64e6\u7684\u8d21\u732e", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u573a\u78c1\u573a\u8fd0\u8f93( B < 1 T )\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790 Shubnikov-de Haas \u632f\u8361\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7 Luttinger \u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570-free \u8ba1\u7b97", "result": "HH- \u5206\u6563\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u578b\uff0cHH+ \u975e\u629b\u7269\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u91cd Hole \u5206\u6563\u6027\u968f\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u91cd Hole \u5206\u6563\u6027\u968f\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u91cf\u8868\u4e86\u5176\u503c\u4e3a\u7ea6 36%\u3002"}}

Using a triangular lattice of three $^{171}$Yb$^{+}$ ions, we optically pump selected ions into the long-lived $^2F_{7/2}$ state. We then apply a global Ising-like Hamiltonian to the system and verify that the shelved qubits are fully removed from participation in the quantum dynamics.

Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible.

We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances.

Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM \"kite\" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., \"teardrop\"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer.

We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekul\u00e9 distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekul\u00e9 distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors.

There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\u0398((\\varepsilon \u03b2)^{-2})$, where $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\u03b2$ is the accuracy tolerance.

This paper argues that neither of these views is correct, and that the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave is best understood as a collection of latent variables in the sense of a hidden Markov model, a construct that was not available when de Broglie and Bohm originally formulated what became their pilot-wave theory. This paper also discusses several other challenges for the ontological view of the pilot wave. One such challenge is due to Foldy-Wouthuysen gauge transformations, which connect up with the Deotto-Ghirardi ambiguity in the de Broglie-Bohm theory.

We show that the spectrum exhibits two distinct types of modes, depending on their behavior as the field mass $\u03bc$ increases. In one class, the real oscillation frequency decreases and eventually approaches zero, while in the other the damping rate tends to vanish. When either the real or imaginary part of the frequency reaches zero, the corresponding mode disappears from the spectrum, and the first overtone replaces it.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u655b\u7684\u62c9\u74e6ier\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Casadio--Fabbri--Mazzacurati\u5f26\u819c\u9ed1\u8272\u6d1e\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u91cdmass\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u8c31\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u03bc\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e00\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u632f\u52a8\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u51cf\u5c0f\u5e76\u8d8b\u5411\u96f6\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u7c7b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8017\u6563\u7387\u8d8b\u5411\u96f6\u3002\u5f53\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u6216\u865a\u90e8\u8fbe\u5230\u96f6\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u8c31\u4e2d\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u53d6\u4ee3\u5b83\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cdmass\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5728\u819c\u72b6\u9ed1\u6d1e\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6df1\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u7684\u62c9\u74e6\u5c14\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u03bc\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be5\u8c31\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53\u03bc\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u9891\u7387\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u3002\u5f53\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u90e8\u6216\u865a\u90e8\u8fbe\u5230\u96f6\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ece\u8c31\u4e2d\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u53d6\u4ee3\u5b83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728Casadio--Fabbri--Mazzacurati\u819c\u72b6\u9ed1\u6d1e\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cdmass\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u51c6\u6b63\u5219\u6a21\u5f0f\u8c31\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u03bc\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u819c\u72b6\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The effective Hamiltonian for microwave-optical (MO) squeezing is formulated via strong interactions in the microwave-intermediary-optical hybrid system, and based on which rigorous solutions for the dynamics of MO entanglement and quantum steering are derived analytically. Remarkably, it is found that stable MO quantum resources can survive in the unsteady evolution beyond the steady one, and the unsteady evolution can exhibit the enhanced quality over the limit of quantum resources in the steady-state case. Furthermore, the stable MO entanglement as well as one-way and two-way quantum steerings are efficiently controllable by modulating the effective coupling strength. The validity of our theory is demonstrated by applying it to the typical models of electro-optomechanical and cavity optomagnomechanical hybrid systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u5149\u5b50\u4e0e\u5fae\u6ce2\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5149\u5b50-\u5fae\u6ce2\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548coxygcn\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7a33\u6001\u540e\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8026\u5408\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this work we provide an explicit quantum circuit for block encoding a sparse matrix with a periodic diagonal structure. The proposed methodology is based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) framework and on an efficient unitary operator used to project the complex exponential at a frequency $\u03c9$ multiplied by the computational basis into its real and imaginary components.

A recently-proposed protocol, encrypted cloning, showed, however, that the creation of perfect clones is theoretically possible - if the clones are simultaneously encrypted with a single-use decryption key. It has remained an open question, however, whether encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise and thus practical as a quantum primitive. This is nontrivial because spreading quantum information widely could dilute it until barely exceeding the noise level, leading to catastrophic fidelity decay. Given the complexity of hardware noise, theory and classical simulation are insufficient to settle this. Here, we settle this question experimentally, on IBM Heron-R2 superconducting processors using up to 154 qubits. We find that encrypted cloning is stable under hardware noise, even when used as a module, namely in parallel, series or interleaved, while preserving pre-existing entanglement. This establishes it as a versatile quantum primitive for practical use, and it necessitates a refinement to our understanding of the no-cloning theorem: quantum information can be spread at will, in theory and in practice, without dilution or degradation, if encrypted or obscured. The actual constraint is that the decryption mechanism must be single-use.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We instead adopt a stopping-time viewpoint: in minimal-feedback learning, the learning completion can be defined by an online run-length certificate extracted from a one-bit-per-copy record. As an instantiation, we analyze single-shot measurement learning (SSML), introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 98, 052302 (2018)] and [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 170504 (2021)], which tunes a unitary and halts after $M_H$ consecutive successes. Viewing the halting as a sequential certification linking the observed counter to infidelity, we derive sample-complexity bounds that separate search (driving success probability toward unity) from certification (run statistics of consecutive successes). The resulting trade-off among $M_H$, dimension $d$, and one-bit reliability clarifies when performance is control-limited versus certificate-limited. With label-flip noise probability $q$, we find a sharp feasibility threshold: once $qM_H \\gtrsim 1$, the expected halting time grows exponentially, making the learning completion impractical even under ideal control. More broadly, this shows that under severely constrained feedback, the certification can dominate sample complexity and small label noise becomes the information bottleneck. Finally, the near-optimal accuracy enabled by run-length certification aligns with the quantum-state-estimation (and equivalently, no-cloning) limits, expressed in the stopping-time terms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u529f\u6b21\u6570\u505c\u6b62\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u505c\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u800c\u8a00\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u957f\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f18\u505c\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Using first-principles density-functional theory, we quantify its response to isotropic strain spanning strong compression and tensile regimes (effective hydrostatic pressures of approximately $-80$ to $180$~GPa). The coexistence of doubly degenerate $e_g$ and $e_u$ levels produces a structural instability captured by a quadratic product Jahn--Teller model. Under isotropic compression, the zero-phonon line blue-shifts nearly linearly while the $E_g$ phonon stiffens, suppressing vibronic instabilities and reducing Jahn--Teller quenching. Consequently, the Ham-reduced excited-state spin--orbit splitting increases substantially and the dark--bright vibronic gap widens. In contrast, isotropic tensile strain enhances vibronic effects and induces symmetry breaking beyond a critical strain, with tunneling-mediated dynamical averaging at the onset. Throughout the symmetry-preserving regime, parity remains well defined, so isotropic strain alone does not activate the dark transition. Charge-transition levels indicate photostability of the emission deep into the compressive regime, and near the highest photostable deformation ($\\sim 100$~GPa), the radiative lifetime increases due to a reduced transition dipole moment despite the increasing optical energy.

We do this by explicitly creating a GRAPE pulse with fixed 'active' evolution times using single spin-1/2 methods, and pulsing on one spin at a time. By enforcing this form uniformly across offsets ('band-schematic' pulses),chemical shift and scalar coupling evolution of the entire system can be precisely controlled. We demonstrate the approach by constructing band-schematic pulses and a continuously irradiated joint INEPT (JINEPT) that achieves band-selective transfer $I_z \\rightarrow 2I_zS_z$.

Here, we improve it by introducing a Pareto Archive and dominated solutions substitution, clearly improving in hyper-volume convergence at additional quantum and classical cost. We propose the use of RMNK-landscapes as a unifying testbed for benchmarking QMOO, as it is common in classical multi-objective field. By devising a generic classical-to-quantum mapping of these landscapes, we perform a numerical hyperparameter tuning of QMOO, significantly enhancing its performance. Finally, we compare QMOO against well-known classical solvers for multi-objective tasks, NSGA-II/III, showing comparable results in small instances. Our results demonstrate that QMOO, when carefully tuned for the task at hand, might be advantageous on harder problems than its classical counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5QMOO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Pareto\u5b58\u6863\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f15\u5165RMNK-\u5730\u5f62\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u8f6c\u6362\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7528QMOO\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178NSGA-II/III\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cQMOO\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7126\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5QMOO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Pareto\u5b58\u6863\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06RMNK-\u5730\u5f62\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684QMOO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178NSGA-II/III\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u66f4\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u503c\u5f97\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

This challenge has been addressed through device-focused approaches that aim to increase nonlinear interactions relative to decoherence rates. In this work, we adopt a complementary architecture-focused approach by proposing a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that minimizes the duration of quantum information processing tasks, thereby reducing the requirements on nonlinear interaction rates. The RQPN consists of a network of all-to-all connected nonlinear cavities with dynamically controlled waveguide couplings, and it processes information by capturing a photonic input state, recirculating photons between the cavities, and releasing a photonic output state. We demonstrate the RQPN's architectural advantage through two examples: first, we show that processing all qubits simultaneously yields faster operations than single- and two-qubit decompositions of the three-qubit Toffoli gate. Second, we demonstrate implementations of a measurement-free correction for single-photon loss, achieving up to seven-fold speedups and significantly improved hardware efficiency relative to state-of-the-art architecture proposals. Our work shows that a single hardware-efficient recirculating architecture substantially reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates and quantum error correction, thereby lowering the barrier to experimental realizations of deterministic photonic quantum information processing.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a recirculating quantum photonic network (RQPN) that significantly reduces the temporal overhead of multi-qubit gates, enabling deterministic photonic quantum information processing with reduced requirements on nonlinear interaction rates.", "motivation": "Deterministic quantum information processing using photons presents challenges due to decoherence and loss.

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates the trainability and potential quantum advantage of IQP-QCBMs by deriving analytic expressions for loss gradient variances and demonstrating how initialization parameters affect their ability to scale polynomially and avoid exponentially vanishing gradients.

In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6240\u8c13\u201c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u4ea4\u70b9\u201d\uff08EMC\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4ea4\u70b9\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u7535\u6c60\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u8017\u6563\u566a\u58f0\u540e\uff0cEMC\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u7535\u6c60\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u5904EMC\uff0c\u800c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u53ea\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u5904\u3002\u6700\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0cEMC\u5fc5\u7136\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u4f53\u7cfb\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fdd\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u4ea4\u70b9\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bEMC\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u521d\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5728\u53d7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fdd\u7f57\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0cEMC\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u521d\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u53ca\u80fd\u91cf\u5171\u540c\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u548c\u4e09\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u6001\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u6001\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4\u53ca\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u5206\u6790EMC\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "1. \u521d\u6001\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u7535\u6c60\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u6001\u5b58\u5728EMC\u30022. \u5728\u53d7\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fdd\u7f57\u566a\u58f0\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u521d\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9aEMC\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u5426\u30023. \u5728\u591a\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u5904EMC\uff0c\u800c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u73af\u5883\u53ea\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u5904\u30024. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0cEMC\u5fc5\u7136\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5219\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e8c\u80fd\u7ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cEMC\u5fc5\u7136\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u9a6c\u59c6\u5df4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ea7\u4f53\u7cfb\u5219\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u6c60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Temporal fluctuations of energy relaxation in these qubits are widely attributed to microscopic two-level systems (TLSs) in device dielectrics and interfaces, yet isolating individual defects typically relies on tuning the qubit or the TLS into resonance. We demonstrate a novel spectroscopy method for fixed-frequency transmons based on multilevel relaxation: repeated preparation of the second excited state and simultaneous $T_1$ extraction of the first and second excited states reveals characteristic correlations in the decay rates of adjacent transitions. From these correlations we identify one or more dominant TLSs and reconstruct their frequency drift over time. Remarkably, we find that TLSs detuned by $\\gtrsim 100\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ from the qubit transition can still significantly influence relaxation. The proposed method provides a powerful tool for TLS spectroscopy without the need to tune the transmon frequency, either via a flux-tunable inductor or AC-Stark shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u7684Transmon qubit\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u80fd\u7ea7\u5f1b\u8c6b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574Transmon\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u591a\u6b21\u5236\u5907\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u7b2c\u4e00\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684T1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u5f15\u8d77\u7684TLS\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5bf9Transmon qubit\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574qubit\u9891\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u7684Transmon qubit\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u9891\u573a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u7684Transmon qubit\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u5236\u5907\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u7b2c\u4e00\u548c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7684T1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u90bb\u80fd\u7ea7\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u7684TLS\u53ca\u5176\u9891\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7fTLS\u88ab\u4e25\u91cd\u9884\u5148\u8c03\u8c10\uff08\u504f\u5dee\u8fbe100MHz\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u4ecd\u4f1a\u5bf9Relaxation\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574Transmon\u9891\u7387\u7684TLS\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684TLS\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574Transmon\u9891\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u6790TLS\u5bf9\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u4e24\u7ec4\u5206\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u73bb\u8272-\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u51dd\u805a\u4f53\u5728\u53ef\u6df7\u5408\u76f8 regime\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u6709\u5e8f\u78c1\u6027\u76f8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Bo seemed\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u8c31\u548c\u76f8\u5e72\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u58f0\u901f\u3001\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u76f8\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65e0\u5168\u5c40\u78c1\u5316\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f4e\u80fd excitation\u7684\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u58f0\u901f\u3001\u78c1\u5316\u7387\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u540e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86Lee-Huang-Yang\u4fee\u6b63\u5bf9\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ea4\u9519\u78c1\u76f8\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u78c1\u6027\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u76f8\u53d8\u548c\u6709\u5e8f\u78c1\u6027\u76f8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u76f8\u53d8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}
