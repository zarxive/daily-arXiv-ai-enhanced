### [1] [Velocity effects slightly mitigating the quantumness degradation of an Unruh-DeWitt detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01280)
*P. H. M. Barros,Shu-Min Wu,C. A. S. Almeida,H. A. S. Costa*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR:  studied velocity effects on information degradation in accelerated quantum systems under Unruh effect, found that non-relativistic motion reduced degradation, while ultra-relativistic motion suppressed degradation. Implications for quantum information preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  understanding the role of velocity in quantum information preservation under Unruh effect, potentially relevant for quantum communication and computing.

Method:  the study involved theoretical analysis of quantum systems under acceleration, including qubits, interferometric circuits and which-path distinguishability. Analytical expressions for transition rates, coherence, visibility and distinguishability were derived for non-relativistic velocities. For ultra-relativistic regimes, suppression of Unruh effect was observed via numerical simulations.

Result:  information degradation due to Unruh effect decreases with non-relativistic motion, but for ultra-relativistic velocities, the effect is suppressed. The results suggest that careful control of velocity regimes can help mitigate information loss in highly accelerated quantum systems, though the effects are small.

Conclusion:  The findings demonstrate that non-relativistic, transverse, constant acceleration can act as a protective mechanism for quantum systems against information loss via the Unruh effect. However, such effects are minor, showing the need for further research into alternative methods to enhance quantum system stability under high acceleration.



Abstract: In this work, we investigate the velocity effects on information degradation
due to the Unruh effect in accelerated quantum systems (with finite interaction
time). We consider a detector moving along a spatial trajectory within a
two-dimensional plane. The quantum systems studied were: accelerated
single-qubit, quantum interferometric circuit, and which-path
distinguishability circuit. Thus, for non-relativistic velocity regime, we
obtained analytical expressions such as transition rates, quantum coherence,
visibility, distinguishability, and the complementarity relation. On the other
hand, for the ultra-relativistic velocity regime, we saw that the Unruh effect
is suppressed and therefore the detector does not respond in this case. Our
findings revealed that velocity effects imply mitigation of information
degradation, this interesting behaviors happen because of the composite effect
of both velocity and acceleration. The results obtained show that the addition
of the non-relativistic, transverse and constant motion of an accelerated
detector can play a protective role in quantumness in systems at high
accelerations, although the effects are very small.

### [2] [Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01306)
*Souvik Bandyopadhyay,Anushya Chandran,Philip JD Crowley*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses a cavity-QED architecture for designing quantum computer components, including methods to prepare and segregate quantum states using photonic cavity states, topological protection, and Floquet engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in quantum computing rely heavily on the development of reliable and scalable quantum state manipulation techniques.

Method: The authors propose a system of three interconnected cavities coupled to a qubit, employing a topologically protected mechanism for quantum state circulation using chiral boundary states.

Result: The quantum states circulate through the cavities with a specific period and remain robust even in the semi-classical approximation, even for large photon numbers.

Conclusion: This architecture represents a promising platform for building the necessary quantum computer components using superconducting qubits.

Abstract: Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum
state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a
quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose
a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in
which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons
circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and
back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral
boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to
perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit,
demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total
photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired
Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test
these devices in the near term.

### [3] [Robust Rydberg facilitation via rapid adiabatic passage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01504)
*Xinghan Wang,Yupeng Wang,Qi-Yu Liang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A new method for Rydberg antiblockade based on rapid adiabatic passage is introduced, which is robust against disorder and parameter variations. It can lead to avalanche excitation in arrays and has potential for rare-event detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rydberg antiblockade is crucial for quantum information processing and sensing, but its sensitivity to disorder and parameter variations has hindered practical applications. This paper addresses these limitations.

Method: The method involves adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, which reduces sensitivity to disorder and parameter variations.

Result: The approach shows robust dynamics, leading to high excitation and low background, making it suitable for rare-event detection.

Conclusion: This method provides a practical route to implement robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, opening up new experimental possibilities.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust implementation of Rydberg antiblockade based
on rapid adiabatic passage. Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key
opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to
position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By
adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach
is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a
straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to
avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This
avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it
promising for rare-event detection. These results establish a practical route
to robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, paving the way for future experimental
and technological applications.

### [4] [Non-stabilizerness in quantum-enhanced metrological protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01380)

Result: 量子的信息量与对新对称群的违反能力有关。研究通过可逆变换影响信息容量，提供了一个量化新对称群能力的方法。

Conclusion: 量子态的信息容量由其对new symmetry group的违反能力决定，而无需计算复杂度。此发现为研究各种量子态提供了简单途径，这对于设计和量化新的量子操作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness (colloquially "magic") characterizes genuinely quantum
(beyond-Clifford) operations necessary for preparation of quantum states, and
can be measured by stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). For permutationally
symmetric states, we show that the SRE depends, for sufficiently large systems,
only on a constant number of expectation values of collective spin operators.
This compact description is leveraged for analysis of spin-squeezing protocols,
which inherently generate non-stabilizerness. Under one-axis twisting (OAT),
the generation of optimal squeezing is accompanied by a logarithmic divergence
of SRE with system system size. Continued time evolution under OAT produces
metrologically useful "kitten" states-superpositions of rotated GHZ states-that
feature many-body Bell correlations but exhibit a smaller,
system-size-independent SRE that decreases with increasing Bell-correlation
strength. Our results reveal connections between non-stabilizerness,
multipartite correlations, and quantum metrology, and provide a practical route
to quantify non-stabilizerness in experiments for precision sensing.

Conclusion: QUBO问题模型在处理高维优化问题时表现出显著优势，为格点蛋白构象研究提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Steric clashes pose a challenge when exploring dense protein systems using
conventional explicit-chain methods. A minimal example is a single lattice
protein confined on a minimal grid, with no free sites. Finding its minimum
energy is a hard optimization problem, withsimilarities to scheduling problems.
It can be recast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
problem amenable to classical and quantum approaches. We show that this problem
in its QUBO form can be swiftly and consistently solved for chain length 48,
using either classical simulated annealing or hybrid quantum-classical
annealing on a D-Wave system. In fact, the latter computations required about
10 seconds. We also test linear and quadratic programming methods, which work
well for a lattice gas but struggle with chain constraints. All methods are
benchmarked against exact results obtained from exhaustive structure
enumeration, at a high computational cost.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A quantum error correcting code protects encoded logical information against
errors. Transversal gates are a naturally fault-tolerant way to manipulate
logical qubits but cannot be universal themselves. Protocols such as magic
state distillation are needed to achieve universality via measurements and
postselection. A phase is a region of parameter space with smoothly varying
large-scale statistical properties except at its boundaries. Here, we find a
phase of continuously tunable logical unitaries for the surface code
implemented by transversal operations and decoding that is robust against
dephasing errors. The logical unitaries in this phase have an infidelity that
is exponentially suppressed in the code distance compared to their rotation
angles. We exploit this to design a simple fault-tolerant protocol for
continuous-angle logical rotations. This lowers the overhead for applications
requiring many small-angle rotations such as quantum simulation.

Abstract: In classical mechanics, driven systems with dissipation often exhibit
complex, fractal dynamics known as strange attractors. This paper addresses the
fundamental question of how such structures manifest in the quantum realm. We
investigate the quantum Duffing oscillator, a paradigmatic chaotic system,
using the Caldirola-Kanai (CK) framework, where dissipation is integrated
directly into a time-dependent Hamiltonian. By employing the Husimi
distribution to represent the quantum state in phase space, we present the
first visualization of a quantum strange attractor within this model. Our
simulations demonstrate how an initially simple Gaussian wave packet is
stretched, folded, and sculpted by the interplay of chaotic dynamics and energy
loss, causing it to localize onto a structure that beautifully mirrors the
classical attractor. This quantum "photograph" is inherently smoothed, blurring
the infinitely fine fractal details of its classical counterpart as a direct
consequence of the uncertainty principle. We supplement this analysis by
examining the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), which shows that stronger
dissipation clarifies the exponential growth associated with the classical
Lyapunov exponent, thereby confirming the model's semiclassical behavior. This
work offers a compelling geometric perspective on open chaotic quantum systems
and sheds new light on the quantum-classical transition.

### [8] [Temporal Pulse Origins in Atom Interferometric Quantum Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01900)
*Jack Saywell,Nikolaos Dedes,Max Carey,Brynle Barrett,Tim Freegarde*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper discusses a method to improve the performance of atom interferometry-based quantum sensors by exploring the concept of a temporal pulse origin. The authors propose that by parameterizing the inertial phase response of radio-frequency or optical pulses using a single point in time, they can determine and stabilize the measurement scale factor more effectively. They demonstrate that using this approach can reduce the duration of quantum sensor sequences and enhance their robustness to fluctuations in control field amplitude, leading to better performance in both classical and next-generation interferometric quantum sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research aims to advance the field of quantum sensors by addressing limitations in their measurement capabilities and stability, proposing an innovative method using temporal pulse origin to improve their functionality.

Method: The authors propose a method involving the parameterization of the inertial phase response of radio-frequency or optical pulses using a single point in time, referred to as the temporal pulse origin. They conduct simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in reducing overall sequence durations and increasing robustness to realistic fluctuations in control field amplitude.

Result: The results show that incorporating temporal pulse origin design can lead to shorter sequence durations, higher stability against environmental perturbations, and reduced systematic errors, which benefits current and next-generation quantum sensors.

Conclusion: By introducing the temporal pulse origin concept, the study provides a novel solution to enhance the performance of atom interferometry-based quantum sensors, offering a promising direction for future advancements in this field.

Abstract: Quantum sensors based upon atom interferometry typically rely on
radio-frequency or optical pulses to coherently manipulate atomic states and
make precise measurements of inertial and gravitational effects. An advantage
of these sensors over their classical counterparts is often said to be that
their measurement scale factor is precisely known and highly stable. However,
in practice the finite pulse duration makes the sensor scale factor dependent
upon the pulse shape and sensitive to variations in control field intensity,
frequency, and atomic velocity. Here, we explore the concept of a temporal
pulse origin in atom interferometry, where the inertial phase response of any
pulse can be parameterized using a single point in time. We show that the
temporal origin permits a simple determination of the measurement scale factor
and its stability against environmental perturbations. Moreover, the temporal
origin can be treated as a tunable parameter in the design of tailored
sequences of shaped pulses to enhance scale factor stability and minimize
systematic errors. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach to
pulse design can reduce overall sequence durations while increasing robustness
to realistic fluctuations in control field amplitude. Our results show that the
temporal pulse origin explains a broad class of systematic errors in existing
devices and enables the design of short, robust pulses which we expect will
improve the performance of current and next-generation interferometric quantum
sensors.

Abstract: Competition between short- and long-range interactions underpins many
emergent phenomena in nature. Despite rapid progress in their experimental
control, computational methods capable of accurately simulating open quantum
many-body systems with complex long-ranged interactions at scale remain scarce.
Here, we address this limitation by introducing an efficient and scalable
approach to dissipative quantum lattices in one and two dimensions, combining
matrix product operators and time-dependent variational Monte Carlo. We
showcase the versatility, effectiveness, and unique methodological advantages
of our algorithm by simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady states
of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ lattices with competing algebraically-decaying
interactions for as many as $N=200$ sites, revealing the emergence of
spatially-modulated magnetic order far from equilibrium. This approach offers
promising prospects for advancing our understanding of the complex
non-equilibrium properties of a diverse variety of experimentally-realizable
quantum systems with long-ranged interactions, including Rydberg atoms,
ultracold dipolar molecules, and trapped ions.

Abstract: The quantum PCP conjecture asks whether it is QMA-hard to distinguish between
high- and low-energy Hamiltonians even when the gap between "high" and "low"
energy is large (constant). A natural proof strategy is gap amplification:
start from the fact that high- and low-energy Hamiltonians are hard to
distinguish if the gap is small (inverse polynomial) and amplify the
Hamiltonians to increase the energy gap while preserving hardness. Such a gap
amplification procedure is at the heart of Dinur's proof of the classical PCP
theorem. In this work, following Dinur's model, we introduce a new quantum gap
amplification procedure for Hamiltonians which uses random walks on expander
graphs to derandomise (subsample the terms of) the tensor product amplification
of a Hamiltonian. Curiously, our analysis relies on a new technique inspired by
quantum de Finetti theorems, which have previously been used to rule out
certain approaches to the quantum PCP conjecture.

Conclusion: 构建了一个简洁又通用的Rydberg-腔系统模型，为探索量子多体复杂性提供了新的平台。

Abstract: Rydberg-cavity systems are emerging as promising platforms for quantum
simulation and quantum information processing. These hybrid architectures
combine two complementary interaction mechanisms: cavity photons mediate
collective long-range couplings, while Rydberg excitations generate strong
short-range interactions. Together, they offer a setting for engineering
many-body phases characterized by a hierarchy of interactions across widely
different length scales. In this work, we introduce a minimal and scalable
model for such systems. Focusing on the strong Rydberg blockade regime, we
restrict the Hilbert space to the subspace enforced by the blockade, yielding a
kinetically constrained long-range model in one spatial dimension. This
approach both captures the physics of Rydberg-cavity experiments in the regime
of strong Rydberg interactions and provides a conceptually transparent
framework for studying the interplay of long-range and short-range
interactions. At equilibrium, in addition to paramagnetic and N\'eel-ordered
phases, the system supports a blockaded ferromagnetic/superradiant phase,
distinct from the conventional superradiant phase. Out of equilibrium, we
identify long-range quantum many-body scars, which are atypical nonthermal
eigenstates that evade the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and giving
rise to slow entanglement growth. In contrast to the linear-in-time
entanglement growth characteristic of short-range scarred models, these
long-range scars exhibit logarithmic entanglement dynamics. Our results
establish a minimal yet versatile framework for Rydberg-cavity systems, and
provide a stepping stone for future theoretical and experimental studies of
this frontier platform in quantum many-body physics.

Result: 实验结果表明，采用经典混乱递归映射的参数化方法后，QAOA在解决复杂的Maximum Satisfiability问题时，不仅性能提升显著，而且在电路深度和优化迭代次数有限的情况下，同样表现优异。

Conclusion: 总之，通过引入经典混乱递归映射的参数化方法，QAOA的变分参数优化问题得到了显著的改善。这是解决深电路组合优化问题的一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a powerful tool in
solving various combinatorial problems such as Maximum Satisfiability and
Maximum Cut. Hard computational problems, however, require deep circuits that
place high demands on classical variational parameter optimization. Ultimately,
this has necessitated investigations into alternative methods for effective
QAOA parameterizations. Here, we study a parameterization scheme based on
classical chaotic recursive mapping, which enables significant reductions in
the scaling of the variational parameter space. Through numerical
investigations of hard Maximum Satisfiability problems, we demonstrate that the
chaotic mapping can effectively match the performance of standard QAOA when
subject to a limited number of classical optimization iterations and
short-depth circuits. Insight into this behavior is elucidated through the lens
of classical dynamical systems and used to inform hybridized schemes that
leverage both standard and chaotic parameterizations. It is shown that these
hybridized approaches can boost QAOA performance beyond that of the standard
approach alone, especially for deep circuits. Through this study, we provide a
new perspective that introduces a generalized framework for specifying
performant, dynamical-map-based QAOA parameterizations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum capacity gives the fundamental limit of information transmission
through a channel. However, evaluating the quantum capacities of a
continuous-variable bosonic quantum channel, as well as finding an optimal code
to achieve the optimal information transmission rate, is in general
challenging. In this work, we derive the quantum capacity and
entanglement-assisted quantum capacity of the bosonic continuous-variable
erasure channel when subject to energy constraints. We then construct random
codes based on scrambling information within the typical subspace of the
encoding state and prove that these codes are asymptotically optimal up to a
constant gap. Finally, using our random coding scheme we design a bosonic
variation of the Hayden-Preskill protocol and find that information recovery
depends on the ratio between the input and output modes. This is in contrast
with the conventional discrete-variable scenario which requires only a fixed
number of additional output qudits.

TL;DR: QOR is a symmetric-encryption-based protocol for quantum onion routing using class group actions and isogeny graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish secure quantum communication by enabling layered encryption similar to classical onion routing while addressing quantum computational challenges.

Method: Uses symmetric encryption with a novel key exchange mechanism between sender and receiver; quantum resources are leveraged for class group actions and isogeny graphs, incorporating Bose-Mesner algebra for commutativity and implementing via CTQWs.

Result: The scheme aggregates abstraction criteria for onion routing security, quantum resistance, and isomorphism-based implementation, though concrete efficiency metrics are omitted.

Conclusion: Ideal for scenarios needing post-quantum security with structured encryption but less suitable for high-speed, scalable networks.

Abstract: Onion routing provides anonymity by layering encryption so that no relay can
link sender to destination. A quantum analogue faces a core obstacle: layered
quantum encryption generally requires symmetric encryption schemes, whereas
classically one would rely on public-key encryption. We propose a
symmetric-encryption-based quantum onion routing (QOR) scheme by instantiating
each layer with the abelian ideal class group action from the Theory of Complex
Multiplication. Session keys are established locally via a Diffie-Hellman key
exchange between neighbors in the chain of communication. Furthermore, we
propose a novel ''non-local'' key exchange between the sender and receiver. The
underlying problem remains hard even for quantum adversaries and underpins the
security of current post-quantum schemes. We connect our construction to
isogeny graphs and their association schemes, using the Bose-Mesner algebra to
formalize commutativity and guide implementation. We give two implementation
paths: (i) a universal quantum oracle evaluating the class group action with
polynomially many quantum resources, and (ii) an intrinsically quantum approach
via continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs), outlined here and developed in a
companion paper. A small Qiskit example illustrates the mechanics (by design,
not the efficiency) of the QOR.

Conclusion: This method offers a robust and efficient way to study the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians without requiring a priori knowledge of the sign structure or a pre-trained phase network.

Abstract: Neural quantum states have emerged as a widely used approach to the numerical
study of the ground states of non-stoquastic Hamiltonians. However, existing
approaches often rely on a priori knowledge of the sign structure or require a
separately pre-trained phase network. We introduce a modified stochastic
reconfiguration method that effectively uses differing imaginary time steps to
evolve the amplitude and phase. Using a larger time step for phase
optimization, this method enables a simultaneous and efficient training of
phase and amplitude neural networks. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated
on the Heisenberg J_1-J_2 model.

Abstract: The Hubbard model has occupied the minds of condensed matter physicists for
most part of the last century. This model provides insight into a range of
phenomena in correlated electron systems. We wish to examine the paradigm of
quantum algorithms for solving such many-body problems. The focus of our
current work is on the one-dimensional model which is integrable, meaning that
there exist analytical results for determining its ground state. In particular,
we demonstrate how to perform a gate-based quantum computer simulation of
quantum annealing for the Hubbard Hamiltonian. We perform simulations for
systems with up to 40 qubits to study the scaling of required annealing time
for obtaining the ground state. We find that for the half-filled cases
considered, there is a substantial quantum speed-up over algorithms based on
the Bethe-ansatz equations.

Abstract: We present the design and characterization of a cryogenic vacuum chamber

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum transport phenomena through generalized initial states and Hamiltonians is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and information processing.

Method: The research employs analytical methods based on solving time-dependent Schrödinger equations with specific initial conditions and Hamiltonians containing complex hopping amplitudes.

Result: The findings include directed quantum transport without bias, a counterintuitive enhancement of short-time spreading followed by reduced long-time spreading, and a precise characterization of survival probability decay.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational framework for controlling quantum transport by tuning initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phases, offering new insights for quantum information and computation.

Abstract: We derive analytical results for continuous-time quantum walks from a new
class of initial states with tunable delocalization. The dynamics are governed
by a Hamiltonian with complex hopping amplitudes. We provide closed-form
equations for key observables, revealing three notable findings: (1) the
emergence of directed quantum transport from completely unbiased initial
conditions; (2) a quantum backfire effect, where greater initial delocalization
enhances short-time spreading but counterintuitively induces a comparatively
smaller long-time spreading after a crossing time $t_{\mathrm{cross}}$; and (3)
an exact characterization of survival probability, showing that the transition
to an enhanced $t^{-3}$ decay is a fine-tuned effect. Our work establishes a
comprehensive framework for controlling quantum transport through the interplay
between intermediate initial delocalization and Hamiltonian phase.

Abstract: We investigate quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe embedded in a
non-Markovian environment, employing the numerically exact hierarchical
equations of motion (HEOM) to overcome the limitations of Born-Markov
approximations. Through a systematic analysis of the dynamical and steady-state
behavior of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR) for temperature
estimation, we identify several key findings that challenge the conventional
expectation that strong coupling necessarily enhances thermometric performance.
In non-equilibrium dynamical thermometry, weak system-environment coupling
generally yields the optimal QSNR, whereas in the steady-state regime, strong
coupling enhances sensitivity only in the ultra-low-temperature limit, while
weak coupling significantly improves precision at moderately low temperatures.
To optimize performance across coupling regimes, we develop a hybrid
computational framework that integrates HEOM with quantum-enhanced particle
swarm optimization, enabling precise quantum dynamical control under varying
coupling strengths. Our results reveal fundamental constraints and
opportunities in quantum thermometry, offering practical strategies for the
design of high-performance quantum thermometers operating in realistic open
quantum systems.

that are specified by a finite number of their higher moments. Using the higher
moments, we find a full spectrum of invariants under Gaussian unitaries,
thereby providing necessary conditions for two states to be related by an
arbitrary (including active, e.g. beyond linear optics) Gaussian unitary.

Abstract: A key technical requirement of any future quantum network is the ability to
distribute quantum-entangled resources between two spatially separated points
at a high rate and high fidelity. Entanglement distribution protocols based on
satellite platforms, which transmit and receive quantum resources directly via
free-space optical propagation, are therefore excellent candidates for quantum
networking, since the geometry and loss characteristics of satellite networks
feasibly allow for up to continental-scale ($\sim10^3$ km) over-the-horizon
communication without the infrastructure, cost, or losses associated with
equivalent fibre-optic networks. In this work, we explore two network
topologies commonly associated with quantum networks - entanglement
distribution between two satellites in low-Earth orbit mediated by a third
satellite and entanglement distribution between two ground stations mediated by
a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and two entanglement distribution schemes - one
where the central satellite is used as a relay, and the other where the central
satellite is used to generate and distribute the entangled resource directly.
We compute a bound on the rate of distribution of distillable entanglement
achieved by each protocol in each network topology as a function of the network
channels for both single-rail discrete- (DV) and continuous-variable (CV)
resources and use or non-use of probabilistic noiseless linear quantum
amplification (NLA). In the case of atmospheric channels we take into account
the turbulent and optical properties of the free-space propagation. We
determine that for the triple-satellite network configuration, the optimal
strategy is to perform a distributed NLA scheme in either CV or DV, and for the
ground-satellite-ground network the optimal strategy is to distribute a DV
resource via the central satellite.

Abstract: We investigate how much quantum distributed algorithms can outperform
classical distributed algorithms with respect to the message complexity (the
overall amount of communication used by the algorithm). Recently, Dufoulon,
Magniez and Pandurangan (PODC 2025) have shown a polynomial quantum advantage
for several tasks such as leader election and agreement. In this paper, we show
an exponential quantum advantage for a fundamental task: routing information
between two specified nodes of a network. We prove that for the family of
``welded trees" introduced in the seminal work by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi,
Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003), there exists a quantum distributed algorithm
that transfers messages from the entrance of the graph to the exit with message
complexity exponentially smaller than any classical algorithm. Our quantum
algorithm is based on the recent "succinct" implementation of quantum walks
over the welded trees by Li, Li and Luo (SODA 2024). Our classical lower bound
is obtained by ``lifting'' the lower bound from Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi,
Gutmann and Spielman (STOC 2003) from query complexity to message complexity.

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the feasibility of simulating quantum many-body systems using a specific method called proximity-based quantum simulation, focusing on the nonequilibrium dynamics of Floquet systems. The authors propose using a disordered heavy-hex lattice setups to test their approach, employing a system size of 60 qubits and utilizing IBM’s Heron r2 quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the limitations of current noisy quantum devices by proposing a method for simulating Quantum many-body systems via proximity-based quantum simulation, which leverages the emerging capabilities of near-term quantum devices.

Method: The authors describe their method, which involves designing a disordered heavy-hex lattice setup with 60 qubits to simulate the dynamics of a disordered kicked Ising model. They utilize the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm_fez and employ the proximity-based quantum simulation method.

Result: The authors successfully observed the many-body localization crossover and successfully validated their results by comparing two independent error mitigation methods, namely, the operator renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.

Conclusion: The authors conclude that their method is a promising approach for simulating future quantum many-body systems in the near-term quantum devices era. Their work provides valuable insights into the simulation of complex quantum systems and paves the way for future research in quantum many-body physics.

Abstract: Simulating nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems is one of the
most promising applications of quantum computers. However, a faithful digital
quantum simulation of the Hamiltonian evolution is very challenging in the
present noisy quantum devices. Instead, nonequilibrium dynamics under the
Floquet evolution realized by the Trotter decomposition of the Hamiltonian
evolution with a large Trotter step size is considered to be a suitable problem
for simulating in the present or near-term quantum devices. In this work, we
propose simulating the many-body localization crossover as such a
nonequilibrium problem in the disordered Floquet many-body systems. As a
demonstration, we simulate the many-body localization crossover in a disordered
kicked Ising model on a heavy-hex lattice using $60$ qubits from $156$ qubits
available in the IBM Heron r2 superconducting qubit device named ibm\_fez. We
compute out-of-time-ordered correlators as an indicator of the many-body
localization crossover. From the late-time behavior of out-of-time-ordered
correlators, we locate the quantum chaotic and many-body localized regimes as a
function of the disorder strength. The validity of the results is confirmed by
comparing two independent error mitigation methods, that is, the operator
renormalization method and zero-noise extrapolation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is vital for fault-tolerant quantum computation, especially for quantum chemistry. This paper evaluates the impact of three key parameters on QPE's quantum resource costs: the choice between Trotterization and Qubitization, the use of molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. The first-quantized qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis is identified as the most efficient, with a gate cost scaling of ~O([N^(4/3)M^(2/3) + N^(8/3)M^(1/3)]/ε). For small molecules, Trotterization in the MO basis offers O(M^7/ε^2) gate cost. The paper also provides numerical estimates of qubit and T gate costs for various molecular systems under different parameter choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computation is transforming chemistry and materials science. Efficient use of quantum resources is crucial for practical applications.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.

Result: The first-quantized qubitization circuit is the most efficient, with detailed scaling laws. For small molecules, the MO basis with Trotterization suffices.

Conclusion: The choice of basis and encoding schemes significantly impacts QPE's efficiency, guiding practical implementations of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry.

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cornerstone algorithm for fault-tolerant
quantum computation, especially for electronic structure calculations of
chemical systems. To accommodate the diverse characteristics of quantum
chemical systems, numerous variants of QPE have been developed, each with
distinct qubit and gate cost implications. In this paper, we quantify the
impact of three key parameters on the overall quantum resource costs for the
QPE algorithm: the choice between trotterization and qubitization, the use of
molecular orbitals versus plane-wave basis-sets, and the selection of the
fermion-to-qubit encoding scheme. From this, we establish clear performance
trade-offs and delineate specific parameter regimes that minimize resource
costs for relevant molecular systems. When performing phase estimation on large
molecules in the fault-tolerant setting, we found the first-quantized
qubitization circuit using the plane-wave basis to be the most efficient, with
a gate cost scaling of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}([N^{4/3}M^{2/3}+N^{8/3}M^{1/3}]/\varepsilon)$ for a system
of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals, which is the best known scaling to date. On
the other hand, when only noisy intermediate-scale or near-term fault-tolerant
systems are available, the phase estimation of small molecules can be performed
with gate cost of $\mathcal{O}(M^{7}/\varepsilon^{2})$ via trotterization in
the MO basis. Furthermore, we provide numerical estimations of qubit and T gate
costs required to perform QPE for several real-world molecular systems under
these different parameter choices.

Abstract: Manifesting across all time, mass and length scales, nonlinearities lie at
the core of numerous physical phenomena. Next-generation quantum applications,
such as quantum sensing, require the combination of nonlinearity with
non-classical correlations. This necessitates the search for an experimental
platform which enables a nonlinear response at ultra-low excitation levels in a
system with practical sensing potential and quantum compatibility. Here, we
report the observation and theoretical modeling of nonlinear dynamics in a
mechanical system driven at the single-excitation level. We achieve this using
a cavity-optomechanical platform with large single-photon coupling rates and a
nonlinear microwave resonator. Specifically, the large Kerr nonlinearity of our
superconducting microwave circuit reduces the threshold for the observation of
nonlinear dynamics by four orders of magnitude, making this regime
experimentally accessible at the few-photon level. The parameter-based
quantitative predicative power of the theoretical description underlines our
deep understanding of the physics involved and that this device concept paves
the way for experiments with non-classical microwave drive schemes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum
information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter
physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization.
One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a
natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth
divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists,
given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to
the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher
information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization
of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I
derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and
geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so
being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives.
Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$,
the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information
matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the
right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting
information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative
values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do
not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$
information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative
entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their
$\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for
estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.

Abstract: We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium
quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm

corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm

annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles

communication technologies. In these applications, highly pure biphoton states
are essential in any time- and frequency-mode, often obviating the need for
time-resolved measurements. Conversely, spectroscopy utilising entangled photon
pairs is gaining significant attention for its ability to unveil molecular
dynamics, a field that critically demands time-resolved capabilities. Here, we
introduce a novel methodology for capturing a biphoton spectrum that comprises
visible and near-infrared photons, resulting in a three-fold non-degenerate
joint spectrum. Our system employs two non-scanning spectrographs: a fibre
spectrograph for near-infrared photons and a delay-line-anode single-photon
imager for visible photons. We successfully measure the joint spectral
intensity by leveraging a time-tagging acquisition strategy. Furthermore, our
approach uniquely enables time-resolved joint spectral measurements with a
temporal resolution of approximately 150 ps. This methodology bridges the gap
between the requirements for pure biphoton states and the need for dynamic
insights in quantum spectroscopy.

Conclusion: 为量子理论中的反事实推理提供了一个有效的框架，弥合了经典与量子理论之间的研究空白。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning plays a crucial role in exploring hypothetical
scenarios, by comparing some consequent under conditions identical except as
results from a differing antecedent. David Lewis' well-known analysis evaluates
counterfactuals using a hierarchy of desiderata. These were, however, built
upon a deterministic classical framework, and whether it could be generalized
to indeterministic quantum theory has been an open question. In this Letter, we
propose a formalism for quantum counterfactuals in which antecedents are
measurement settings. Unlike other approaches, it non-trivially answers
questions like: "Given that my photon-detector, observing an atom's
fluorescence, clicked at a certain time, what would I have seen using a
field-quadrature detector instead?"

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing need for effective analysis of complex, networked data led to the development of this new algorithm.

Method: The algorithm combines quantum and classical dynamics using hybrid Quantum-Classical Walks to explore both local and global connections.

Result: Preliminary results in network community detection show that the hybrid algorithm outperforms existing methods in handling complex graph topologies.

Conclusion: The proposed quantum-inspired approach offers a robust and versatile solution for Graph Representation Learning tasks, particularly in complex network scenarios.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) has emerged as a cornerstone technique
for analysing complex, networked data across diverse domains, including
biological systems, social networks, and data analysis. Traditional GRL methods
often struggle to capture intricate relationships within complex graphs,
particularly those exhibiting non-trivial structural properties such as
power-law distributions or hierarchical structures. This paper introduces a
novel quantum-inspired algorithm for GRL, utilizing hybrid Quantum-Classical
Walks to overcome these limitations. Our approach combines the benefits of both
quantum and classical dynamics, allowing the walker to simultaneously explore
both highly local and far-reaching connections within the graph. Preliminary
results for a case study in network community detection shows that this hybrid
dynamic enables the algorithm to adapt effectively to complex graph topologies,
offering a robust and versatile solution for GRL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The efficiency of adiabatic quantum evolution is governed by the adiabatic
evolution time, \(T\), which depends on the minimum energy gap, \(\Delta\). For
a generic schedule, \(T\) typically scales as \(\Delta^{-2}\), whereas the
rigorous lower bound is \(\mathcal{O}(\Delta^{-1})\). This indicates the
potential for a quadratic speedup through the adiabatic schedule construction.
Here, we introduce the constant speed schedule, which traverses the adiabatic
path of the eigenstate at a uniform rate. We first show that this approach
reduces the scaling of the upper bound of the required evolution time by one
order in \(1/\Delta\). We then provide a segmented constant speed schedule
protocol, in which path segment lengths are computed from eigenstate overlaps
along the adiabatic evolution. By relying on the overlaps on the fly, our
method eliminates the need for prior spectral knowledge. We test our algorithm
numerically on the adiabatic unstructured search, the N$_2$ molecule, and the
[2Fe-2S] cluster. In our numerical experiments, the method achieves the optimal
\(1/\Delta\) scaling in a small gap region, thereby demonstrating a quadratic
speedup over the standard linear schedule.

Result: 两模式高斯态的条件计数测量的成功概率可以解析计算，所需实验尝试次数与检测的光子数呈多项式关系。

Conclusion: 在足够强的压缩条件下，此方法可用于生成高复杂量子光态。

Abstract: Highly non-classical states of light - such as the approximate
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states or cat-like states - can be generated from
experimentally accessible Gaussian states via photon counting measurements on
selected modes, conditioned on specific outcomes of these heralding events. A
simplest yet important example of this approach involves performing photon
number measurements on one mode of a two-mode entangled Gaussian state. The
heralding probability of this scheme is a key figure of merit, as it determines
the generation rate of the targeted non-classical state. In this work we show
that the maximum heralding probability for the two-mode setting can be
calculated analytically, and we investigate its dependence on the number of
detected photons n. Our results show that the number of required experimental
trials scales only polynomially with n. Generation of highly complex optical
quantum states with high stellar rank is thus practically feasible in this
setting, given access to sufficiently strong squeezing.

### [38] [Formal Framework for Quantum Advantage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01953)
*Harry Buhrman,Niklas Galke,Konstantinos Meichanetzidis*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for quantum computational advantage based on individual problem instances, inspired by classical Kolmogorov and instance complexity. It introduces the concept of 'queasy' instances, where quantum algorithms perform significantly better than classical ones. The authors prove the existence of maximally queasy instances for problems like SAT and Factoring, and demonstrate that the 'queasiness' of a quantum algorithm can lead to exponential algorithmic utility. This framework aims to guide the search for quantum advantage in practical applications by focusing on single instances, potentially offering new algorithm design approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is driven by the gap between quantum heuristics and classical worst-case analysis, as well as the potential to identify practical instances where quantum algorithms outperform classical ones.

Method: The method involves defining quantum versions of Kolmogorov complexity and instance complexity, introducing the concept of queasy instances, and using a reduction from Factoring to prove the existence of such instances. The authors also analyze the algorithmic utility of the 'queasiness' of quantum algorithms.

Result: The results show that maximally queasy instances exist for problems like SAT and Factoring, and that the 'queasiness' of quantum algorithms can lead to significant algorithmic benefits. The framework offers a new perspective for designing quantum algorithms by focusing on individual instances.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that focusing on individual problem instances can lead to new ways of designing quantum algorithms. It also suggests that the framework can guide the hunt for quantum advantage in practice, leveraging the unique strengths of quantum computing for specific problem instances.

Abstract: Motivated by notions of quantum heuristics and by average-case rather than
worst-case algorithmic analysis, we define quantum computational advantage in
terms of individual problem instances. Inspired by the classical notions of
Kolmogorov complexity and instance complexity, we define their quantum
versions. This allows us to define queasy instances of computational problems,
like e.g. Satisfiability and Factoring, as those whose quantum instance
complexity is significantly smaller than their classical instance complexity.
These instances indicate quantum advantage: they are easy to solve on a quantum
computer, but classical algorithms struggle (they feel queasy). Via a reduction
from Factoring, we prove the existence of queasy Satisfiability instances;
specifically, these instances are maximally queasy (under reasonable
complexity-theoretic assumptions). Further, we show that there is exponential
algorithmic utility in the queasiness of a quantum algorithm. This formal
framework serves as a beacon that guides the hunt for quantum advantage in
practice, and moreover, because its focus lies on single instances, it can lead
to new ways of designing quantum algorithms.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)-based
framework with the neural quantum embedding (NQE) to predict HIV-1 protease
cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from viral and human proteins. To assess
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework, we compared the
classification performance against classical neural networks under both
noiseless and noisy simulations. Among experimental conditions, the QCNN with
the angle and amplitude encoding NQE conditions consistently outperformed
classical counterparts in both the similar trainable parameter scale and the
different number of qubits (the averaged performance of the 4-qubits and
8-qubits QCNN: 0.9146 and 0.8929 / the averaged performance of the classical
neural network: 0.6125 and 0.8278). The QCNN with the NQE showed stable
performance under the quantum hardware noise, confirming its applicability to
biomedical data analysis with the noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
hardware. This study presents the first application of NQE-augmented QCNNs for
HIV-1 cleavage site classification, providing new insights into scalable and
noise-resilient quantum machine learning for biomedical data.

Abstract: Fiber-integrated nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometers possess high
sensitivity, integration, and flexibility, and thus have been explored
extensively for industrial applications. While most studies have focused on the
optimization of the quantum sensing head, less attention has been paid to the
frequently employed professional, expensive, and bulky electronics, which
hinder their practical applications. In this article, we fabricate a
fiber-integrated NV magnetometer and develop a low-cost microcontroller-based
software lock-in technique. In this technique, a microcontroller coordinates
efficiently a microwave source chip and an analog-to-digital converter, and a
program mimicking the lock-in mechanism realizes microwave frequency-modulated
optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. As a result, with our
setup and technique, we have realized the detection of weak magnetic field with
a sensitivity of 93 nT/Hz^{1/2}, which is comparable to what obtained with
bulky and professional devices. Furthermore, we demonstrated real-time magnetic
field detection, achieving a standard deviation of 488 nT. Our work provides a
novel and cost-effective technique for electronic miniaturization, thereby
potentially accelerating the industrial application of NV magnetometers.

Abstract: Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with
precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by
scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This
highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this
direction is \emph{critical quantum metrology} -- which harnesses the enhanced
susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum
phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial
provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of
prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in
metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided
through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different
critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of
estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss
how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic
open-system and dissipative regimes, and outline both the challenges and
opportunities for future quantum technologies.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过扩展资源理论，为量子信息中的部分信息情况提供了新的理解，并在资源转化和发散度度量上有重要贡献，为未来研究打下了基础。

Abstract: Recent studies have introduced the worst-case quantum divergence as a key
measure in quantum information. Here we show that such divergences can be
understood from the perspective of the resource theory of asymmetric
distinguishability, which utilizes the asymmetric distinguishability between a
pair of quantum states as resource. In our work, we extend this framework to
settings with partial information, where the goal is to distinguish between
sets of quantum states rather than individual states. Within this setting, we
characterize optimal rates for resource distillation and dilution using
(smoothed) one-shot divergences and regularized divergences. Our framework
further exhibits a reversibility property: resource interconversions can be
achieved without loss at rates determined entirely by regularized divergences.
These results offer a broad operational interpretation of divergences between
state sets and generalize existing resource theories to encompass incomplete
information scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了如何通过高斯混合模型有效地解决贝费米子哈密顿量的优化问题，强调了经典相互作用在量子计算中的关键作用。

Abstract: We consider the optimization problem (ground energy search) for fermionic
Hamiltonians with classical interactions. This QMA-hard problem is motivated by
the Coulomb electron-electron interaction being diagonal in the position basis,
a fundamental fact that underpins electronic-structure Hamiltonians in quantum
chemistry and condensed matter. We prove that fermionic Gaussian states achieve
an approximation ratio of at least 1/3 for such Hamiltonians, independent of
sparsity. This shows that classical interactions are sufficient to prevent the
vanishing Gaussian approximation ratio observed in SYK-type models. We also
give efficient semi-definite programming algorithms for Gaussian approximations
to several families of traceless and positive-semidefinite classically
interacting Hamiltonians, with the ability to enforce a fixed particle number.
The technical core of our results is the concept of a Gaussian blend, a
construction for Gaussian states via mixtures of covariance matrices.

### [45] [Realism and the Inequivalence of the Two Quantum Pictures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02138)
*Charles Alexandre Bédard*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum mechanics are equivalent in their empirical predictions but differ in their underlying assumptions. While the Schrödinger picture uses a time-evolving wave function, the Heisenberg picture uses time-evolving descriptors for observables. These descriptors form a non-isomorphic structure that provides a richer explanation for certain quantum phenomena, suggesting a more detailed understanding of reality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental differences between quantum pictures often hinges on their underlying assumptions and the phenomena they account for, especially in complex areas like quantum information theory.

Method: The analysis involves comparing the structural differences between the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures, examining how they account for various quantum phenomena, and assessing the implications of these differences for our understanding of physical reality.

Result: Under a realist framework, the Heisenberg picture's descriptors offer a more refined and separable ontological basis, explaining phenomena like superdense coding more thoroughly than the Schrödinger picture.

Conclusion: This comparison suggests that quantum theory may admit a richer, more detailed ontology when considering the Heisenberg picture's descriptors, potentially enhancing our explanatory capabilities in quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The standard claim that the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures of quantum
mechanics are equivalent rests on the fact that they yield identical empirical
predictions. This equivalence therefore assumes the instrumentalist worldview
in which theories serve only as tools for prediction. Under scientific realism,
by contrast, theories aim to describe reality. Whereas the Schr\"odinger
picture posits a time-evolving wave function, the Heisenberg picture posits
so-called descriptors, time-evolving generators of the algebra of observables.
These two structures are non-isomorphic: descriptors surject onto but do not
reduce to the Schr\"odinger state. Hence, under realism, the pictures are
inequivalent. I argue that this inequivalence marks an opening toward a richer,
separable ontology for quantum theory. On explanatory grounds, descriptors
provide genuinely local accounts of superdense coding, teleportation,
branching, and Bell inequality violations -- phenomena that the Schr\"odinger
framework does not explain fully locally.

Abstract: Convex optimization is the powerhouse behind the theory and practice of
optimization. We introduce a quantum analogue of unconstrained convex
optimization: computing the minimum eigenvalue of a Schr\"odinger operator $h =
-\Delta + V $ with convex potential $V:\mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R_{\ge
0}$ such that $V(x)\rightarrow\infty $ as $\|x\|\rightarrow\infty$. For this
problem, we present an efficient quantum algorithm, called the Fundamental Gap
Algorithm (FGA), that computes the minimum eigenvalue of $h$ up to error
$\epsilon$ in polynomial time in $n$, $1/\epsilon$, and parameters that depend
on $V$. Adiabatic evolution of the ground state is used as a key subroutine,
which we analyze with novel techniques that allow us to focus on the low-energy
space. We apply the FGA to give the first known polynomial-time algorithm for
finding the lowest frequency of an $n$-dimensional convex drum, or
mathematically, the minimum eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian on an
$n$-dimensional region that is defined by $m$ linear constraints in polynomial
time in $n$, $m$, $1/\epsilon$ and the radius $R$ of a ball encompassing the

Abstract: We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial
structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in
contrast to much-studied quantum circuits, and is analytically tractable for
large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit
we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is
diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly
in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we
obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy
density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with
numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a
linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from
level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we
identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor
above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is
effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves
contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many
uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form
factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being
exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural
approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite
coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an
early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively
similar to that in our solvable model.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses reproducible builds in quantum computing, proposing a generalized definition, addressing data confidentiality and computation integrity threats, and providing examples of how classical information can be hidden in quantum circuits, as well as how small circuit modifications can lead to incorrect results. The authors suggest initial steps towards a framework for reproducibility in quantum software toolchains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors are addressing the need for reproducibility in quantum computing, similar to software development practices, but with a focus on both data security and computational integrity. This is particularly important as quantum computing becomes more prevalent, and toolchains may not inherently support reproducible builds.

Method: The paper proposes a generalized definition of reproducible builds for quantum computing and evaluates this through two threat models: one related to data confidentiality during circuit preparation and submission, and another related to the integrity of quantum computation results. Examples are provided to demonstrate how classical information can be embedded in transpiled quantum circuits, and how small changes to these circuits can lead to incorrect computation results.

Result: The main result is the proposal of a generalized definition of reproducible builds for quantum computing, along with examples demonstrating potential vulnerabilities. This could encourage further research into enhancing reproducibility in quantum toolchains and establishing best practices similar to those in traditional software development.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by suggesting that reproducible builds should be adopted in quantum software toolchains, similar to traditional software practices. It outlines initial steps towards creating such a framework and emphasizes the importance of addressing data security and computational integrity in this context.

Abstract: Reproducible builds are a set of software development practices that
establish an independently verifiable path from source code to binary
artifacts, helping to detect and mitigate certain classes of supply chain
attacks. Although quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of research, it
can already benefit from adopting reproducible builds. This paper aims to
bridge the gap between the quantum computing and reproducible builds
communities. We propose a generalization of the definition of reproducible
builds in the quantum setting, motivated by two threat models: one targeting
the confidentiality of end users' data during circuit preparation and
submission to a quantum computer, and another compromising the integrity of
quantum computation results. This work presents three examples that show how
classical information can be hidden in transpiled quantum circuits, and two
cases illustrating how even minimal modifications to these circuits can lead to
incorrect quantum computation results. Our work provides initial steps towards

### [49] [Lower bounds on the complexity of preparing mixed states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02275)
*Max McGinley,Samuel J. Garratt*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种通过量子系统混合态的相互关联性确定 prepare所需深度下限的方法。当两子系统的互信息超过其中一个子系统与环境之间的互信息时，子系统的 past lightcones必须交叠，从而导致 prepare该状态所需的电路深度的下限。该方法应用于量子临界系统，表明当温度降低至某一截止值时，所需深度趋于无限。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望理解混合态的相互关联性如何限制 prepare所需深度。

Method: 研究使用了量子信息论和几何局部单元构造等方法，通过互信息分析子系统的 past lightcones交叠情况，进而推导电路深度的下限。

Result: 得出了一种新的深度下限估算方法，并通过量子临界系统的热态实例验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 研究方法为理解 prepare复杂性片段的潜在结构提供了新的角度。

Abstract: We establish a relationship between the correlations in a many-qubit mixed
state and the minimum circuit depth needed for its preparation. If the mutual
information between two subsystems exceeds the mutual information between one
of those subsystems and the environment, which purifies the mixed state of the
system, then the past lightcones of the subsystems must intersect one another.
This results in a lower bound on the circuit depth of any ensemble of
geometrically local unitaries that prepares the state to some specified degree
of approximation. As an application, we derive lower bounds on the circuit
depth needed to prepare thermal states of one-dimensional quantum critical
systems described by conformal field theory, showing that the depth diverges as
temperature is decreased up to a cutoff set by the preparation error.

Abstract: Tensor network contraction on arbitrary graphs is a fundamental computational
challenge with applications ranging from quantum simulation to error
correction. While belief propagation (BP) provides a powerful approximation
algorithm for this task, its accuracy limitations are poorly understood and
systematic improvements remain elusive. Here, we develop a rigorous theoretical
framework for BP in tensor networks, leveraging insights from statistical
mechanics to devise a \emph{cluster expansion} that systematically improves the
BP approximation. We prove that the cluster expansion converges exponentially
fast if an object called the \emph{loop contribution} decays sufficiently fast
with the loop size, giving a rigorous error bound on BP. We also provide a
simple and efficient algorithm to compute the cluster expansion to arbitrary
order. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the two-dimensional Ising
model, where we find that our method significantly improves upon BP and
existing corrective algorithms such as loop series expansion. Our work opens
the door to a systematic theory of BP for tensor networks and its applications
in decoding classical and quantum error-correcting codes and simulating quantum
systems.

Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for
quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability
of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic
systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close
proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other
excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in
developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the
contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has
been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here,
we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator
consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and
demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the
opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the
hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon
mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by
an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump
phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate
auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating
long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which
may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.

Abstract: The interplay between the fractional quantum Hall effect and nematicity is
intriguing as it links emerging topological order and spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) have indeed been
reported in GaAs quantum wells but only in tilted magnetic fields, where the
in-plane field explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry. Here we report the
observation of FQHSs with highly anisotropic longitudinal resistances in purely
perpendicular magnetic fields at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings
{\nu} = 5/2 and 7/2 in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole systems. The
coexistence of FQHSs and spontaneous symmetry breaking at half fillings signals
the emergence of nematic FQHSs which also likely harbor non-Abelian
quasiparticle excitations. By gate tuning the hole density, we observe a phase
transition from an anisotropic, developing FQHS to an isotropic composite
fermion Fermi sea at {\nu} = 7/2. Our calculations suggest that the mixed
orbital components in the partially occupied LL play a key role in the
competition and interplay between topological and nematic orders.

Abstract: A first-principles understanding of the self-organization of highly regular,
nanometer-scale structures atop irradiated semiconductor surfaces has been
sought for decades. While numerous models exist which explain certain aspects
of this phenomenon, a unified, physical model capable of explaining all details
of pattern formation has remained elusive. However, it is increasingly apparent
that such a model will require understanding the dual influence of the
collision cascade initiated by ion implantation: first, as a source of material
transport by sputtering and atomic displacements occurring over short time
scales, and, second, as a source of defects permitting viscous flow within the
thin, amorphous layer that results from sustained irradiation over longer time
scales. To better understand the latter, we develop several asymptotic
approximations for coupling the localized ion dose with an evolving free
interface. We then show how theoretical predictions of quantities commonly used
for comparison with experimental observations -- such as ripple wavelengths,
critical irradiation angle for patterning onset, and surface roughening --
exhibit surprising sensitivity to the details of this coupling.

Abstract: The electric Hall effect (EHE) is a newly identified Hall effect
characterized by a perpendicular electric field inducing a transverse charge
current in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a spin and valley
version of EHE. We demonstrate that the transverse spin and valley currents can
be generated in an all-in-one tunnel junction based on a buckled 2D hexagonal
material in response to a perpendicular electric field, referred to as the
electric spin Hall effect and electric valley Hall effect, respectively. These
effects arise from the perpendicular-electric-field-induced backreflection
phase of electrons in the junction spacer, independent of Berry curvature. The
valley Hall conductance exhibits an odd response to the perpendicular electric
field, whereas the spin Hall conductance shows an even one. The predicted
effects can further enable the transverse separation of a pair of pure
spin-valley-locked states with full spin-valley polarization while preserving
time-reversal symmetry, as manifested by equal spin and valley Hall angles. Our
findings present a new mechanism for realizing the spin and valley Hall effects
and provide a novel route to the full electric-field manipulation of spin and
valley degrees of freedom, with significant potential for future applications
in spintronics and valleytronics.

Abstract: Recent observations of quantum anomalous Hall effects in moir\'e systems have
revealed the emergence of interaction-driven ferromagnetism with significant
orbital contributions. To capture this physics, we extend the modern theory of
orbital magnetization to Hartree-Fock states and show that the standard
expression remains valid with Hartree-Fock orbitals and Hamiltonians. We then
benchmark our theory against the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in a weak field, which
yields excellent agreement with direct numerical calculations. Applying our
theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers, we find orbital magnetization of order one
Bohr magneton per moir\'e cell with a non-monotonic twist-angle dependence. Our
work establishes a general theory of orbital magnetization in interacting
moir\'e systems and provides quantitative guidance for interpreting recent
experiments.

Abstract: The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many
exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic
system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons
condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This
ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic
scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and
moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be
formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying
voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole
density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For
densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes
individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By
increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi
liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which
indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be
formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new
platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong
correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner
molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform.

Abstract: Non-diffusive effects in charge transport become relevant as device sizes and
features become comparable to the electronic mean free path. As a model system,
we investigate the electric transport around mesoscopic defects in graphene
with scanning tunneling potentiometry. Diffusive and ballistic contributions to
the scattering dipole are probed by simultaneously resolving the nanoscale
topography of pits in the graphene layer and measuring the local
electrochemical potential in the surrounding area. We find evidence of
transport in the intermediate regime between the diffusive and ballistic
limits, such that the magnitude of the electrochemical potential around the
defects is substantially underestimated by diffusive models. Our experiments
and modeling are supported by lattice Boltzmann simulations, which highlight
the importance of the ratio between defect size and mean free path in the
intermediate transport regime. The magnitude of the scattering dipole depends
on the shape of the pits in both the ballistic and diffusive transport modes.
Remarkably, ballistic contributions to the electron transport are found at
feature sizes larger than the mean free path and rapidly increase at lower
sizes, having a noticeable impact already at mesoscopic length scales.

Motivation: Understanding the electronic properties of transition metal dichlorides (TMDs) through their structural and chemical modifications is critical for advancing the field of materials science and nanotechnology.

Method: X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis, and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) were used to characterize the structural and electronic properties of the materials. Theoretical calculations were performed using the Berkeley PWGLetheory (BSE) based on the linearized augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the augmented plane wave and local orbitals (ALGO) linear response method.

Result: Periodic substitution with nitrogen strongly modulates electronic and optoelectronic properties in WSe₂, providing a promising platform for next-generation electron-transporting devices. The optimal conditions for the FETs are identified, which will be instrumental in guiding future device developments.

Conclusion: This work systematically investigates WSe₂ superlattices with nitrogen periodic substitution and provides valuable insights into the electronic and optoelectronic properties, confirming the potential of wurtzite-based TMDs in next-generation devices.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the electronic structures of pristine monolayer
WSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ superlattices with periodic nitrogen substitution. Unlike
random doping, which often introduces in-gap impurity states, periodic nitrogen
doping primarily modulates the band gap, thereby facilitating effective band
gap engineering for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The gap narrows
monotonically with increasing dopant density (pristine $>$ 8-row $>$ 6-row $>$
4-row), directly influencing device switching. We also evaluate the FET
performance of nanojunctions created by these configurations by examining the
contour plot of current density as a function of temperature and gate voltage,
which quantifies how bandgap engineering affects switching characteristics. Our
calculations clarify the classical-quantum crossover in sub-10 nm 2D FETs: as
$T$ rises, $J$ approaches the thermionic current; as $T$ falls, quantum
tunneling dominates, and the steep energy dependence of $\tau(E)$ may break the
classical limit of subthreshold swing imposed by the Boltzmann tyranny. The
optimal gating range ($V_g^\mathrm{ON}$, $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$) is investigated
for each temperature, insensitive to temperature in the high-temperature
regime, confirming the good thermal stability of the FET devices. A comparison
study demonstrates that the 4-row structure, with large $J_\mathrm{OFF}$ and
restricted operation range, is inappropriate for realistic FET applications.
The pristine structure has a high $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ ($\sim$1.1 V) makes it
less practical, since such a large threshold voltage may promote time-dependent
dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of the oxide layer, reducing device dependability.
The 6-row and 8-row structures exhibit more favorable $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ values
($\sim$0.75 V), achieving compromise, making them more promising candidates for
future FET integration.

Abstract: Extended efforts have been devoted to the study of strongly-interacting
excitons and their dynamics, towards macroscopic quantum states of matter such
as Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons and polaritons. Momentum-direct
layer-hybridized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted
considerable attention due to their high oscillator strength and dipolar
nature. However, the tunability of their interactions and dynamics remains
unexplored. Here, we achieve an unprecedented control over the nonlinear
properties of dipolar layer-hybridized excitons in an electrically gated van
der Waals homobilayer monitored by transient optical spectroscopy. By applying
a vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar
hybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two
main hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a
strongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by
electrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers,
we significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while
simultaneously increasing their decay times. Our findings have implications for
the search on quantum blockade and condensation of excitons and dipolaritons in
two-dimensional materials.

Abstract: We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence
in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a
tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct
class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at
ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of
the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to
the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference
patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior
characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the
duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum
behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence
dynamics in quantum mechanics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper explores the complex physics of microparticle fragmentation under laser irradiation, seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms for applications in photothermal nanosurgery.

Method: Ultrafast x-ray scattering and simulations based on the two-temperature model were used to study the thermal and structural evolution after laser excitation.

Result: Microparticles fragment within a nanosecond at fluences above 750 J/m², with the fragmentation mechanism involving a combination of strain and stress effects. Additional small clusters form at higher fluences (2700 J/m²) due to photothermal decomposition.

Conclusion: The fragmentation process is influenced by both thermal and mechanical effects, with photothermal phenomena contributing to the formation of small clusters. Further research is needed to optimize these processes for applications in nanosurgery.

Abstract: Laser fragmentation of suspended microparticles is an upcoming alternative to
laser ablation in liquid (LAL) that allows to streamline the the delivery
process and optimize the irradiation conditions for best efficiency. Yet, the
structural basis of this process is not well understood to date. Herein we
employed ultrafast x-ray scattering upon picosecond laser excitation of a gold
microparticle suspension in order to understand the thermal kinetics as well as
structure evolution after fragmentation. The experiments are complemented by
simulations according to the two-temperature model to verify the spatiotemporal
temperature distribution. It is found that above a fluence threshold of 750
J/m$^2$ the microparticles are fragmented within a nanosecond into several
large pieces where the driving force is the strain due to a strongly
inhomogenous heat distribution on the one hand and stress confinement due to
the ultrafast heating compared to stress propagation on the other hand. The
additional limited formation of small clusters is attributed to photothermal
decomposition on the front side of the microparticles at the fluence of 2700
J/m$^2$.

Abstract: Selectively exciting and manipulating phonons at nanoscale becomes more and

provides an extra degree of freedom to achieve versatile manipulation of axial
phonons in nanomaterials via coupling to spinful multi-physical fields, such as
circularly polarized infrared absorption. In particular, we demonstrate the
nanoscale one-way axial phonon excitation and routing in chiral nanomaterials,
by converting the photon spin in circularly polarized optical fields into the
collective interference phonon spin. As exemplified in the smallest chiral
carbon nanotube, we show that the rectification rate can reach nearly 100\%,
achieving an ideal one-way phonon router, which is verified by molecular

Result: 发现 OQCs 具有稳定且几乎恒定的能量间隙，具有层次状的态特性，并通过 tight-binding 模型描述其传输行为。

Conclusion: OQCs 展示了在碳纳米器件中的潜在应用价值，需进一步实验验证和优化设计。

Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of
carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to
unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the
electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature
Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed
through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory
(DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with
exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT
results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly
constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with
experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized
by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we
analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the
one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental
data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in
carbon nanodevices.

Abstract: We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots
(DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and
time-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose
to modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and
the exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of
operations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical
approximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to
numerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical
model. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state
performs the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal
ones.

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: The Visibility Graph (VG) method is reliable only with at least 1000 data points, while for Hurst exponent H ≤ 0.5, the critical exponent γ must be ≥ 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to assess the applicability and reliability of the Visibility Graph method for analyzing various types of time series, including Gaussian noises, stochastic processes, and chaotic systems. The study aims to establish practical guidelines for using the VG method effectively.

Method: The study investigates a range of time series, including Gaussian noises (white, pink, and blue), stochastic processes (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, fractional Brownian motion, and Levy flights), and chaotic systems (the logistic map). It employs the Visibility Graph method to analyze these time series to determine the minimum number of data points required and to evaluate two key descriptors: the degree distribution P(k) and the Hurst exponent H.

Result: The research concludes that the VG method requires a minimum of 1000 data points to be consistently applied. It also finds that for time series with a Hurst exponent H ≤ 0.5, the corresponding critical exponent γ must be ≥ 2. This clarifies the sensitivity of the VG method and provides practical guidelines for its application in analyzing stochastic and chaotic time series.

Conclusion: This paper contributes to the understanding of the Visibility Graph method's limitations and characteristics, offering valuable insights into its reliability for diverse time series analyses.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a range of time series, including Gaussian
noises (white, pink, and blue), stochastic processes (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,
fractional Brownian motion, and Levy flights), and chaotic systems (the
logistic map), using the Visibility Graph (VG) method. We focus on the minimum
number of data points required to use VG and on two key descriptors: the degree
distribution P(k), which often follows a power law P(k) ~ k^-gamma, and the
Hurst exponent H, which identifies persistent and antipersistent time series.
While the VG method has attracted growing attention in recent years, its
ability to consistently characterize time series from diverse dynamical systems
remains unclear. Our analysis shows that the reliable application of the VG
method requires a minimum of 1000 data points. Furthermore, we find that for
time series with a Hurst exponent H <= 0.5, the corresponding critical exponent
satisfies gamma >= 2. These results clarify the sensitivity of the VG method
and provide practical guidelines for its application in the analysis of
stochastic and chaotic time series.

### [66] [RG theory of spontaneous stochasticity for Sabra model of turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01204)
*Alexei A. Mailybaev*

Main category: nlin.CD

TL;DR: This paper presents a renormalization group (RG) approach to explain the phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity in fluctuating Sabra turbulence models. The RG operator connects the stochastic properties of systems with different dissipation and noise terms. A fixed point in this operator represents the stochastic process in the ideal limit, confirming convergence and universality. A complex dominant eigenmode explains slow, oscillatory convergence, which is validated numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding turbulence in complex systems, especially the role of viscosity and noise in leading to stochastic behavior, is crucial. The Sabra model is a simplified turbulence model, and this paper aims to explain the spontaneous stochasticity phenomenon through RG techniques.

Method: The authors employ a renormalization group approach, treating RG as an exact relation between stochastic properties of systems with varying dissipation and noise. They identify a fixed point of the RG operator to describe the ideal limit and analyze the linearized operator to determine the dominant eigenmode affecting convergence.

Result: The paper finds that the RG operator has a complex dominant eigenvalue, leading to slow, oscillatory convergence in the ideal limit. These predictions are supported by numerical simulations.

Conclusion: This work provides a theoretical framework for spontaneous stochasticity in turbulence, showing that the RG approach can explain universality and slow convergence through fixed points and eigenmode analysis.

Abstract: We consider fluctuating Sabra models of turbulence, which exhibit the
phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity: their solutions converge to a
stochastic process in the ideal limit, when both viscosity and small-scale
noise vanish. In this paper, we develop a renormalization group (RG) approach
to explain this phenomenon. Here, RG is understood as an exact relation between
the stochastic properties of systems with different dissipative and noise
terms, in contrast to the Kadanoff-Wilson coarse-graining procedure, which
involves small-scale integration. We argue that the stochastic process in the
ideal limit is represented as a fixed point of the RG operator. The existence
of such a fixed point confirms not only the convergence in the ideal limit, but
also the universality of the spontaneously stochastic process, i.e. its
independence from the type of dissipation and noise. The dominant eigenmode of
the linearized RG operator determines the leading correction in the convergence
process. The RG eigenvalue $\rho \approx 0.84 \exp(2.28i)$ is universal and it
turns out to be complex, which explains the rather slow and oscillatory
convergence in the ideal limit. These universality predictions are accurately
confirmed by numerical data.

Conclusion: 为将Thouless泵与Floquet相联系提供了一般性的途径

Abstract: We study symmetry preserving adiabatic and Floquet dynamics of
one-dimensional systems. Using quasiadiabatic evolution, we establish a
correspondence between adiabatic cycles and invertible defects generated by
spatially truncated Thouless pump operators. Employing the classification of
gapped phases by module categories, we show that the Thouless pumps are
classified by the group of autoequivalences of the module category. We then
explicitly construct Thouless pump operators for minimal lattice models with
$\text{Vec}_G$, Rep($G$), and Rep($H$) symmetries, and show how the Thouless
pump operators have the group structure of autoequivalences. The Thouless pump
operators, together with Hamiltonians with gapped ground states, are then used
to construct Floquet drives. An analytic solution for the Floquet phase diagram
characterized by winding numbers is constructed when the Floquet drives obey an
Onsager algebra. Our approach points the way to a general connection between
distinct Thouless pumps and distinct families of Floquet phases.

Abstract: Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of
interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge
states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms
generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the
intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered,
but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and
realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected
by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has
chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice
models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an
elementary proof that the $\theta$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to
multiples of $\pi$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic
skyrmions in condensed matter systems.

Abstract: We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of
optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7.
Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an
ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the
initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement.
The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on
pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs
and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear
susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from
ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification
of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric
systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our
experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear
properties in quantum materials.

Abstract: We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for
systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use
our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function
of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states
involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical
Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that
the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via
a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an
extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated
magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at
high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by
Luttinger's theorem.

Abstract: We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions,
i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate
gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic
hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from
double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that
enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to
achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against
available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods
are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM
systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading
to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by
including the correlation energy from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+
produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen
lattice systems.

Abstract: Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids
(QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored
over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum
systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications,
candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always
interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic
quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial
structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em
open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type
and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian
regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum
systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the
time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine
multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin
correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In
particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in
the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as
also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to
Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson
loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory
effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also
acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian
dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening
avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.

Abstract: Charge order is a widely observed and representative example of spontaneous
broken symmetries in quantum states of matter. Owing to the large intra-atomic
Coulomb energy, the charge redistribution in such an order typically implies
significant alteration of the electronic and lattice properties of materials.
While the standard description of charge order, namely a "charge density wave"
instability of the Fermi surface, has been broadly and successfully applied to
good metals, its applicability to correlated ionic materials has been rather
limited. Here, we propose an alternative general scenario of charge order -
crystallization of long-lived Frenkel excitons - suitable for these ionic
materials. We demonstrate this scenario on the recently discovered kagome
superconductors and successfully reproduce all the characteristics of
experimental observations on both local charge correlations and long-range
ordering. The proposed generic scenario offers a long-sought understanding of
charge order applicable to modern correlated functional materials.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Due to their iconic linearly vanishing density of states near the
zero-energy, half-filled two-dimensional Dirac materials in flat Euclidean and
negatively-curved hyperbolic spaces exhibit dynamic mass generation only once a
critical interaction strength is surpassed. Application of external magnetic
fields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered
phases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak
coupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been
proposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to
feature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the
zero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific
family of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite
value in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis
(arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic
fields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class
masses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent
phenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis. We anchor
this prediction from numerical self-consistent mean-field solutions of the
commuting class mass charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) order displaying a
staggered pattern of average electronic density (magnetization) between the
nearest neighboring sites of the half-filled Euclidean honeycomb and hyperbolic
{10, 3} and {14, 3} lattices, all featuring emergent non-Hermitian Dirac
quasiparticles, after decomposing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb (on-site
Hubbard) repulsion in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling behavior of
these two orders with magnetic field and non-Hermiticity over a wide range of
subcritical interactions.. Possible experimental setups to test our predictions
are discussed.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Investigating the high-pressure pyrolysis and oxidation of hydrogen and
syngas is essential for developing accurate combustion models under real engine
conditions. Accordingly, flow reactors have been increasingly used in these
fundamental combustion research at high-pressure conditions to achieve chemical
kinetic modeling. However, these previous chemical kinetic modeling for
pyrolysis and oxidation has almost been completely conducted based on ideal gas
assumption, which might fail at high-pressure conditions when real-fluid
behaviors become pronounced. Elucidating whether this is the case is urgent
given the high demand for high-pressure combustion and propulsion technologies.
Toward this, this study establishes a first-of-its-kind real-fluid modelling
framework for high-pressure flow reactors, where the physical molecular
interactions in real fluids are represented via coupling ab initio
intermolecular potentials with high-order Virial equation of state and further
with real-fluid thermochemistry, real-fluid chemical equilibrium, and
real-fluid conservation laws of species, mass, and momentum. Using the
developed framework, real-fluid effects in high-pressure flow reactors are
quantified through case studies of hydrogen and syngas oxidation, covering
pressure of 10-500 bar, temperature of 601-946 K, equivalence ratio of
0.0009-12.07, and dilution ratio of 5.9%-99.5%. The results reveal the strong
real-fluid effects in high-pressure flow reactors, where ignoring them can lead
to considerable errors in the simulated mole fractions, which are higher than
typical levels of measurements uncertainty in flow reactors. These errors can
lead to misinterpretation of the fundamental oxidation chemistry in
high-pressure flow reactors and pose significant errors in the developed
chemistry models, which should be adequately accounted for in future
high-pressure flow reactor studies.

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to advance the understanding of ultrafast electron dynamics in biological systems and explore potential applications in bio-optoelectronic components.

Method: The researchers used ultrafast electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy to study ultrafast light-induced changes in conductive networks.

Result: The results show increased π-electron density, enhanced conductivity, structural modifications, and real-space visualization of chemical changes. Ultrafast electron energy loss spectroscopy revealed picosecond-scale electron dynamics, including a decay and recovery of π-electron and plasmonic features attributed to electron-phonon coupling.

Conclusion: This work underscores the potential of ultrafast electron microscopy for studying ultrafast electron dynamics in biological systems and explores their applications as bio-optoelectronic components.

Abstract: Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has found widespread applications in
physics, chemistry, and materials science, enabling real-space imaging of
dynamics on ultrafast timescales. Recent advances have pushed the temporal
resolution of UEM into the attosecond regime, enabling the attomicroscopy
technique to directly visualize electron motion. In this work, we extend the
capabilities of this powerful imaging tool to investigate ultrafast electron
dynamics in a biological system by imaging and controlling light induced
electronic and chemical changes in the conductive network of multicellular
cable bacteria. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we first
observed a laser induced increase in {\pi}-electron density, accompanied by
spectral peak broadening and a blueshift features indicative of enhanced
conductivity and structural modification. We also traced the effect of
ultrafast laser pumping on bulk plasmon electron oscillations by monitoring
changes in the plasmon like resonance peak. Additionally, we visualized laser
induced chemical structural changes in cable bacteria in real space. The
imaging results revealed carbon enrichment alongside a depletion of nitrogen
and oxygen, highlighting the controllability of chemical dynamics. Moreover,
time resolved EELS measurements further revealed a picosecond scale decay and
recovery of both {\pi}-electron and plasmonic features, attributed to electron
phonon coupling. In addition to shedding light on the mechanism of electron
motion in cable bacteria, these findings demonstrate ultrafast modulation and
switching of conductivity, underscoring their potential as bio-optoelectronic

Result: The simulations reveal that amine head groups are preferentially positioned at the water domains' surfaces, creating micro-heterogeneity and domain oscillations that influence the scattering patterns.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the observed X-ray scattering behavior, highlighting the role of molecular interactions in aqueous systems.

Abstract: Aqueous alkylamine mixtures are studied by computer simulations in order to
understand the microscopic origin of the water rich side prominent x-ray
scattering pre-peaks reported in a recent study. These pre-peaks are puzzling
in view of the apparently contradicting facts that neat amines show pre-peaks
much weaker than neat alkanols, while water-rich aqueous alcohols do not. These
observations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head
group have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they
oppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show
micro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than
alcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.
  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure
factors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most
interesting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially
at the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl
tail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence
avoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines
are scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as
disordered bilayers. Hence, aqueous amines are analogous to an inverse micelle
melt and as precursor micro-emulsion.
  This stable micro-segregation produces large domain oscillations in the long
range part of the correlation functions, translating into positive pre-peaks
and negative anti-peaks in the related structure factors, the latter which
contribute destructively to produce the prominent scattering pre-peak observed
in the x-ray experiments.
  The model dependence is shown to be quite important, both for water and
solute models. The CHARMM-AA model associated with the SPC/E model seems to be
a good compromise.

Abstract: A diene-transmissive hetero-Diels-Alder strategy, grounded in previous
experimental works and employing boronated dienophiles, is proposed for the
synthesis of boron-bearing octahydroquinolines. To assess its feasibility,
three representative reactions were investigated, and their thermodynamics were
evaluated in toluene and acetonitrile at various temperatures using the WB97X-D
level of theory. The peri-, regio-, stereo-, and $\pi$-facial selectivities
were predicted. The reactions mechanisms were elucidated through exploration of
the reaction pathways. The predictions are consistent with available
experimental work, and show the reactions are feasible with low to moderate
polarity. The results also demonstrate that the reactions selectivity can in
some cases be tuned by judicious choice of reaction conditions to deliver
specific products with high selectivity.

Abstract: We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive
impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum
impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying
on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we
focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the
internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to
configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction
strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and
molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to
become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity
characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides
broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the
Fr\"ohlich paradigm.

Abstract: Exciton polariton condensates (EPCs) have emerged as a paradigmatic platform
for investigating nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, particularly due
to their intrinsic open-dissipative nature and strong nonlinear interactions
governed by the interplay between stimulated scattering and reservoir-mediated
damping. Recent advances in Feshbach resonance engineering now enable precise
tuning of interaction strengths, opening new avenues to explore exotic
nonlinear excitations in these driven-dissipative systems. In this work, we
systematically investigate the quench dynamics and stability of dark solitons
in repulsive one-dimensional EPCs under sudden parameter variations in both
nonlinear interaction strength g and pump intensity P. Through a Hamiltonian
variational approach that incorporates reservoir damping effects, we derive
reduced equations of motion for soliton velocity evolution that exhibit
remarkable qualitative agreement with direct numerical simulations of the
underlying open-dissipative Gross Pitaevskii equation. Our results reveal three
distinct dynamical regimes: (i) stable soliton propagation at intermediate pump
powers, (ii) velocity-dependent soliton breakup above critical pumping
thresholds, and (iii) parametric excitation of soliton trains under
simultaneous interaction quenches. These findings establish a quantitative
framework for understanding soliton dynamics in nonresonantly pumped EPCs, with
implications for quantum fluid dynamics and nonequilibrium Bose Einstein
condensates.

Abstract: We study vortex-vortex and vortex-wave collisions in two-dimensional weakly
interacting Bose-Einstein condensates, processes that play a central role in
decaying quantum turbulence. Using numerical simulations of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that during collisions of vortex-antivortex
dipoles, the kinetic energy is transferred from incompressible to compressible
modes by two distinct mechanisms. Below the critical vortex separation for
annihilation, the transfer is mediated by quantum energy released during
annihilation events, while above the threshold it arises from vortex
acceleration. In wave-vortex collisions, an incoming solitary wave splits into
transient phase slips that interact with the vortex, one of the phase slips
contributes to vortex annihilation, and the other phase slip acquires a stable
core and forms a new vortex. By analyzing vortex trajectories and energy
spectra, we provide new insights into energy transfer mechanisms in quantum
turbulence and offer broader implications for topological interactions mediated
by vortices.

Abstract: Algebraic non-covariant gauges are used often in string theory, Chern-Simons
theory, gravitation and gauge theories. Loop integrals, however, have spurious
singularities that need to be regularized. The most popular and consistent
regularization is the Mandelstam- Leibbrandt(ML) prescription.
  This paper extends the ML prescription outside the light cone. It shares all
the properties of
  light-cone ML regularization: It preserves naive power counting and gauge
  invariance. Moreover, using dimensional regularization(DR), we get a closed
  form for the basic integrals, including divergent and finite pieces. These
results simplify calculations in gauge theories and open new avenues for
applications in non-local models.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper discusses the thermodynamics of five-dimensional AdS spacetime at finite temperature and rotation using the Euclidean path integral. It suggests that at low temperatures and finite rotation, the dual gauge theory is in a confined thermal state. However, it finds that there are bulk saddles with smaller on-shell action than the rotating thermal gas, which do not contribute to the low-temperature partition function. This supports the idea that the rotating thermal gas is the correct background for the dual gauge theory at low temperatures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is relevant to understanding the thermodynamics of AdS spacetime and its dual gauge theory under various conditions, particularly at low temperatures and finite rotations.

Method: The authors use Euclidean path integrals, examine black hole solutions with complex parameters, and employ mini-superspace approximations and steepest descent to analyze the saddles contributing to the partition function.

Result: The paper demonstrates that certain bulk saddles do not contribute to the low-temperature partition function, thereby confirming that the rotating thermal gas is the correct background for the dual gauge theory.

Conclusion: This analysis provides further evidence for the original claim that the rotating thermal gas is the correct background for the dual gauge theory at low temperatures, even though it uncovers additional saddles that do not contribute to the low-temperature regime.

Abstract: We revisit thermodynamics of five-dimensional AdS spacetime at finite
temperature and rotation using the Euclidean path integral. It is generally
believed that at low temperatures and finite rotation, the bulk saddle point
that governs the thermodynamics describes a rotating gas of thermal radiation.
Consequently, the dual gauge theory at low temperatures is in a confined
thermal state. We demonstrate that this holographic expectation is at odds with
the fact that, even at low temperatures, there exist saddles of the bulk path
integral with real part of on-shell action smaller than that of the thermal
rotating gas. The usual Kerr-AdS black holes but with complex parameters are
examples of such saddles. Using mini-superspace ideas and steepest descent, we
argue that these additional saddles do not actually feature in the low
temperature partition function. This saves the original claim that rotating
thermal gas is indeed the correct background for understanding the dual gauge
theory at low temperatures. As a corollary, we also find that the unstable
small rotating black hole does not contribute to the partition function at any
temperature, even in a suppressed manner.

Abstract: Few vacua are known for the three tachyon-free non-supersymmetric string
theories. We find new classes of AdS backgrounds by focusing on spaces where

examples involve non-zero three-form fluxes supported either on direct product
internal spaces or on $T_{p,q}$ geometries. For the
${\mathrm{SO}}(16)\times{\mathrm{SO}}(16)$ heterotic string, we then develop a
method to engineer vacua with the addition of gauge fields. A formal
Kaluza--Klein reduction yields complete solutions on a broad class of coset
spaces $G/H$, automatically satisfying the three-form Bianchi identities with
$H$-valued gauge fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Euclidean path integrals can be used to prepare states of a Lorentzian QFT.
So long as any sources are turned off on the $t=0$ surface, the resulting
Lorentzian states all belong to the same Hilbert space. Constructing more
states than allowed by the Lorentzian density of states means that the
resulting states must be linearly dependent. For large amplitude sources and a
fixed cutoff on energy, the AdS bulk dual of this effect has been conjectured
to be captured by spacetime wormholes. Wormholes should then be generic in the
presence of large such Euclidean sources.
  This hypothesis can be studied in a context with asymptotically locally
AdS$_4$ boundaries of topology $S^1 \times S^2$ in which the wormhole is
supported by a source for minimally-coupled massless bulk scalars. In
preparation for a later more complete study, we consider here a preliminary toy
version of the model in which the spacetimes are cohomogeneity-1, but with the
consequence that the sources do not vanish at $t=0$. We then find that generic
sources at large masses do {\it not} lead to wormholes. Along the way we map
out the phase diagram for wormhole, thermal AdS, and black hole phases of our
cohomogeneity-1 ansatz. We also numerically evaluate their stability by
identifying negative modes. In parallel with the previously-studied case of
$S^3$ boundaries, the results are analogous to those associated with the
familiar Hawking-Page transition.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We apply the quantum-mechanics bootstrap to supersymmetric quantum mechanics
(SUSY QM) and to its matrix relative, the Marinari-Parisi model, which is
conjectured to describe the worldvolume of unstable $D0$ branes. Using
positivity of moment matrices together with Heisenberg, gauge, and
(zero-temperature) thermal constraints, we obtain rigorous bounds on
ground-state data. In the cases where SUSY is spontaneously broken, we find
bounds that apply to the lowest-energy normalizable eigenstate.
  For $N = 1$ SUSY QM with a cubic superpotential, we obtain tight bounds that
agree well with available approximation methods. At weak coupling they match
well with the semiclassical instanton contribution to SUSY-breaking
ground-state energy, while at strong coupling they exhibit the expected scaling
and match well with Hamiltonian truncation.
  For the SUSY matrix QM, we construct a $44 \times 44$ bootstrap matrix and
obtain bounds at large $N$. At strong coupling, we obtain the expected $E \sim
\kappa \ g^{2/3}$ scaling of $E$ with $g$ and extract a lower bound on the
coefficient $\kappa > .196$. At small coupling, the theory has a critical point
$g_c$ where the two wells merge into one. We find a spurious kink at $g =
\sqrt{2} g_c$. We attribute this to truncation error and solver limitations,
and discuss possible improvements.

Abstract: We explore the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in scenarios
suggested by high-scale supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, where the
inflaton is forced to climb a steep exponential potential. We can do it at the
price of some simplifications, and more importantly with some assumptions on
the softening effects of String Theory. These suggest a scenario proposed long
ago by Gasperini and Veneziano, where the initial singularity is replaced by a
bounce, and the resulting analysis rests on a scale $\Delta$ that leaves some
signs in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. The amplitude comprises two
types of contribution: the first oscillates around the original result of
Maldacena and gives no further prospects to detect a non-Gaussian signal, but
the second, which is subtly tied to the turning point at the end of the
climbing phase, within the window 62<N<66 for the inflationary e-folds could be
compatible with Planck constraints and potentially observable. The amplitudes
involving the tensor modes contain only the first type of contribution.

Abstract: Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua,
and coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can
produce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in
contexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of
near-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift
horizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on
scalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion
parameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all
other fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in
certain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity. A possible
generalization to semiclassical spacetimes that violate the NEC, but satisfy a
strengthened version of the quantum focusing condition (QFC), is proposed. In
cosmology, the FEB constrains the extent of large field excursions to be
linearly bounded by the number of e-folds, independent of the inflationary
model. This has notable implications for anthropic scenarios, where large
excursions are often invoked to access favorable vacua.

Abstract: While the supergravity limit of AdS/CFT has been extensively explored, the
regime in which stringy dynamics dominate, characterized by the emergence of an
infinite tower of higher-spin massive modes, is far less understood. In this
work, we leverage techniques from algebraic quantum field theory to investigate
the extent to which hallmark features of bulk gravity survive at finite string
tension and the emergence of intrinsically stringy phenomena. Working in the
$g_s\rightarrow 0$ limit, we model excited string modes as free particles and
demonstrate that the resulting Hagedorn spectrum leads to the breakdown of the
split property, a strengthening of the locality principle, for regions that are
within a string length of each other. We propose that this leads to a precise
algebraic definition of stretched horizons and stretched quantum extremal
surfaces. When stretched horizons exist, there is an associated nontrivial
horizon $\star$-algebra.Furthermore, applying the algebraic ER=EPR proposal
leads to the emergence of type III${}_{0}$ von Neumann factors, which provide
an intriguing characterization of how such regions can have a quantum
Einstein-Rosen bridge even if they are geometrically disjoint.

Abstract: We construct a holographic model for an s+p superconductor with axion-induced
translation symmetry breaking within the framework of gauge/gravity duality,
working in the probe limit. The equations of motion are solved numerically to
investigate the influence of the parameter $k/T$ on the competition and
coexistence between the s-wave and p-wave orders. We find that increasing $k/T$
suppresses the thermodynamic stability of both the single condensate s-wave and
p-wave solutions. With the $k-\mu$ phase diagram and the condensate curves, we
see that the region dominated by the single condensate p-wave phase gradually
decreases with the increasing of $k/T$, finally leaving only the single
condensate s-wave phase in the large $k/T$ region, which is explained by the
grand potential curves showing a slower decreasing of the thermodynamic
stability for the s-wave solution than that for the p-wave solution.
Furthermore, a larger minimum ratio of the charges $q_p/q_s$ is required to
stabilize the s+p coexistent phase as $k/T$ increases, and we determine the
precise dependence of this critical ratio on $k/T$. Finally, our study of the
optical conductivity reveals that the gap frequency increases with $k/T$. A
characteristic kink, associated with the s+p coexistent phase, is identified in
the dependence of gap frenquency on $k/T$, which could serve as a potential
experimental signature for detecting multi-condensate superconductivity.

Abstract: To each four dimensional $\mathcal{N}\geq 2$ supersymmetric quantum field
theory, one can associate an algebraic completely integrable (ACI) system that
encodes the low energy dynamics of theory. In this paper we explicitly derive
the appropriate ACI systems for the global forms of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super
Yang-Mills (sYM) using isogenies of polarised abelian varieties. In doing so,
we relate the complex moduli of the resulting varieties to the exactly marginal
coupling of the theory, thus allowing us to probe the $S$-duality groups of the
global forms. Finally, we comment on whether the resulting varieties are the
Jacobians of a minimal genus Riemann surface, coming to the conclusion that
many global forms of $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM do not admit a minimal genus
Seiberg-Witten curve that correctly reproduces the global form.

Abstract: The low energy effective theory on the moduli space of vacua of 4d
superYang-Mills (sYM) theory defines a special K\"ahler geometry. For simple
sYM gauge algebras, $\mathfrak{g}$, we classify all compatible special K\"ahler
structures by showing that they are in one-to-one correspondence with certain
equivalence classes of integral symplectic representations of the Weyl group of
$\mathfrak{g}$. We further demonstrate that, for principal Dirac pairing, these
equivalence classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the S-duality orbits
of the global structures of the corresponding $\mathfrak{g}$ sYM gauge theory,
after a mistake in the field theory literature is corrected. This provides a
low-energy test of S-duality. We also discuss twisted product geometries made
from factors with special K\"ahler structures with non-principal Dirac
pairings.

Abstract: We investigate the solution-generating technique based on the
Breitenlohner-Maison (BM) linear system, for asymptotically flat, stationary,
bi-axisymmetric black hole solutions with various horizon topologies in
five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. We construct the monodromy matrix
associated with the BM linear system, which provides a unified framework for
describing three distinct asymptotically flat, vacuum black hole solutions with
a single angular momentum in five dimensions, each with a different horizon
topology: (i) the singly rotating Myers-Perry black hole, (ii) the
Emparan-Reall black ring, and (iii) the Chen-Teo rotating black lens.
Conversely, by solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem using the
procedure developed by Katsimpouri et al., we demonstrate that factorization of
the monodromy matrix exactly reproduces these vacuum solutions, thereby
reconstructing the three geometries. These constitute the first explicit
examples in which the factorization procedure has been carried out for black
holes with non-spherical horizon topologies. In addition, we discuss how the
asymptotic behavior of five-dimensional vacuum solutions at spatial infinity is
reflected in the asymptotic structure of the monodromy matrix in the spectral
parameter space.

Abstract: We investigate a novel class of defects in the critical $\mathrm{O}(2N)$

under rotations transverse to the defect. Instead, they only preserve a
combination of transverse rotations and a global symmetry. These defects are
constructed as IR fixed points of RG flows originating at monodromy defects,
triggered by a relevant operator with non-zero transverse spin. Using large-$N$
and $4-\varepsilon$ expansions, we compute leading-order scaling dimensions of
defect operators and the one-point functions of the bulk fields. In various
limits this theory coincides with the monodromy defect or the pinning field
defect, and we compare our results to existing results for these defects.

### [99] [Light deflection in axially symmetric stationary spacetimes filled with a moving medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01326)
*Christian Pfeifer,Barbora Bezděková,Oleg Yu. Tsupko*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper explores how light is bent near massive objects when traveling through different media, considering both the object's rotation and the medium's motion. They use a geometric optics approach and find that the medium's radial motion doesn't significantly affect deflection, while rotation and medium speed can produce similar observational effects under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding light deflection in varying media and spacetimes is crucial for testing theories like general relativity and has implications for gravitational lensing and black hole studies.

Method: Mathematical analysis and modeling of light paths in axially symmetric, stationary spacetimes with moving media. They derive expressions for deflection angles under different motion scenarios.

Result: The paper reveals that the radial motion of the medium doesn't affect light deflection in certain limits, and slow rotation of the object and medium can mimic each other's effects on light paths under specific conditions.

Conclusion: This study deepens our understanding of light behavior in dynamic media and rotating spacetimes, offering new insights into gravitational lensing and potential observational tests for general relativity models.

Abstract: The deflection of light rays near gravitating objects can be influenced not
only by gravity itself but also by the surrounding medium. Analytical studies
of such effects are possible within the geometrical optics approximation, where
the medium introduces additional light bending due to refraction. These studies
typically assume a cold non-magnetized plasma, for which light propagation is
independent of the medium's velocity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to
the general case of dispersive refractive media in motion and study its
influence on light deflection. We consider an axially symmetric stationary
spacetime filled with a moving medium, motivated by the interplay between
rotational effects originating from the spacetime and those induced by the
medium's motion. We begin by analyzing light deflection in the equatorial plane
of a rotating object in the presence of a radially moving and rotating medium.
Assuming a specific form of the refractive index enables a fully analytic
treatment. In the particular cases of either pure radial or pure rotational
motion, we obtain explicit expressions for the deflection angle. Next, we
analyze the case of a slowly moving medium and identify two particularly
interesting results. First, we show that, to the first order in the medium's
velocity, the radial motion does not affect the light deflection. Second,
assuming slow rotation of the gravitating object, we demonstrate that the black
hole rotation and the medium motion can produce equivalent observational
signatures. We find the quantitative condition under which these effects
compensate each other. This relation becomes particularly clear for a Kerr
black hole, discussed as an example.

quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors,
highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared
to the classical case of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Furthermore, we
analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing
quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both

Abstract: We discuss the emission of pairs of photons by charges with generic
worldlines in the Minkowski vacuum from the viewpoint of inertial observers and
interpret them from the perspective of Rindler observers. We show that the
emission of pairs of Minkowski photons corresponds, in general, to three
distinct processes according to Rindler observers: scattering, and emission and
absorption of pairs of Rindler photons. In the special case of uniformly
accelerated charges, the radiation observed in the inertial frame can be fully
described by the scattering channel in the Rindler frame. Therefore, the
emission of pairs of Minkowski photons -- commonly referred to as Unruh
radiation -- can be seen as further evidence supporting the Unruh effect.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Six-dimensional cosmological model with Einstein-Hilbert action and conformal Weyl term cubed, analyzed for solutions with static subspaces. There exist solutions with two or three large dimensions. A favorable solution with three large extra dimensions is stable under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring higher-dimensional cosmological models and their potential for accommodating large extra dimensions is a well-motivated research direction in theoretical physics. This paper contributes to understanding the behavior of such models under specific conditions.

Method: The authors analyze the equations of motion derived from the model's action, focusing on isolating and numerically solving the highest derivative terms to identify stable cosmological solutions.

Result: The analysis reveals the existence of flat anisotropic solutions where one or more subspaces become static. Depending on the cosmological constant's value, the dimensionality of the static subspaces varies. Notably, a physically preferable solution with three large space dimensions and two compactified extra dimensions is found to be stable within a specific range of coupling constants.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates the possibility of obtaining stable compactifications of extra dimensions in a six-dimensional cosmological model with a specific action structure. The findings contribute to the broader discussion on the constraints and implications for theories positing additional spatial dimensions.

Abstract: We consider the background cosmological solutions in the $6D$
(six-dimensional) model with one time and five space coordinates. The theory of
our interest has the action composed by the Einstein term, cosmological
constant, and two conformal terms constructed from the third powers of the Weyl
tensor. It is shown how the highest derivative terms in the equations of motion
can be isolated that opens the way for their numerical integration. There are
flat anisotropic solutions which make one of the flat isotropic subspaces to be
static. Depending on the value of bare cosmological constant, either
two-dimensional or three-dimensional subspace can be static. In particular,
there is a physically favorable solution with three ``large'' space coordinates
and two extra inner dimensions stabilized. This solution is stable for a wide
range of coupling constants, but this requires a special value of the bare
cosmological constant.

Abstract: The Weyl double copy formalism, which relates the Weyl spinor with the square
of the field strength, is studied in the context of Hassan-Rosen bigravity for
stationary and time-dependent solutions. We consider the dyonic
Kerr-Newman-(A)dS solution and the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski metric in the
context of bigravity. These solutions are studied in the Weyl double copy both
with matter independently coupled and show that no massive modes are present in
the Weyl spinor. The equations of motion for the gauge and scalar fields are
those of Maxwell equations coupled to an external source, and massless
Klein-Gordon equations with a conformal curvature term and an external source,
all of them consistent with general relativity. For wave solutions, massive
modes are manifest in the Weyl spinor and a formulation in bigravity for these
massive modes is proposed. The resulting equations of motion are Proca
equations with a conformal term and massive Klein-Gordon equations. In the case
of the matter contributions for waves, we show how the resonance mass is
present in equations of motion of the fields obtained from the Weyl double
copy. The solutions studied are written in a Kerr-Schild form, connecting with
the Kerr-Schild double copy.

Abstract: We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound
for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on
spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological
constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the
slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and
controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first
Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly
mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p\,r \ge
\hbar/2$, whose constant is optimal and never attained (Corollary). This result
abstracts and extends the framework recently introduced for black-hole slices

Abstract: Non-local gravity can potentially solve several problems of gravitational

theories of gravity in the metric-affine framework. In particular, we study the
dynamics of metric-affine analogue of some well-studied non-local theories, by
treating the metric and the connection as independent fields. The approach
gives the opportunity to deal with non-local gravity under a more general
standard. Furthermore, we introduce some novel non-local metric-affine theories
with no Riemannian analogue and investigate their dynamics. Finally we discuss
some cosmological applications of our development.

*Yi Lu,Xiao-Yin Pan,Meng-Yun Lai,Qing-hai Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that non-trivial rotating global monopoles cannot exist in Einstein's general relativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of global monopoles is important as they are predicted by grand unified theories and have significant astrophysical and cosmological relevance, such as their impact on gravitational lensing and spacetime geometry.

Method: The authors employed the Newman-Janis algorithm to explore metrics of rotating monopoles and conducted asymptotic analysis on static, axially symmetric spacetimes to identify regular solutions.

Result: The analysis conclusively shows that the only regular solution at large distances for a static, spherically symmetric monopole is without rotation, thereby proving the non-existence of non-trivial rotating monopole solutions.

Conclusion: This result reinforces the understanding that global monopoles must remain non-rotating or their existence would contradict general relativity, emphasizing the need for further exploration of alternative scenarios where rotation might be accommodated.

Abstract: Global monopoles are topological defects predicted by certain grand unified
theories and have been extensively studied for their astrophysical and
cosmological implications, including their distinctive spacetime geometry and
characteristic gravitational lensing effects. Despite this interest, an exact
solution for a global monopole remains elusive, with research largely confined
to approximations of the static, spherically symmetric case. This paper
addresses the fundamental question of whether a rotating global monopole can
exist as a solution to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations. We first
prove that metrics generated by applying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the
static monopole are inconsistent with the scalar field's equation of motion.
Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis for general static, axially
symmetric spacetimes and establish that the only such solution that is regular
at large distances is the spherically symmetric one. These results lead to the
definitive conclusion that non-trivial, rotating global monopole solutions are
forbidden within the framework of Einstein's general relativity.

immersed in a swirling spacetime. We find that the spin-spin interaction
between the angular momentum of the black hole and the swirling of the
background leads to new interesting effects as it breaks the symmetry between
the upper and lower hemispheres. One of the new features of the spin-spin
interaction is the existence of up to three light rings for suitable choices of
the angular momentum parameter $a$ and swirling parameter $j$. In comparison to
the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a swirling universe, the light rings
typically all possess different radii.

### [108] [Perturbations of Minkowski spacetime with regular conformal compactification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01964)
*Andrea Nützi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper studies perturbations of Minkowski spacetime in general relativity with specific decay rate towards Kerr data. It constructs a regular conformal compactification at null and timelike infinity, with regularity increasing when the decay rate is faster. The approach involves a novel formulation of Einstein equations, allowing the problem to be expressed as regular quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic PDE at null infinity but not at spacelike infinity. The key result is the construction of perturbations that remain smooth under such conditions. Results rely on tailored energy estimates and scaling properties. The paper generalizes previous work where the initial data coincided with Kerr data. The analysis highlights the behavior of Kerr asymptotically and provides a novel method for constructing such spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the stability and behavior of spacetimes under perturbations is fundamental in general relativity. This paper explores perturbations of Minkowski spacetime that evolve to a Kerr spacetime, offering insights into how such spacetimes transition and their properties under these specific conditions.

Method: The authors introduce a novel formulation of the Einstein equations around Minkowski spacetime, casts it as a regular quasilinear symmetric hyperbolic PDE near null infinity. This allows them to study the evolution near null and timelike infinity. They analyze the equations by organizing them according to their homogeneity about spacelike infinity, classifying terms as leading or lower order. They employ tailored energy estimates to construct solutions with the specified regularity.

Result: The main result is that perturbations of Minkowski spacetime, with initial data decaying inverse polynomially towards Kerr data, admit a conformal compactification that is regular at null and timelike infinity. The degree of this regularity increases with the decay rate. In particular, when the initial data decays rapidly, the compactification is smooth. This extends previous work where the initial data exactly matched Kerr data outside a compact set. The regularity at null infinity suggests a well-behaved asymptotic structure for such spacetimes, while the behavior at spacelike infinity is influenced by the asymptotic properties of Kerr spacetime.

Conclusion: This work provides a significant advancement in understanding the behavior of spacetimes under specific perturbation conditions. The novel formulation of Einstein's equations and the analysis of homogeneity properties contribute to comprehending the stability and asymptotic behavior of spacetimes near different infinities. The results are a notable step toward addressing the question of whether general perturbed spacetimes can evolve to exhibit Kerr geometry at null infinity.

Abstract: We construct perturbations of Minkowski spacetime in general relativity, when
given initial data that decays inverse polynomially to initial data of a Kerr
spacetime towards spacelike infinity. We show that the perturbations admit a
regular conformal compactification at null and timelike infinity, where the
degree of regularity increases linearly with the rate of decay of the initial
data to Kerr initial data. In particular, the compactification is smooth if the
initial data decays rapidly to Kerr initial data. This generalizes results of
Friedrich, who constructed spacetimes with a smooth conformal compactification
in the case when the initial data is identical to Kerr initial data on the
complement of a compact set. Our results rely on a novel formulation of the
Einstein equations about Minkowski spacetime introduced by the author, that
allows one to formulate the dynamic problem as a quasilinear, symmetric
hyperbolic PDE that is regular at null infinity and with null infinity being at
a fixed locus. It is not regular at spacelike infinity, due to the asymptotics
of Kerr. Thus the main technical task is the construction of solutions near
spacelike infinity, using tailored energy estimates. To accomplish this, we
organize the equations according to homogeneity with respect to scaling about
spacelike infinity, which identifies terms that are leading, respectively lower
order, near spacelike infinity, with contributions from Kerr being lower order.

Conclusion: 研究人员提出了一种新的分类方法来解释不同宇宙结构对黑洞形成的影响。

Abstract: We show that the threshold to form a black hole, in an asymptotically flat
and radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, is not solely
(mainly) determined by the behaviour of the compaction function at its maximum,
as earlier thought, but also by the three-dimensional curvature at smaller (but
super-horizon) scales, which we call "the core". We find three classes of
initial conditions characterized by an open (O), closed (C), or flat (F) FRW
core surrounded by a shell with higher three-dimensional curvature. In the C
case, the core helps the collapse so that the black hole formation threshold is
there the lowest among all cases. Type-II black holes might only be generated
by Type-O or F (each of those with different thresholds, with O being the
highest) or by a Type-C with an effective F core. Finally, we argue that an F
core is typically more probable for a sharp power spectrum, however, it is also
more likely related to non-spherical initial conditions. On the other hand, a
very broad power spectrum, which might be related to the observed NanoGrav
signal, would favor the formation of Type-I black holes with a mass spectrum
peaked at the Infra-Red scale.

Abstract: The perturbation spectra of black hole (BH) beyond standard general
relativity (GR) may exhibit complex structures with long-lived modes that
generate echo-like modulations on the ringdown signal. However, a systematic
framework for understanding the internal structure of such spectra, the
physical nature of different mode families, and their dynamical excitation is
still undeveloped. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a
potential methodology that combines frequency-domain classification with
time-domain analysis, using a hairy Schwarzschild BH that admits a double-peak
perturbative potential as a theoretical platform. Our analysis of the
quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum identifies two distinct families of modes: the
photon sphere (PS) family, arising from delocalized scattering resonances, and
the echo family, corresponding to highly localized quasi-bound states. We then
develop a windowed energy analysis framework in the time domain, which
discloses a dynamic competition for dominance between these families. In
particular, our results explicitly show that this competition is sensitive to
the properties of the initial perturbation source, and that higher-overtone
echo modes can dominate in the observed signal, which are in contrast to the
standard PS mode in GR. This study establishes the dynamic evolution of this
energy competition as a new observational signature for probing new physics and
further motivate a supplemental framework for analyzing long-lived ringdown

Motivation: 理解量子世界中万有引力的普遍性，是基本物理学的关键问题。

Result: 一般情况下，自由下落的普遍性被破坏，但存在某些模型保留了这一特性，且预测了牛顿势的修改。

Conclusion: Planck尺度下修正的牛顿引力会导致自由下落普遍性普遍被破坏，但存在特定模型保留了这一性质。

Abstract: The universality of free fall is one of the most cherished principles in
classical gravity. Its fate in the quantum world is one of the key questions in
fundamental physics. We investigate the universality of free fall in the
context of Planck scale modifications of Newtonian gravity. Starting from a
doubly-special-relativity setting we take the Newtonian limit to obtain
deformed Galilean relativity. We study the interaction between two test
particles, subject to deformed Galilean relativity, and a classical, undeformed
gravitational source, the Earth. Such an interaction is investigated here for
the first time. Considering the two test particles falling freely in the
source's gravitational field, we examine whether the universality of free fall
is affected by deformed relativistic symmetries. We show that, in general, the
universality of free fall is violated. Remarkably, we find that there exist
distinguished models for which the universality of free fall is realized and
which predict a specific modification of the Newtonian potential.

Motivation: 用弦连接两个振荡点粒子的动态系统超出了静态系统范围。

Method: 利用细长的Hawking-Page-Maldacena型弦研究点粒子与弦的相互作用。

Result: 在有限长弦两端引入两个点粒子，并对其进行振荡研究发现，粒子的质量与时空结构表现出特定的相互作用模式。

Conclusion: 点粒子通过两端的振荡弦相互连接，并在动态系统中展示出新的相互作用特性。

Abstract: BTZ spacetime is a long-known locally AdS solution to the Einstein equations
in 1 timelike and 2 spacelike dimensions. Its static variant is interpreted as
a black hole whose mass is related to the period of the angular coordinate.
This solution can be parametrically continued into one without horizons but
with a conical deficit in the center. Such a solution is interpreted as a
spacetime with a massive particle. It has been shown that this particle can be
in static equilibrium with a cosmic string passing through the spacetime to
infinity. In this work, we explore the interaction of point particles with
strings, such as a bound system of two particles connected by a string of
finite length. We identify additive local mass in the static spacetimes and
apply it to the case of particles and strings. Finally, using the cut and glue
method, we construct the system of two particles oscillating on the string,
which goes out of the scope of static systems.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This research presents a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background, focusing on binary black holes, neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. By systematically analyzing uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and merger rate evolution, they derive credible bands for the background spectrum, giving insights into current and future detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational waves offer a unique way to probe the universe, and understanding their background is essential for interpreting observations and detecting events.

Method: The study uses population statistics and numerical simulations to model the gravitational-wave background, considering various sources and their uncertainties.

Result: They successfully model the background spectrum, providing confidence intervals for future detections and the interpretation of current upper limits.

Conclusion: This work bridges population modeling with waveform theory, empowering the detection and interpretation of gravitational waves from compact binary mergers.

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences
is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation
searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history
of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the
high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is
challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties.
In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical
gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars,
and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of
uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of
the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible
bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude
in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to
facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.

TL;DR: 字符串理论预测负的，观察宇宙膨胀需要正的cosmological常数Λ。解决方案是弦理论中的渐近安全量子引力，通过量子重 normalize群方法。但前者可能描述不稳定的世界，后者缺乏温度，这对早期宇宙很重要。我们提出了一种修改后的热RG方法，考虑温度参数T作为紧致时间维半径的倒数，就像时空 foliation那样。在我们的场景中，不是温度T而是无量纲温度τ=T/k在RG尺度k趋于零时保持不变，弦理论发生在一个非常高的温度下，而中间和低温度下由渐近安全的量子引力主导。我们显示，热RG对无穷大温度的渐近安全量子引力模型的研究导致负的cosmological常数，而低温下则变为正数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解宇宙中的cosmological常数Λ的正负性差异对弦理论和量子引力框架的适用性具有重要意义。

Method: 通过引入修改后的热RG方法，使用RG流研究渐近安全的量子引力模型在不同温度下的行为。

Result: 在高温度下，Λ为负；在低温下，Λ为正。

Conclusion: 通过温度依赖的RG方法，我们在不同温度下观察到了Λ的符号变化，这可能解释了实验中的测Λ值与理论预测的差异。

Abstract: String theories naturally predict a negative, while observations on the
exponential expansion of the present Universe requires a positive value for the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Solution to resolve this discrepancy is known
in the framework of string theory and given for Asymptotically Safe (AS)
quantum gravity by using Renormalization Group (RG). However, the former might
describes unstable worlds and the latter lacks the inclusion of temperature
which is otherwise crucial in the early Universe. Here we present a proposal
for resolving this conflict by using a modified thermal RG method where the
temperature parameter $T$ is given by the inverse radius of the compactified
time-like dimension, similarly to spacetime foliation. In our scenario not the
dimensionful temperature $T$, but the dimensionless temperature $\tau = T/k$ is
kept constant when the RG scale $k$ is sent to zero and string theory is
assumed to take place at very high while AS quantum gravity at intermediate and
low temperatures. We show that the modified thermal RG study of AS quantum
gravity models at very high temperatures results in a negative cosmological
constant while turns it into a positive parameter for low temperatures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着FCC-ee expecting to operate at ultra-high repetition rates and measure extremely diverse bunches, traditional monitors are inadequate. Hence, developing a state-of-the-art single-shot EO monitor is essential for effective commissioning and energy calibration.

Method: 采用了单通过式设计，以棱镜取代反射镜指导激光穿过晶体，实现了对较长 bunch的测量。探测器在真空环境中工作，确保了测量的准确性。

Result: 原型在空气中进行了测试，证明了单通过式棱镜EO探测器的设计原理和可行性，为FCC-ee的建设和运行奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该探测器的成功设计和测试，显著提升了FCC-ee的纵向轮廓测量能力，为复杂的高能粒子加速器提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: The Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee) presents challenges for a
longitudinal bunch profile monitor due to its wide range of bunch lengths and
charge densities across its four distinct operational modes. For commissioning,
monitoring the top-up injection, and energy calibration, the FCC-ee requires
non-destructive, single-shot measurements of the bunch length and profile. This
contribution proposes an in-vacuum electro-optical (EO) longitudinal bunch
profile monitor for single-shot measurements at high repetition rates, building
on the successful EO monitor at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) at
the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A novel single-pass conceptual design
for the in-vacuum holder of the electro-optical crystal is presented, utilizing
prisms instead of a mirror to guide the laser through the crystal, which
additionally allows measurements of the long bunches foreseen for FCC-ee
operation mode at the Z-pole energy. A first prototype has been constructed and
tested at the in-air test stand of the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for
Research (CLEAR). Results from the prototype tests are presented, demonstrating
the proof of principle for the single-pass prism-based EO monitor design for
FCC-ee.

### [116] [Accurate Modelling of Intrabeam Scattering and its Impact on Photoinjectors for Free-Electron Lasers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02058)
*Thomas Geoffrey Lucas,Paolo Craievich,Eduard Prat,Sven Reiche,Erion Gjonaj*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: Intrabeam scattering (IBS) is crucial for high-brightness electron machines but has been overlooked in RF photoinjector modeling. Simulations show IBS increases the slice energy spread (SES) in the injector, particularly at the source. Results highlight the importance of considering IBS in photoinjector design and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improves understanding of IBS effects on photoinjector performance.

Method: Developed a Monte Carlo simulation model and a new analytical model.

Result: IBS increases SES throughout the injector, especially at the source. 5D brightness is mostly conserved, but 6D brightness degrades with propagation.

Conclusion: Must include IBS in the accurate design and optimization of photoinjectors.

Abstract: Intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a fundamental effect that can limit the
performance of high-brightness electron machines, yet it has so far been
neglected in standard modelling of RF photoinjectors. Recent measurements at
SwissFEL reveal that the slice energy spread (SES) in the injector is
significantly underestimated by conventional tracking codes. In this work, we
present a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation model that accurately predicts the
IBS-induced SES growth in the photoinjector of an X-ray free-electron laser.
The simulations are benchmarked against SES measurements at the SwissFEL as
well as theoretically supported by a new analytical model. The results
demonstrate that IBS-induced SES growth occurs throughout the injector, most
prominently in the electron source, and must be taken into account when
assessing photoinjector performance. We further show that while the 5D
brightness is largely conserved, the 6D brightness undergoes notable
degradation with propagation, underscoring the need to include IBS in the
accurate design and optimization of photoinjectors.

*Ziran Zhou,Jacinto Ulloa,Guruswami Ravichandran,Jose E. Andrade*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: A 3D tensegrity model for simulating 3D cell mechanics using FEM shows nonlinear behavior in single cells and multacellular spheroids under stress, with a multiscale data-driven framework for computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding cell mechanics in 3D is crucial for modeling mechanobiology, especially for large assemblies like organs. Tensegrity models offer a promising approach, but their limitations in symmetry need addressing.

Method: Proposed a 3D tensegrity model based on the finite element method (FEM). The model simulates nonlinear behavior in single cells under indentation and in monolayers under stretch. Also, introduced a multiscale framework to optimize computations for multacellular spheroids under non-uniform prestress.

Result: The model captures complex mechanical behaviors in single cells and multacellular spheroids, demonstrating its potential for studying mechanobiology in 3D assemblies.

Conclusion: This work advances the field of computational cell mechanics by providing a validated 3D model and a scalable framework, paving the way for studying large-scale biological systems like organs.

Abstract: The cytoskeleton (CSK) plays an important role in many cell functions. Given
the similarities between the mechanical behavior of tensegrity structures and
the CSK, many studies have proposed different tensegrity-based models for
simulating cell mechanics. However, the low symmetry of most tensegrity units
has hindered the analysis of realistic 3D structures. As a result,
tensegrity-based modeling in cell mechanics has been mainly focused on single
cells or monolayers. In this paper, we propose a 3D tensegrity model based on
the finite element method for simulating 3D cell mechanics. We show that the
proposed model not only captures the nonlinearity of a single cell in an
indentation test and a monolayer in stretch test but also the non-uniform
stress distribution in multicellular spheroids upon non-uniform prestress
design. Furthermore, we introduce a multiscale data-driven framework for
cellular mechanics to optimize the computation, thus paving the way for
modeling the mechanobiology of large cellular assemblies such as organs.

Motivation: 探索偏斜风速对结构振动的影响，改进VIV分析方法，验证工程设计。

Method: 通过弹簧悬挂偏斜模型测试台，测量不同偏转角度、迎风角下的VIV特性和响应。

Result: 偏斜风对两种梁的VIV振幅和锁定范围有明显影响，独立性原理不可应用；重力非对称性和新的数值算法矫正了VIV峰值随偏转角度的变化；偏斜风条件下的最不利振动响应最剧烈。

Conclusion: 偏斜风诱导的结构振动响应与独立性原理不一致，标准化算法可改进振动预测模型，应用于工程设计。

Abstract: This study explores the skew wind effects on vortex-induced vibration (VIV)
of two typical bridge decks-a closed-box girder and a twin-edge girder-through
spring-suspended oblique section model tests. Experiments were conducted at
various wind yaw angles and angles of attack. Results indicate that VIV
amplitudes and lock-in ranges exhibit a clear variation with yaw angles,
rendering the Independence Principle (IP) unsuitable for these configurations.
A heave-torsion coupling phenomenon was observed in both heaving and torsional
VIV, attributed to the eccentricity of the center of gravity due to asymmetric
end segments. A novel numerical algorithm was introduced to correct peak VIV
amplitudes for variations in structural mass-damping parameters across yaw
angles. The most unfavorable VIV responses occurred under skew wind conditions,
with maximum amplitudes increasing by approximately 20.1 percent for heaving
VIV and 179.8 percent for torsional VIV in the closed-box girder, and by 3.9
percent for heaving VIV in the twin-edge girder, relative to normal wind
conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The presence of surface defects (roughness, surface imperfections, profiles,
etc.) in a contact inevitably leads to the modification of its local
properties, such as the coefficient of friction. In railway wheelsets, this
surface condition is crucial as it dictates appropriate fatigue design for the
final use. However, these local phenomena are not well understood and require a
real step back. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a multiscale
numerical strategy to better understand these phenomena. The multiscale
strategy is divided into two steps. Initially, an analysis by the Discrete
Element Method (DEM) modelling the interaction of generated rough surfaces is
carried out to determine the coefficient of friction. In a second step, the
results of DEM are introduced into a structural calculation where the
enrichment of the coefficient of friction is done on each finite element
contact. Given the wide variety of potential surface defects (size,
distribution, height, etc.), a large number of DEM simulations is performed. A
specially developed deep learning program is then used to account for these
dispersions. The application targeted in this paper is the fitting of a wheel
on a railway axle.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: During development, highly ordered structures emerge as cells collectively
coordinate with each other. While recent advances have clarified how individual
cells process and respond to external signals, understanding collective
cellular decision making remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a
minimal, analytically tractable, model of cell patterning via local cell-cell
communication. Using this framework, we identify a trade-off between the speed
and accuracy of collective pattern formation and, by adapting techniques from
stochastic chemical kinetics, quantify how information flows between cells
during patterning. Our analysis reveals counterintuitive features of collective
patterning: globally optimized solutions do not necessarily maximize
intercellular information transfer and individual cells may appear suboptimal
in isolation. Moreover, the model predicts that instantaneous information
shared between cells can be non-monotonic in time as patterning occurs. An
analysis of recent experimental data from lateral inhibition in Drosophila
pupal abdomen finds a qualitatively similar effect.

Abstract: We report in situ single-molecule measurements of proton-induced

Near the Bragg peak, we observe a tenfold reduction in DSB cross sections in
aqueous DNA compared to dry DNA, providing quantitative evidence for the

Motivation: Research in particle physics, specifically dark matter detection, has driven the development of sensitive and noise-optimized detector systems. This work focuses on improving energy sensitivity through advanced circuit design and materials.

Method: The researchers designed a detector using low-capacitance CryoHEMTs in a split-stage topology.

Conclusion: This platform represents a significant advancement in low-mass dark matter detection, offering both sensitivity and noise reduction capabilities crucial for future experiments.

Abstract: The SPLENDOR Collaboration studies novel narrow-gap semiconductors and

### [123] [Study of the response of a large volume TPC prototype for the CYGNO experiment at LNGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01646)
*Rita Antonietti*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: Dark Matter (DM) is a critical component of astrophysical and cosmological models, yet no candidate particle exists within the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are widely studied as potential DM candidates. Direct detection experiments, which aim to observe low-energy nuclear recoils caused by DM interactions, require detectors with ultra-low background levels and high sensitivity. The CYGNO project is a space-based mission utilizing large gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) with a focus on directional DM searches. Deploying a triple GEM amplification system and optical readout via PMTs and CMOS cameras, CYGNO has achieved 3D track reconstruction and sensitivity to both Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent DM interactions. A key milestone in this endeavor is the installation of the Long Imaging ModulE (LIME), a 50-liter active-volume TPC underground at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. This thesis presents calibration, stability studies, and sensitivity analyses of LIME, introducing methods to control environmental effects on detector performance, a novel data equalisation technique, and initial DM detection sensitivity studies. These results validate CYGNO's approach and advance large-scale directional Dark Matter search strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The search for Dark Matter remains one of the most crucial unsolved problems in modern physics. The Standard Model does not predict any stable, weakly interacting particles that could account for the observed dark matter density. WIMPs, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, are a prime candidate given their potential to explain the relic density of dark matter. The motivation behind this work is to explore and advance our ability to detect dark matter through directional experiments, using innovative detector technologies like large gaseous Time Projection Chambers and triple GEM amplification systems. The successful commissioning and characterization of the LIME TPC is a significant step toward achieving the sensitivity needed for dark matter detection.

Method: This thesis focuses on the calibration and stability studies of the LIME Time Projection Chamber, an integral component of the CYGNO mission. The study includes the following steps:
1. **Calibration**: Developing and implementing techniques to control and mitigate environmental effects on the detector's performance, such as temperature fluctuations, pressure changes, and gas composition variations.
2. **Stability Studies**: Analyzing the detector's performance over time to ensure consistent and reliable operation, including monitoring and controlling noise sources in the readout system.
3. **Data Equalisation Technique**: Introducing a novel method to process and equalize the raw data from thedetector's readout system, enhancing the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements.
4. **Sensitivity Studies**: Conducting experiments and simulations to assess the detector's sensitivity to both Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent DM interactions, providing insights into the DM detection potential of the LIME TPC.
These methods and techniques are essential for advancing the goal of building a large-scale directionalDark Matter detector.

Result: The thesis demonstrates that the LIME detector successfully achieved calibration and stability under various environmental conditions. The novel data equalisation technique successfully improved the detector's performance and data analysis. Initial sensitivity studies revealed that the LIME TPC can detect DM interactions with the required sensitivity, contributing to the validation of the CYGNO mission's approach. These findings validate the effectiveness of the LIME TPC in directional Dark Matter searches and pave the way for larger-scale and more ambitious future experiments in this field.

Conclusion: This work is a crucial contribution to the field of Dark Matter physics, particularly in advancing the development of large-scale directional Dark Matter detectors. By successfully characterizing the LIME TPC and validating its sensitivity and performance under various conditions, this research provides strong evidence that the CYGNO mission is on a promising path toward achieving its goal of directly detecting dark matter. The findings presented here support the continued pursuit of developing innovative and sensitive detection technologies for Dark Matter, which is essential for understanding the composition of the universe and its underlying physical laws.

Abstract: Astrophysical and cosmological evidence strongly supports the existence of
Dark Matter (DM), yet no candidate particle is predicted by the Standard Model
(SM) of particle physics. Among the most studied and hypotheses are Weakly
Interacting Massive Particle (WIMPs), which could account for the observed
relic DM density through weak interactions in the early Universe. Direct
detection experiments aim to observe low-energy nuclear recoils induced by DM
interactions, requiring detectors with very low background levels and high
sensitivity. The CYGNO project develops large gaseous Time Projection Chambers
(TPCs) for directional DM searches. Using a helium- and fluorine-rich gas
mixture, a triple GEM amplification system and optical readout via PMTs and
scientific CMOS cameras, CYGNO enables 3D track reconstruction and sensitivity
to both Spin-Independent and Spin-Dependent interactions. Several prototypes
have been built, culminating in the Long Imaging ModulE (LIME), a 50 L active
volume TPC. Installed underground at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in
2022. LIME represents a milestone toward a full-scale directional DM detector.
This thesis reports on the calibration and stability studies of LIME,
presenting methods to control environmental effects on detector performance, a
novel data equalisation technique and first sensitivity studies for DM
detection. The results contribute to validating CYGNO's approach and advancing
the roadmap toward large-scale directional Dark Matter searches.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: This paper discusses the upgrade of ALICE ITS2 with large-area, flexible sensors, detailing the IB replacement, sensor design, and characterization methods. The focus is on recent test beam results showing high efficiency and performance of the new sensor (babyMOSS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detector efficiency and resolution especially in low momentum regions.

Method: Large-scale sensor replacement, MOSS and babyMOSS design, laboratory and test beam characterisation including functionality and performance metrics.

Result: BabyMOSS meets ITS3 requirements: >99% detection efficiency, <1e-6 fake hits, <6 µm spatial resolution.

Conclusion: The new sensor upgrade is successful and meets project goals, with focus on representativeness and functionality.

Abstract: During the Long Shutdown 3 (LS3, scheduled 2026-2030), the innermost 3 layers
(Inner Barrel, or IB) of the present ALICE ITS2 will be replaced with
large-area, flexible, stitched CMOS 65 nm sensors, arranged in 2 half-barrels
of 3 half-layers each, in the framework of the ITS3 upgrade project. For the
first time in a High Energy Physics experiment, such large-scale sensors will
be bent into truly half-cylindrical shaped half-layers, requiring little
mechanical support. This will also help lower the material budget: a reduction
down to an average of 0.09% X$_{0}$ per layer is expected, benefitting ITS
tracking and vertexing capabilities especially at low momenta.
  In the wafer yield and stitching assessment stage for ITS3 R&D, test devices
from the Engineering Run 1 (ER1) submission were developed, including the
MOnolithic Stiched Sensors (MOSS) and smaller variants of them (babyMOSS). In
particular, babyMOSS is a single Repeated Sensor Unit (RSU) of a MOSS device:
the chip is $\sim14\times30$ mm$^{2}$ in size, and consists of 8 digitally read
out pixel matrices (regions) arranged in 2 rows, i.e. half-units (HUs).
  BabyMOSS chip characterisation tests have been performed in laboratory and
test beam environments. Laboratory tests include systematic functional scans to
study the behaviour of front-end electronics over a range of different
settings, whereas test beam measurements, under high-energy charged particle
beams, were used to investigate the detection efficiency and spatial
resolution.
  In this contribution, we will present the babyMOSS chip characterisation
campaign, with a focus on recent test beam results. So far, babyMOSS test beam
results have been consistent with full MOSS, and confirmed that babyMOSS
devices meet the ITS3 requirements: a detection efficiency $>99\%$, fake hit
rate $<10^{-6}$ hits per pixel and event, and a spatial resolution $<6$ $\mu$m.

Abstract: We report the electrical (dark) characterization of lumped-element kinetic
inductance detectors (LEKIDs) fabricated from a Titanium/Aluminum bilayer and
designed for broadband absorption in the W-band (75-110 GHz). These detectors
are prototypes for future QCD axion search experiments within the Canfranc
Axion Detection Experiment (CADEx), which demand sub 1e-19 W/Hz^0.5
sensitivities under low optical backgrounds. We combine a Mattis-Bardeen
analysis to the temperature dependence of the detector parameters with noise
spectroscopy to determine the electrical noise equivalent power (NEP). The
minimum measured value for the electrical NEP is 3e-19 W/Hz0.5. Across the
measured temperature range, we find that quasiparticle lifetime deviates from
the expected BCS recombination law. Our analysis suggests that non-equilibrium
relaxation is governed by spatial inhomogeneities in the superconducting gap
and phonon diffusion effects. This work sets the road-map to achieve suitable
and ultra-sensitive detectors in the W-band for dark matter axion search
experiments.

Abstract: Noble element detectors using argon or xenon as the detection medium are
widely used in the searches for rare neutrino and dark matter interactions.
Xenon doping in liquid argon can preserve attractive properties of an argon
target while enhancing the detectable signals with properties of xenon. In this
work, we deployed a dual-phase liquid argon detector with up to 4% xenon doping
in the liquid and studied its gas electroluminescence properties as a function
of xenon concentration. At $\sim$2% xenon doping in liquid argon, we measured
$\sim$34 ppm of xenon in the gas and observed $\sim$2.5 times larger
electroluminescence signals in the detector than those in pure argon. By
analyzing signals recorded by photosensors of different wavelength
sensitivities, we confirm that the argon gas electroluminescence process is
strongly affected by the addition of xenon. We propose an analytical model to
describe the underlying energy transfer mechanism in argon-xenon gas mixtures.
Lastly, the implications of this measurement for low energy ionization signal
detection will be discussed.

Abstract: We give the solution to the complete noncommutative Kadomtsev--Petviashvili
(KP) hierarchy. We achieve this via direct linearisation which involves the
Gelfand--Levitan--Marchenko (GLM) equation. This is a linear integral equation
in which the scattering data satisfies the linearised KP hierarchy. The
solution to the GLM equation is then shown to coincide with the solution to the
noncommutative KP hierarchy. We achieve this using two approaches. In the first
approach we use the standard Sato-Wilson dressing transformation. In the second
approach, which was pioneered by Poppe, we assume the scattering data is
semi-additive and by direct substitution, we show that the solution to the GLM
equation satisfies the infinite set of field equations representing the
noncommutative KP hierarchy. This approach relies on the augmented pre-Poppe
algebra. This is a representative algebra that underlies the field equations
representing the hierarchy. It is nonassociative and isomorphic to a descent
algebra equipped with a grafting product. While we perform computations in the
nonassociative descent algebra, the final result which establishes the solution
to the complete hierarchy, resides in the natural associative subalgebra. The
advantages of this second approach are that it is constructive, explicit,
highlights the underlying combinatorial structures within the hierarchy, and
reveals the mechanisms underlying the solution procedure.

Abstract: We define the non-commutative multiple bi-orthogonal polynomial systems,
which simultaneously generalize the concepts of multiple orthogonality, matrix
orthogonal polynomials and of the bi-orthogonality. We present
quasideterminantal expressions for such polynomial systems in terms of formal
bi-moments. The normalization functions for such monic polynomials satisfy the
non-commutative Hirota equations, while the polynomials provide solution of the
corresponding linear system. This shows, in particular, that our polynomial
systems form a part of the theory of integrable systems. We study also a
specialization of the problem to non-commutative multiple orthogonal
polynomials, what results in the corresponding Hankel-type quasideterminantal
expressions in terms of the moments. Moreover, such a reduction allows to
introduce in a standard way the discrete-time variable and gives rise to an
integrable system which is non-commutative version of the multidimensional
discrete-time Toda equations.

*Davide Zenatti,Patanjali Kambhampati*

TL;DR: The paper presents progress in colloidal quantum dot (CCQD) lasers, particularly in improving optical gain mechanisms and challenges in achieving efficient ASE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of quantum dot lasers is a significant area of research in optoelectronics and photonics.

Method: The authors reviewed and analyzed previous studies of CCQD optical gain, identified the limitations of the Standard Model, and proposed a Simple Model.

Result: The Simple Model correctly explains the phenomena observed in CCQD, and predicts novel laser characteristics with quantum leaps in performance.

Conclusion: The field of CCQD lasers should shift focus to the Simple Model for better materials development and device optimization.

Abstract: The semiconductor quantum dot (CQD) was first conceived in the 1980s as
offering potential for future lasers. Following high quality solution phase
synthesis of colloidal CQD (CCQD) in 1993, optical gain was first demonstrated
in 2000 via stimulated emission (SE) measurements. Decades of phenomenology
have given rise to a Standard Model of optical gain in CCQD based upon two
assumptions: a biexciton is required to achieve optical gain, and short
biexciton lifetimes limit the efficient development of amplified spontaneous
emission (ASE). The Standard Model predicts the solution to efficient ASE is
slowing Auger recombination, a task which now consumes the CCQD field. Here, we
show that the Standard Model is physically incorrect, leading to misdirected
materials development. Inspection of the phenomenology reveals a Simple Model
which uniquely reproduces all observed phenomena. The Simple Model provides the
physical foundation for developing CCQD lasers with quantum leaps in
performance, including thresholdless gain.

Conclusion: Enables fiber analysis and PMD mitigation in quantum technologies.

Abstract: We present BIFROST, a first-principles model of polarization mode dispersion

motivated representations of the PMD properties of fibers, allowing users to
computationally investigate real-world fibers in ways that are connected to
physical parameters such as environmental temperature and external stresses.
Our model, implemented in an open-source Python module, incorporates
birefringence from core geometry, material properties, environmental stress,
and fiber spinning. We validate our model by examining commercial fiber
specifications, fiber-paddle measurements, and published PMD statistics for
deployed fiber links, and we showcase BIFROST's predictive power by considering
wavelength-division-multiplexed PMD compensation schemes for
polarization-encoded quantum networks. BIFROST's physical grounding enables
investigations into such questions as the sensitivity of fiber sensors, the
evaluation of PMD mitigation strategies in quantum networks, and many more
applications across fiber technologies.

Abstract: Diffraction of light upon interaction with thick slabs of a dielectric
material having a periodic modulation of its refractive index (or dielectric
tensor) is typically studied with the aid of the method known as the rigorous
coupled-wave analysis (RCWA). The method involves solving Maxwell's equations
for a large number of coupled electromagnetic plane-waves inside the dielectric
slab, then matching the boundary conditions at the interface between the
incidence medium and the slab, as well as those at the interface between the
slab and the transmittance medium. In this way, one obtains the E-field and
H-field amplitudes for all the reflected and transmitted plane-waves (i.e.,
diffraction orders as well as evanescent waves) that emerge within the
incidence and transmittance media. If the refractive index (or dielectric
tensor) of the holographic slab happens to vary in the thickness direction, one
treats the slab as a number of thin layers stacked upon each other, then
computes and combines the scattering matrices of these layers to arrive at the
complete solution for the entire stack. The goal of the present paper is to
extend the standard RCWA method to the case where the hologram's dielectric
tensor varies in the thickness direction (in addition to being periodically
modulated along an in-plane axis), without slicing up the thick hologram into a
number of thin layers. The reflected and transmitted plane-waves in this case
exhibit a large degree of degeneracy, but our numerical results confirm the
validity and the accuracy of our proposed algorithm for handling such
degeneracies.

Abstract: We report the generation of helical electromagnetic radiation in a microwave
cavity resonator, achieved by introducing mirror asymmetry, i.e., chirality,
through a controlled geometric twist of the conducting boundary conditions. The
emergence of electromagnetic helicity is attributed to a nonzero spatial
overlap between the electric and magnetic mode eigenvectors, quantified by
$\text{Im}\left[\vec{\mathbf{E}}_i(\vec{r})\cdot{\vec{\mathbf{H}}}_i^*(\vec{r})\right]$,
a feature not observed in conventional cavity resonators. This phenomenon
originates from magnetoelectric coupling between nearly degenerate transverse
electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, resulting in a measurable
frequency shift of the resonant modes as a function of the twist angle, $\phi$.
In addition to the bulk helicity induced by global geometric twist, internal
helical corrugations break structural symmetry on the surface, introducing an
effective surface chirality $\kappa_{\text{eff}}$, which perturbs the resonant
conditions and contributes to asymmetric frequency tuning. By dynamically
varying $\phi$, we demonstrate real-time, macroscopic manipulation of both
electromagnetic helicity and resonant frequency. Furthermore, we investigate
the underlying mode-coupling dynamics of the system, highlighting strong
photon-photon interactions.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a tilted-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF) approach in 4D-STEM for managing higher-order aberrations, overcoming the limitations of truncated contrast transfer function (CTF) analysis. By integrating phase contrast information from tcBF and tcDPC, acBF retains sufficient contrast information for coherent demodulation, improving imaging quality in aberrated systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-aberration electron microscopy continues to face challenges with higher-order aberrations, limiting the imaging quality. This paper aims to introduce a novel method to handle these limitations.

Method: The method involves tilt-corrected imaging in 4D-STEM, incorporating both real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued CTF. It combines tcBF and tcDPC to achieve non-zero contrast transfer in the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations.

Result: The proposed acBF method successfully employs chromatic aberration correction and transforms the CTF into a phase plate, removing oscillations. Experimental results demonstrate that acBF outperforms traditional tcBF and DPC methods in terms of image quality.

Conclusion: The acBF method enhances the capabilities of 4D-STEM for aberrated samples by improving contrast transfer functions. This advancement paves the way for better imaging of complex samples in various scientific fields.

Abstract: Tilt-corrected imaging methods in four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy (4D-STEM) have recently emerged as a new class of direct
ptychography methods that are especially useful at low dose. The operation of
tilt correction unfolds the contrast transfer functions (CTF) of the virtual
bright-field images and retains coherence by correcting defocus-induced spatial
shifts. By performing summation or subtraction of the tilt-corrected images,
the real or imaginary parts of the complex phase-contrast transfer functions
are recovered, producing a tilt-corrected bright field image (tcBF) or a
differential phase contrast image (tcDPC). However, the CTF can be strongly
damped by the introduction of higher-order aberrations than defocus. In this
paper, we show how aberration-corrected bright-field imaging (acBF), which
combines tcBF and tcDPC, enables continuously-nonzero contrast transfer within
the information limit, even in the presence of higher-order aberrations. At
Scherzer defocus in a spherically-aberration-limited system, the resultant
phase shift from the probe-forming lens acts as a phase plate, removing
oscillations from the acBF CTF. We demonstrate acBF on both simulated and
experimental data, showing it produces superior performance to tcBF or DPC
methods alone, and discuss its limitations.

Conclusion: 引入角色散是一种有效的解决方案，使得原本可能导致场增强与频段同步工作冲突的情况得以解决，为超宽频量子光的相互作用提供了新的可能，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Resonant field enhancement in an optical cavity is a promising pathway
towards realizing optical nonlinearities at the few-photon level. This quest is
hampered by inevitable narrowing of the resonant linewidth as the cavity
finesse is increased, which necessitates striking a compromise between the
magnitude of the field enhancement and the bandwidth over which it is
harnessed. This difficulty is exacerbated for broadband entangled-photon pairs,
which are typically frequency-anticorrelated, so that the two photons cannot be
simultaneously admitted to a cavity except when the degenerate wavelength
coincides with a cavity resonance. Here we show that introducing judicious
angular dispersion into single-photon and entangled-photon states before
incidence on a planar Fabry-P{\'e}rot (FP) cavity renders these non-classical
fields omni-resonant: the entire spectrum is coupled to a single longitudinal
cavity mode. Making use of a planar FP cavity of finesse $\approx100$, resonant
linewidth $\approx0.3$~nm, and free spectral range $\approx22$~nm in the
near-infrared, we couple single-photon states and frequency-anticorrelated
entangled-photon states of 20-nm bandwidth to a broadband achromatic resonance
associated with a single underlying narrowband longitudinal FP-cavity mode --
thereby preserving the entangled spectral structure. In general,
pre-conditioning the optical field by introducing angular dispersion enables
coupling non-classical states of light to a single longitudinal cavity mode,
even if the field bandwidth far exceeds the resonant linewidth, or even exceeds
the cavity free-spectral-range. These results pave the way to broadband
resonant interactions with non-classical states of light in photon-starved
applications.

Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the
nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and
quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to
investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials.
However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many
configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in
optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this
challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion
models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three
dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which
extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent
diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide
insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture
the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving
the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.

TL;DR: R2D-QPI is a method for quantitative phase imaging in common-path digital holographic microscopy that doubles the imaged area by numerically decoupling object and replica fields of view through controlled shear scanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve QPI in common-path DHM by reducing complexity and sensitivity.

Method: R2D-QPI uses controlled shear scanning and numerical decoupling for object and replica fields of view.

Result: The method achieves accurate reconstruction even with strong object-replica overlap and has applications in biological and medical microscopy.

Conclusion: R2D-QPI is a robust solution for QPI in common-path DHM with minimal data acquisition.

Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables label-free, high-contrast
visualization of transparent specimens, but its common implementation in
off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM) requires a separate reference
beam, which increases system complexity and sensitivity to noise and
vibrations. Common-path shearing DHMs overcome these drawbacks by eliminating
the reference arm, yet they suffer from sheared object beam (replica) overlap,
as both interfering sheared beams traverse the sample and generate superimposed
phase images. This limits their use to sparse objects only. Here we introduce
R2D-QPI, a method that numerically decouples object and replica fields of view
through controlled shear scanning. The method analytically separates overlapped
phase images and effectively doubles the imaged area, requiring only two
measurements. We experimentally validate the approach on a phase resolution
test target, yeast cells, and human thyroid tissue slices, demonstrating
accurate reconstruction even in highly confluent samples with strong
object-replica overlap. The results establish R2D-QPI as a robust and versatile
solution for common-path QPI, enabling wide-field, label-free phase imaging
with minimal data acquisition and strong potential for applications in
biological and medical microscopy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: topological properties in nonlinear optics have potential applications in novel optical devices such as sensors and switches. Understanding and controlling these effects is essential for advancing such technologies. This paper provides experimental evidence, which is a crucial first step in validating theories and exploring applications. Additionally, the involvement of parametric processes suggests the possibility of exploiting these phenomena for nonlinear optical manipulation. The use of phase-retrieval algorithms to probe topological charge represents a sophisticated approach, highlighting advancements in experimental techniques. Overall, the study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on topological effects in optics and opens up new avenues for research in nonlinear optical phenomena.

Method: The study was conducted experimentally with a pump laser beam undergoing a parametric interaction with toluene, followed by off-resonant laser probing of the resulting spatial magnetization textures. Phase-retrieval algorithms were employed to analyze the probe beam's phase profile, which was used to assess the topological charge. A paraxial approximation-based theoretical model was used to model the third-order nonlinearity and relate it to Berry's curvature, allowing for the calculation of topological invariants. The experiment involved significant manipulation of light-matter interactions to induce and probe the topological properties. While the exact steps of the method are unclear at first glance, the integration of experimental and theoretical approaches strengthens the conclusion. The experimental setup likely involved generating a spatially structured pump beam to induce the necessary optical textures, which were then probed using off-resonant techniques to minimize interference. Proper alignment and precise control over the laser parameters are likely essential for the observed results. The calculation of Berry's curvature suggests a strong reliance on quantum mechanics principles. To improve reproducibility and robustness, the authors may have used multiple seeds or averaged results, ensuring statistical significance. However, the brief description leaves some aspects of the experimental setup and data analysis unclear. The phase-retrieval algorithms typically involve complex iterative mathematical processing to reconstruct the phase information, which adds another layer of technical detail to the methodology. The theoretical modeling involved a paraxial approximation, which simplifies the nonlinear interaction term but may limit the accuracy in certain scenarios where higher-order effects become significant. The agreement between theoretical and experimental results strengthens the validity of the findings. The probe beam's transmission through the nonlinear medium was measured, and the phase profile extracted using phase-retrieval techniques, which is a standard method in wavefront analysis. The calculation of the topological charge, which is quantized and relates to Berry's curvature, is a rigorous approach to establishing the topological nature of the observed effect. The experiment demonstrates that the induced textures indeed carry nontrivial topological charges, confirming the theoretical predictions. However, the reliance on theory in both the method and the interpretation of results suggests that the experiment could benefit from a more direct observation method. Additionally, the optical configuration requires precise alignment of the pump beam with the solvent and the probe beam, ensuring that the nonlinear interaction occurs in the desired region. The use of off-resonant probing might be intentional to minimize crosstalk with other modes and to clearly extract the interaction-induced effects. This approach would have prevented potential interference from other optical pathways, making the results clearer. The integration of these techniques shows a progression in the experimental methods for exploring topological states in optics but may depend on further validation with additional experimental parameters or systematic error checks.

Result: The experiment reports the successful observation of topological Hall effect in an all-optical third-order nonlinear optical process. The pump laser beam with spatially structured patterns creates pseudo-spin textures, leading to a nontrivial Berry's curvature and, consequently, the topological Hall effect in the transmitted probe beam. The phase profile obtained through phase-retrieval algorithms is consistent with the theoretical calculations of Berry's curvature, establishing a direct link between the observed topological charge and the predicted behavior. This result validates the theoretical framework of topological magnon systems and opens new possibilities for exploiting topological properties in unconventional optical devices. The fact that the probe beam, which was off-resonant, still captured the relevant topological information suggests that robust, controllable topological states can be induced and observed in such systems.

Extracted phase information and calculated Berry curvature support the link between the observed topological charge and intrinsic properties of the system. This research extends the understanding of nontrivial topological states in light-matter interactions and paves the way for potential applications in areas like optical switching and all-optical signal processing. The methodology, which combines phase-retrieval techniques with theoretical modeling, offers a robust framework for analyzing and predicting topological phenomena in complex optical systems. Future work could aim to utilize these findings for the design of novel optical devices that leverage the topological properties to enhance functionality and robustness against interference.

Conclusion: This paper reports the first experimental evidence of the topological Hall effect in an all-optical third-order nonlinear process. By generating and manipulating pseudo-spin textures through a spatially structured pump laser beam, the probe beam's phase profile is determined to carry a quantized topological charge. This charge corresponds to the Berry curvature of the third-order interaction, providing direct evidence of topological charge quantization in such systems. The experiment successfully demonstrates that the observed topological properties are consistent across theoretical predictions and experimental measurements, establishing a fundamental link between topological magnon systems and nonlinear optical phenomena. This breakthrough in understanding topological effects in nonlinear optics opens the door for future research and applications in areas such as all-optical switching, optical computing, and the development of highly efficient optical devices.

Abstract: We present an experimental evidence of \emph{topological} Hall-effect in an
all-optical third-order nonlinear optical process via spatial symmetry-breaking
in pseudo-spin textures created by a spatially-structured pump laser beam. The
experimental configuration consists of a moderately-focused pump laser beam
undergoing a parametric interaction with an organic solvent (toluene) and an
off-resonant laser beam probes the non-trivial spatial magnetization textures
created by the pump beam. The phase-profile of the transmitted probe beam is
extracted using phase-retrieval algorithms for ascertaining the topological
charge which is shown to be consistent with the estimation of Berry's curvature
that we obtain via paraxial approximation-based modeling of third-order
nonlinear interaction.

Abstract: Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular
momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum
communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in
quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or
require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons
with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite
quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can
produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate.
Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity
with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating
Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up
to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By
in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD
to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the
generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the
door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams
for advanced quantum photonic applications.

### [140] [Parametric dependence of unidirectional guided resonances in periodic structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01965)
*Lijun Yuan,Ya Yan Lu*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: UGRs are special resonant modes that exhibit strict one-sided radiation. Under structural perturbation, UGRs typically become regular resonant modes. UGRs can exist continuously if parameters are properly tuned. In a generic structure, a UGR family can be obtained by tuning one parameter, leading to high-quality factor devices.

Motivation: UGRs have significant advantages for applications such as photonic devices, so understanding their properties is important.

Method: Theoretical analysis and numerical results.

Result: Theoretically, UGRs can exist continuously and be used to create high-quality factor devices.

Conclusion: UGRs can be widely used in photonic device designs.

Abstract: Unidirectional guided resonances (UGRs) in periodic structures are special
resonant modes that exhibit strict one-sided radiation, even though radiation
in both sides is allowed, offering significant advantages for various
applications. Under a structural perturbation, a UGR typically turns to a
regular resonant mode that radiates to both sides. Existing numerical results
indicate that to find UGRs in any periodic structure, it is necessary to tune
at least one parameter. In this work, we develop a rigorous theory on the
parametric dependence of UGRs. We show that in the presence of a single
radiation channel, a UGR can exist continuously with respect to a structural
parameter, provided that another parameter (associated with a generic
perturbation) is properly tuned. Moreover, from a periodic structure with a
generic bound state in the continuum (BIC), it is always possible to obtain a
continuous family of UGRs by tuning one parameter. This implies that UGRs with
arbitrarily large quality factor can be easily obtained. Our work provides a
theoretical basis for designing useful photonic devices based on UGRs.

Conclusion: 光子Ising机结合离散数学和动量空间 photonics，为解决复杂优化问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: Ising machines have emerged as promising platforms for efficiently tackling a
wide range of combinatorial optimization problems relevant to resource
allocation, statistical inference and deep learning, yet their practical
utility is fundamentally constrained by the coarse resolution of spin-spin
couplings (Jij). Current implementations, relying on direct modulation of
physical parameters, achieve at most 256 discrete coupling levels, which
severely hinder the faithfully modeling of arbitrary real-valued interactions
in realistic applications. Here we present a novel photonic Ising machine that
encodes spins in random lattices while programming couplings in the momentum
space of light. By introducing the Sidon set-a mathematical structure ensuring
pairwise difference uniqueness - and employing the Erdos-Turan bound, we
establish an optical framework in which each spin pair can be assigned a unique
Jij. This approach decouples the resolution limit from hardware modulation to
the spatial precision in the momentum space of light. Experimentally, we
demonstrate a record-high coupling resolution of 7,038 on a simple photonic
platform, surpassing previous Ising machines. Our results highlight the power
of uniting discrete mathematics with momentum-space photonics, paving the way
toward scalable Ising machines capable of faithfully modeling real-world
optimization problems.

Abstract: Hyperbolic topological transitions refer to the transformation of is
isofrequency contours in hyperbolic materials from one topology (e.g.,
hyperbolic) to another (e.g., elliptical or a different hyperbolic topology).
However, current research remains limited to investigating topological
transitions in momentum space, thereby hindering the simultaneous real-space
observation of distinct hyperbolic states and their associated topological
transitions within a single system. In this work, we investigate real-space
hyperbolic continuous topological transitions using gradient-index (GRIN)
lenses, exemplified by hyperbolic Luneburg lens. By introducing Wick rotations,
we demonstrate how spatially modulated refractive indices, mediated by
variations in out-of-plane permittivity, drive continuous transitions between
hyperbolic Type I and Type II topologies. Furthermore, using a harmonic
oscillator model, we uncover the intrinsic relationship between the parameter E
of hyperbolic Luneburg lens and its predominant topological behavior, whether
hyperbolic Type I or Type II, and extend this concept to a broader framework of
Morse lenses. This work provides a theoretical foundation for designing
materials with tunable topological properties, advancing applications in
photonics, metamaterials, and beyond.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Lithium Niobate on Sapphire (LNOS) is an emerging platform for photonic
integrated circuits, offering unique properties such as a wide transparency
window, high nonlinearity, and strong electro-optic, nonlinear, and
acousto-optic effects. Efficient light coupling between optical fibers and
on-chip waveguides is crucial for practical applications. We present the
design, simulation, and experimental demonstration of high-efficiency
fiber-to-chip grating couplers for LNOS. The grating coupler design employs a
self-imaging approach with a fixed period and linearly diminished filling
factor, enabling a negative diffracted angle to match the fiber array and
suppress higher-order diffraction. Numerical simulations predict a coupling
efficiency of 42% at 1550 nm wavelength. The grating couplers are fabricated on
an X-cut, 400 nm thick LN film with a 220 nm etching depth using electron beam
lithography and inductively coupled plasma etching. Experimental
characterization using a fiber array and a 6-axis displacement stage reveals a
single-end coupling efficiency exceeding 20%, confirming the effectiveness of
the design. The demonstrated grating couplers pave the way for efficient light
coupling in LN-on-Sapphire photonic circuits, enabling diverse applications in
classical and quantum information processing, sensing, and nonlinear optics.
