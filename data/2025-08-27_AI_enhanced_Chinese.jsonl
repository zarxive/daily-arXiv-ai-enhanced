Leading textbooks\nand research articles recognize that there are serious issues but ignore them\ndue to the lack of an approach that can regularize these divergences. We find a\nsolution to this difficulty by proposing a general method, called the weighted\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory, to handle multiple decomposition channels\noriginating from the same interaction. We distribute the interaction in\nweighted channels determined by minimization of the action, and we apply this\nidea to unpolarized Fermi superfluids. Using our method, we solve a\nlong-standing difficulty in the partitioning of the interaction into Hartree,\nFock, and Bogoliubov channels for Fermi superfluids, and we obtain a phase\ndiagram at the saddle-point level, which contains multichannel nonperturbative\ncorrections. In particular, we find a previously overlooked superfluid phase\nfor weak interactions, which is dominated by particle-hole processes, in\naddition to the usual superfluid phase only containing particle-particle\nphysics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6563\u5c04\u957f\u5ea6\u53d1\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u54c8 Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov \u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u5206\u89e3\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u7531\u7c92\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u6563\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8d85\u6d41\u76f8\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6563\u5c04\u957f\u5ea6\u53d1\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u80fd\u9699\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u52bf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u52a0\u6743 Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov \u7406\u8bba\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u6e20\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u6781\u5316\u8d39\u7c73\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7531\u7c92\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u6563\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8d85\u6d41\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7684\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u4fee\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u56fe\u7684\u7ed8\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u76f8\u56fe\u548c\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u591a\u5206\u89e3\u5904\u7406\u548c\u975e\u5fae\u6270\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

This leads to a parity-based\nseparation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly\nthan even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists\nin isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not\nproceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates\nof even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\\sim T^2$\nlow-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with\nodd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of\ninteractions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity\nrelaxation rates as large as $40\\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong\nadditional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even\nstaggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle\nscattering.

We propose a general symmetry-based strategy\nfor realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric\nmonolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an\nin-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting\noriginates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling,\nand is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit\ntime-reversal symmetry being broken.

Coherent\ncontrol of quantum interference enables switching of the probe field between\ntransparency and gain regimes. Subsequent analysis focuses on how the\nintroduction of gain in the probe transition lowers the threshold for optical\nbistability, thereby enhancing the nonlinear response of the system at reduced\ninput intensities. A detailed analysis of optical bistability is presented,\nfocusing on its threshold, stability, and switching efficiency as functions of\nfield strengths and detunings. Structured light beams, specifically Laguerre\nGaussian modes carrying orbital angular momentum, are employed to tailor the\nbistable characteristics.

Recent breakthroughs, such\nas the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential\nfor quantum applications at scale.

Here we establish a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only\nglobal pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators\nis, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and\nbosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical\nsuperlattices.

To solve this, we apply\nDinkelbach's method to handle the fractional objective and the inner\napproximation technique to iteratively convexify and solve the problem.\nSimulation results show that our approach consistently outperforms regularized\nzero-forcing in terms of EE, particularly in large-scale deployments,\ndemonstrating its potential for next-generation sustainable dense OWC networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\uff0cVCSEL\u9635\u5217\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u5e26\u6765\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u7684VCSEL\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u5e7f\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u524d\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Dinkelbach\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6570\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u8fed\u4ee3\u51f8\u5316\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u96f6\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77406G\u548c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u6c42 grows\uff0c\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08OWC\uff09\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002VCSEL\u9635\u5217\u7684 advances \u5728\u63d0\u9ad8 OWC \u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 \u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u529f\u7387\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684 VCSEL \u90e8\u7f72\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u6548\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u524d\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u7684 VCSEL \u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u5e7f\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Dinkelbach \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u524d\u5411\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u6548\u3002Dinkelbach \u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6570\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u51f8\u5316\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5149\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u96f6\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u7684 VCSEL \u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u5e7f\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u524d\u5411\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7 Dinkelbach \u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

This unified perspective\noffers new insights into the mathematical and physical properties of\nentanglement in structured quantum systems, like the connection of the PPT\ncriterion to experimentally accessible entanglement witnesses, thus opening a\npath for extending the group formalism to more complex quantum systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u7684PPT\u548c\u91cd\u6392\u51c6\u5219\u662f\u4ece\u7fa4\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7fa4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5224\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7fa4\u8bba\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7ea0\u7f20\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u7fa4\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8d1d\u5c14\u6001\u7684PPT\u548c\u91cd\u6392\u51c6\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u68c0\u9a8c\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7fa4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3aPPT\u548c\u91cd\u6392\u51c6\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PPT\u5224\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u68c0\u9a8c\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7fa4\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ea0\u7f20\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Among these quantum\nphenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice\nstructure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs\nlower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates\nbehaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum\ncorrelated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW\ntransition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by\nthe sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is\nthe lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure\nchanges associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of\nelectron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric\nmeasurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a\nCDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing\ndemonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced\ndisorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst\neffect due to the CDW.

However, global symmetries cannot be expected\nto be protected at the fundamental level. Finding consistent ultra-violet\ncompletions for axions is therefore a necessity. In this work, we identify the\naxion with the position mode of a charged 3-brane in (4+1)-dimensions. The\nshift symmetry of the axion is then a residual diffeomorphism in the fifth\ndimension orthogonal to the brane. Meanwhile, the brane is coupled to a flux in\nthe fifth dimension. From the (3+1)-dimensional perspective, this construction\ngenerates a mass for the axion and matches previously known proposals in the\nliterature based on the coupling between the axion and a three-form gauge\nfield. In a second step, we uplift this (4+1)-dimensional model to M-theory,\nwhere the same three-form is found to couple to the membrane with a\n(2+1)-dimensional worldvolume.

Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic\npolarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical\npumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand\npreparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e.,\nelectrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable\nferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With\nincreased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of\nferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature.\nBoth optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective\nnear CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of\nphoto-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically\nswitched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved\nmeasurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a\nCI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological\nquantum many-body system with potential applications in topological\nspintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by\nprogrammable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper showcases the use of optical control to manipulate the topology of zero-field fractional Chern insulators, specifically twisted MoTe\u2082 bilayers, by controlling ferromagnetic polarization, enabling switches between integer and fractional quantum Hall states.", "motivation": "The study aims to harness optical methods for precise control of topological states in materials, with potential applications in quantum spintronics, memory devices, and exotic quantum states.", "method": "The researchers used circularly polarized optical pumping to manipulate the ferromagnetic polarization of twisted MoTe\u2082 bilayers at different optical excitation powers, achieving control through electrically tuned state transitions and helicity selective pumping.", "result": "The system demonstrated on-demand ferromagnetic state preparation and direct optical switching of polarization, linked to gap-enhanced valley polarization, enabling spatially resolvable manipulation of topological order.", "conclusion": "This work paves the way for optical control of topological many-body systems, offering new avenues for quantum device engineering and topological state manipulation."}}

By modeling neural activations and weights as fermionic matter and gauge fields, the authors create a new paradigm for analyzing and designing neural networks. The successful validation of the theoretical framework through numerical Simulations of multilayer perceptrons highlights the feasibility and potential impact of this approach. The introduction of a gauge-invariant neural network architecture further reinforces the practical relevance of the work. Additionally, the development of a double-copy replica method for unifying computations in stochastic QED and wide DNNs provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of neural Networks.

In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a\nstationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to\nthe active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage\nfluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and\nsemiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the\ninduced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By\ncontrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator\ntransition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite\ndrag voltage emerges.

In this letter, we\nintroduce a methodology to quantitatively determine the multipole moment\ncontributions in anomalous Hall effect through angle-dependent anomalous Hall\ncurrent, with explicit incorporation of discrete crystal symmetries. Our\ntechnique uniquely enables the investigation of octupole contribution in\nnon-periodic systems, particularly at interfaces and surfaces. Typically, in\n(Ag$_{2}$Fe$_{5}$)$_{n}$ multilayers with quantum-well-engineered $k$-point\nselectivity, we observe an octupole-dominated anomalous Hall effect in\nconventional ferromagnetic materials, through first-principles calculations.\nThese results fundamentally challenge the existing theoretical understanding of\nthe anomalous Hall effect, showing that even the conventional contribution\narises not only from the dipole moment (net magnetization).

Using three complementary numerical techniques -- the WKB method\nwith Pad\\'e resummation, time-domain integration, and the Frobenius (Leaver)\nmethod -- we obtain accurate spectra of quasinormal frequencies. Our analysis\nshows that increasing the scalar-field mass leads to arbitrarily long-lived\nstates, known as quasi-resonances, a behavior shared by both the fundamental\nmode and the first overtone. The real part of the quasinormal mode decreases\nfor the first and higher overtones and starting from the second overtone it\nreaches zero at some critical value of mass of the field. When the effective\npotential develops an additional peak, the late-time signal exhibits a sequence\nof echoes.

The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is\nobeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal\nsegments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced\nfour-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude\nbut opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this\nresult as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start\nby assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting\nparticles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a\nhypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time\ncoordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection\nacross the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles\nrecover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper\ncoordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting\npositive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null\nspacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal\nsegments.

It uses\nquantum-assisted Column Generation (CG) based on Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms\n(QAA) to sample high-quality maximum-weight independent sets (MWIS), reducing\nthe need to repeatedly solve NP-hard PSPs. The adapted branching strategy\nleverages quantum-generated independent sets to explore fewer nodes, tighten\nlower bounds, and converge faster.

Current monolithic device architectures have scaling limits beyond\nfew tens of logical qubits. To scale up, we require architectures that\norchestrate several monolithic devices into a distributed quantum computing\nsystem. Currently, resource estimation, which is crucial for determining\nhardware needs and bottlenecks, focuses exclusively on monolithic systems. Our\nwork fills this gap and answers key architectural design questions about\ndistributed systems, including the impact of distribution on application\nresource needs, the organization of qubits across nodes and the requirements of\nentanglement distillation (quantum network). To answer these questions, we\ndevelop a novel resource estimation framework that models the key components of\nthe distributed execution stack. We analyse the performance of practical\nquantum algorithms on various hardware configurations, spanning different qubit\nspeeds, entanglement generation rates and distillation protocols. We show that\ndistributed architectures have practically feasible resource requirements; for\na node size of 45K qubits, distributed systems need on average 1.4X higher\nnumber of physical qubits and 4X higher execution time compared to monolithic\narchitectures, but with more favourable hardware implementation prospects.
