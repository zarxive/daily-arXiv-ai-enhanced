Abstract: State-of-the-art additive manufacturing technologies are not only finding
ever-wider applications in everyday life, but also assuming an increasingly
important role in scientific research. This kind of advanced manufacturing
method eliminates many of the constraints of conventional processes in
fabricating components with complex external shapes or intricate internal
structures, thereby providing enhanced flexibility for the design and
realization of a new generation of more efficient particle accelerators and
storage rings. The RACERS team initiated by the Stochastic Cooling Group at
GSI, Germany, is worldwide one of the first teams working on this topic. Based
on the metal 3D-printing technology, two novel accelerating structures and one
efficient cooling plate for a future stochastic cooling system are under
development at GSI and for the FAIR project, respectively. Some successful
experience as well as learnt lessons will be presented.

Abstract: We present experimental techniques that employ an optical accordion lattice

solitons in optical lattices. The system allows precise control of lattice
parameters over a wide range of lattice spacings and depths. We detail
calibration methods for the lattice parameters that are adjusted to the varying
lattice spacing, and we demonstrate site-resolved atom number preparation via
microwave addressing. Lattice solitons are generated through rapid quenches of
the atomic interaction strength and the external trapping potential. We
systematically optimize the quench parameters, such as duration and final
scattering length, to maximize soliton stability. Our results provide insight
into nonlinear matter-wave dynamics in discretized systems and establish a
versatile platform for the controlled study of lattice solitons.

### [3] [Probing Fractional Quantum Hall states in weakly interacting Fermi gases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22606)
*Viktor Bekassy,Mikael Fogelström,Johannes Hofmann*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that certain quantum gas systems can simulate the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) without requiring rapid rotation. Even moderate rotation allows access to LLL states, which remain stationary in the system's many-body wave functions, while their energies shift. These states are exact eigenstates of specific interaction models and can be experimentally studied using new techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this work stems from the challenge of achieving rapid rotation in practical quantum gas experiments, which limits the simulation of LLL physics. By identifying scenarios where LLL states can emerge even without rapid rotation, the authors open up new avenues for studying interacting many-body systems, particularly in the context of the Fractional Quantum Hall effect.

Method: The authors use first-order perturbation theory to analyze the effect of rotation on many-body wave functions in weakly interacting Fermi gases. They demonstrate that, in the LLL, the wave functions remain unchanged at any rotation frequency, with only energy shifts occurring. They also employ exact diagonalization and analytical methods to investigate models with contact interactions, showing that LLL states are exact eigenstates of certain Haldane pseudopotential models used to describe Fractional Quantum Hall states.

Result: The study reveals that LLL states can emerge in rotating few-fermion systems even at moderate or no rotation, providing a new platform for exploring interacting many-body phenomena such as Laughlin and Haldane wave functions. The findings suggest that recent experimental techniques for rotating quantum gases can be utilized to study Fractional Quantum Hall states and investigate the crossover between small and large particle numbers.

Conclusion: This work broadens the understanding of systems that can simulate the LLL, offering a simpler and more practical approach to accessing LLL physics in quantum gases. The results highlight the potential for future experiments to study fundamental aspects of strongly correlated systems using rotating few-fermion setups.

Abstract: Quantum gases are used to simulate the physics of the lowest Landau level
(LLL) with neutral atoms, which in the simplest setup is achieved by rotating
the gas at the confining harmonic trap frequency, a requirement that is
difficult to achieve in practice. We point out that for weakly interacting
Fermi gases, this rapid-rotation limit is not needed to access the LLL: As a
direct consequence of first-order perturbation theory, many-body wave functions
of states in the LLL remain unchanged at any rotation, and only their energies
shift. This implies that even in the absence of rotations or for moderate
rotations frequencies, LLL states are present as excited states at finite
angular momentum. For fermions with contact interactions, these states are
exact eigenstates of a paradigmatic model of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH)
states described by a single Haldane pseudopotential ($V_1$ for spin-polarized
and $V_0$ for spinful systems), which realizes exact Laughlin and Haldane wave
functions. We suggest that recently developed excitation and imaging techniques
for rotating few-fermion systems allow for a detailed experimental
investigation of FQH wave functions and to study the crossover to large
particle number. We illustrate this for $N = 6$ spin-balanced fermions

Abstract: We describe a deterministic and experimentally feasible protocol for
generating entangled pairs of ultracold neutral atoms through controlled
dissociation of diatomic Feshbach molecules. The dissociation process naturally
produces nonlocal quantum correlations in spin, position-momentum, and path
degrees of freedom, enabling the deterministic preparation of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of massive particles and multiqubit states
through hyperentangled encoding. Having each atom of the pair prepared in a
matter waveguide, the scheme can be scaled to hundreds of parallel entanglement
sources in an array connected to a matter wave optical network of beam
splitters, phase shifters, interferometers, tunnel junctions and local
detectors. The protocol builds on established techniques, including
programmable optical potentials, high-fidelity single-particle control,
single-molecule initialization, controlled molecular dissociation, and quantum
gas microscopy with near-perfect detection, making it directly implementable
with current technology. The proposed architecture naturally integrates with
atomtronics circuits and chip-based matter-wave optics, offering a
deterministic entanglement source for quantum nonlocality tests, precision
metrology, and scalable neutral-atom quantum processors.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole
background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin
connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and
scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed
by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom,
whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms
encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground
state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their
half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect
the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via
out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling
accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map
out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody
fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization
transition.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Thermal states are thermal with respect to a fixed Hamiltonian. How much
information about this Hamiltonian can we ``bootstrap'' from the subsystems of
a thermal state? We attack the problem by positioning it as a subspecies of the
quantum marginal problem. In states that obey the quantum Markov property, the
Petz recovery map captures the knowledge of the larger system inherent in a
subsystem. We use the conditional mutual information to check the goodness of
Petz recovery, analytically in a random-matrix-theory-inspired hopping model
and numerically in an Ising-like spin chain model. We observe different
behavior in chaotic versus integrable phases of the model: in the chaotic
phase, the reconstruction works well at both very low and very high
temperatures, with some intermediate critical temperature at which
reconstruction works worst, whereas in the integrable phase reconstruction
breaks down at low temperatures.

Abstract: Radical pairs (also known as spin qubit pairs, electron-hole pairs) are
transient reaction intermediates that are found and utilised in all areas of
science. Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins
have been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory
requirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately
simulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly
accounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with
additional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product
state (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we
mitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically
encountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power
of these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair
systems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple
radical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely
capture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence
of the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product
yield. These directional sensitivities highlight the critical dependence of the
nuclear environment and underscore the necessity of fully quantum treatments in
spin biophysics, offering critical insights into avian magnetoreception
mechanisms. This work provides a robust computational framework applicable to a
broad range of scientific realms, which include spin chemistry, quantum
biology, and spintronics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We ask how quantum correlations can be distributed among many subsystems. To
address this, we define entanglement sharing schemes (ESS) where certain pairs
of subsystems allow entanglement to be recovered via local operations, while
other pairs must not. ESS schemes come in two variants, one where the partner
system with which entanglement should be prepared is known, and one where it is
not. In the case of known partners, we fully characterize the access structures
realizable for ESS when using stabilizer states, and construct efficient
schemes for threshold access structures, and give a conjecture for the access
structures realizable with general states. In the unknown partner case, we
again give a complete characterization in the stabilizer setting, additionally
give a complete characterization of the case where there are no restrictions on
unauthorized pairs, and we prove a set of necessary conditions on general
schemes which we conjecture are also sufficient. Finally, we give an
application of the theory of entanglement sharing to resolve an open problem
related to the distribution of entanglement in response to time-sensitive
requests in quantum networks.

### [9] [On the hardness of approximating minimum distances of quantum codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21469)

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The problem of computing distances of error-correcting codes is fundamental
in both the classical and quantum settings. While hardness for the classical
version of these problems has been known for some time (in both the exact and
approximate settings), it was only recently that Kapshikar and Kundu showed
these problems are also hard in the quantum setting. As our first main result,
we reprove this using arguably simpler arguments based on hypergraph product
codes. In particular, we get a direct reduction to CSS codes, the most commonly
used type of quantum code, from the minimum distance problem for classical
linear codes.
  Our second set of results considers the distance of a graph state, which is a
key parameter for quantum codes obtained via the codeword stabilized formalism.
We show that it is NP-hard to compute/approximate the distance of a graph state
when the adjacency matrix of the graph is the input. In fact, we show this is
true even if we only consider X-type errors of a graph state. Our techniques
moreover imply an interesting classical consequence: the hardness of computing
or approximating the distance of classical codes with rate equal to 1/2.
  One of the main motivations of the present work is a question raised by
Kapshikar and Kundu concerning the NP-hardness of approximation when there is
an additive error proportional to a quantum code's length. We show that no such
hardness can hold for hypergraph product codes. These observations suggest the
possibility of a new kind of square root barrier.

### [10] [Dynamics and Control of Two Coupled Quantum Oscillators: An Analytical Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21492)
*Ali Abu-Nada,Lian-Ao Wu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the control of two coupled quantum oscillators in a common Lorentzian environment by detuning their frequencies, comparing regular and irregular detuning schedules for optimal excitation suppression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to control decoherence and damping effects in quantum systems, particularly in non-Markovian environments, to achieve robust quantum operations.

Method: The authors employ an exact solution of the reduced dynamics without relying on the Born or Markov approximations, using closed-form propagation for each detuning segment. They analyze both regular (fixed period, width, amplitude) and irregular (period, width, amplitude jitter) detuning schedules.

Result: The results demonstrate that larger detuning amplitudes and higher duty cycles enhance protection against decoherence and damping. Irregular detuning performs comparably to regular detuning at higher duty cycles but is slightly less effective at low duty cycles.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical design guidelines for detuning parameters (amplitude, duty cycle, bath width) to optimize excitation suppression in controlled non-Markovian dynamics, offering an exact benchmark for future theoretical and experimental work on coherent population transfer and quantum memory.

Abstract: We analyze two coupled quantum oscillators in a common Lorentzian environment
and control them by detuning (temporarily shifting) their frequencies. The
reduced dynamics are solved exactly, without Born or Markov approximations, by
propagating each detuning segment in closed form. We study two control
schedules: regular detuning, with perfectly periodic on and off pulses of fixed
period, width, and amplitude; and irregular detuning, with the same on/off
structure but cycle-to-cycle jitter in period, width, and amplitude. Our main
observable is the average excitation number (AEN) of each mode. Detuning moves
the system away from the bath's spectral peak, suppressing decoherence and
damping non-Markovian revivals; in effectively Markovian baths the benefit is
small. We quantify performance with a simple time-domain suppression factor.
Larger detuning amplitudes and higher duty cycles yield stronger protection.
Irregular control is slightly weaker at low duty cycle but becomes comparable
to regular control as the duty cycle approaches one. These results give
practical design rules linking detuning, duty cycle, and bath width, and
provide an exact benchmark for controlled non-Markovian dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We compare the circuit depths for five different gate sets to implement a
quantum algorithm solving a drift-diffusion equation in two spatial dimensions.
Our algorithm uses diagonalisation by the quantum Fourier transform. The gate
sets are: An unconstrained gate set, the TK1 gate set from Quantinuum, the
native gate sets of IBM Heron and IonQ, and Fujitsu's space-time efficient
analog rotation (STAR) gate set. Our analysis covers a set of illustrative
scenarios using up to 22 qubits. We find that while scaling with spatial
resolution aligns with theoretical predictions in one dimension, scaling with
spatial dimension is less efficient than theorised due to overhead from block
encoding. Finally, using the STAR gate set, we find that even minimal problem
instances exceed the operational limits of current quantum hardware.

Abstract: Gated quenched SPAD detectors are widely used in quantum communication and
quantum computing setups employing high-repetition-rate lasers. Here, we
present a novel scheme for high-repetition-rate (100 MHz) sine-wave gated
SPADs, based on the self-differencing technique, which significantly simplifies
previous designs while offering additional advantages. These include
straightforward implementation, more precise control of the SPAD biasing, and
an improved SNR. We implemented this approach using an InGaAs photodiode and
characterized it experimentally with 100 MHz attenuated laser pulses, measuring
quantum efficiency, dark count rate, and afterpulsing behavior. Importantly, we
demonstrate that the detector recovers full quantum efficiency in less than one
pulse-repetition period after a detection event, enabling continuous operation
at 100 MHz, which, in principle, could reach the GHz regime.

Abstract: This thesis investigates sampling-based quantum algorithms for electronic
ground state energy estimation, focusing on Quantum-Selected Configuration
Interaction (QSCI) and Sample-Based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) as near-term
alternatives to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Unlike VQE, which
suffers from barren plateaus and high measurement costs, these methods avoid
variational optimization by sampling Slater determinants from quantum hardware
and performing diagonalization classically. The central contribution is the
first analytical expression for the sampling bottleneck: the
determinant-discovery step is mapped to the classical coupon-collector problem,
yielding both an exact formula and a scalable lower-bound estimator for the
number of measurements required to recover all determinants contributing to the
ground state. Previous work only relied on numerical sampling and estimation.
The analysis is validated through simulations, hardware-calibrated noisy
studies, and execution on IBM's 127-qubit IBM Brisbane processor, demonstrating
the dominant role of sampling efficiency in the near-term feasibility of QSCI
and SQD.
  This work was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Mohamed Taha Rouabah.

Abstract: Multi-photon correlations from quantum emitters coupled to vibrational
environments lie beyond the reach of standard tools such as the quantum
regression theorem (QRT). Here, we introduce a Markovian framework for
computing frequency-resolved $N$-photon correlation functions that overcomes
this limitation. Applying our approach to a driven semiconductor quantum dot
provides a tractable description of phonon effects on fluorescence beyond the
single-photon spectrum. Our method accurately captures the emergence of the
phonon sideband, missed by conventional QRT treatments, and reveals rich
phonon-induced structure in the filtered two-photon spectrum. Strikingly, we
find that photons emitted via the phonon sideband inherit second-order
coherence properties of the Mollow triplet.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method that we call Single-Shot Cross-Spectroscopy
(SSCS), for extracting the auto- and cross-power spectral densities of
dephasing noise of a qubit pair. The method uses straightforward input, namely
single-shot readouts from single-qubit Ramsey-type experiments, and is
resilient against errors in state preparation and measurement. We apply it to
experimental data from a semiconductor spin-qubit device and obtain noise
spectra over five orders of magnitude in frequency (5 mHz--500 Hz). Compared to
other techniques, SSCS enables access to noise correlations in the previously
inaccessible intermediate-frequency range (1--500 Hz) for spin qubits, and can
be further extended with faster readout. More broadly, the frequency range
accessible with SSCS is limited only by the experiment repetition rate, and
scales accordingly on other platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient quantum computations for phase change phenomena, given the limitations of classical methods in handling nonlinearities and time step restrictions.

Method: The QLBM implements an interface-tracking strategy within a quantum computing framework, utilizing the statistical nature of lattice Boltzmann methods while mitigating quantum hardware limitations by storing phase change information locally within quantum circuits.

Result: Simulations using 17 lattice nodes and 51 qubits achieved RMS errors below 0.005, confirming QLBM's effectiveness and accuracy in phase transition tracking.

Conclusion: QLBM represents a promising approach for analyzing thermal systems with phase transitions, offering a computationally efficient alternative to classical methods.

Abstract: Heat transfer involving phase change is computationally intensive due to
moving phase boundaries, nonlinear computations, and time step restrictions.
This paper presents a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM) for simulating
heat transfer with phase change. The approach leverages the statistical nature
of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) while addressing the challenges of
nonlinear phase transitions in quantum computing. The method implements an
interface-tracking strategy that partitions the problem into separate solid and
liquid domains, enabling the algorithm to handle the discontinuity in the
enthalpy-temperature relationship. We store phase change information in the
quantum circuit to avoid frequent information exchange between classical and
quantum hardware, a bottleneck in many quantum applications. Results from the
implementation agree with both classical LBM and analytical solutions,
demonstrating QLBM as an effective approach for analyzing thermal systems with
phase transitions. Simulations using 17 lattice nodes with 51 qubits
demonstrate root-mean-square (RMS) errors below 0.005 when compared against
classical solutions. The method accurately tracks interface movement during
phase transition.

Conclusion: 这项研究为实际中的私有化分布式量子测距协议开发提供了可能性，尤其是在连续变量量子网络中。

Abstract: We study the privacy properties of distributed quantum sensing protocols in a
Gaussian quantum network, where each node encodes a parameter via a local phase
shift. For networks with more than two nodes, achieving perfect privacy is
possible only asymptotically, in the limit of large photon numbers. However, we
show that optimized fully symmetric Gaussian states enable rapidly approaching
perfect privacy while maintaining near-optimal sensing performance. We show
that local homodyne detection achieves a quadratic scaling of precision with
the total number of photons. We further analyze the impact of thermal noise in
the preparation stage on both privacy and estimation precision. Our results
pave the way for the development of practical, private distributed quantum
sensing protocols in continuous-variable quantum networks.

Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in quantum physics is to quantify the
entanglement of $d$-partite states and their separability. We show here that
these problems are best addressed using tensors. The geometric measure of
entanglement of a pure state is one of most natural ways to quantify the
entanglement, which is simply related to the spectral norm of a tensor state.
On the other hand, the logarithm of the nuclear norm of the state and density
tensors can be considered as its ``energy''. We first show that the most
geometric measure entangled $d$-partite state has the minimum spectral norm and
maximum nuclear norm. Second, we introduce the notion of Hermitian and density
tensors, and the subspace of bi-symmetric Hermitian tensors, which correspond
to Bosons. We show that separable density tensors, and strongly separable
bi-symmetric density tensors are characterized by the value (equal to one) of
their corresponding nuclear norms. In general, these characterizations are
NP-hard to verify. Third, we show that the above quantities are computed in
polynomial time when we restrict our attentions to Bosons: symmetric
$d$-qubits, or more generally to symmetric $d$-qunits in $C^n$, and the
corresponding bi-symmetric Hermtian density tensors, for a fixed value of $n$.

Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo method with operator-loop update is a powerful technique
that has been extensively used with great success in condensed matter physics.
It enables one to sample from thermal and ground states of local Hamiltonians
of various spin, bosonic and fermionic systems as long as the Hamiltonian does
not have a negative-sign problem. Despite the practical success of this method,
theoretical understanding of the efficiency of the algorithm has been lacking.
The operator-loop update is commonly used for path-integral formulation
(Suzuki-Trotter/world-lines) of the partition function. In this work we
consider this method applied to the stoquastic (sign-problem free) XY model and
prove that the mixing time of the Markov chain is polynomial in the system size
and the inverse temperature. Using the fast mixing Markov chain, we can
estimate the partition functions of the Hamiltonians that we consider in a
polynomial time, significantly improving upon the best known previous algorithm
by Bravyi and Gosset [arXiv:1612.05602]. Our algorithm also allows for natural
extensions to a wide class of empirically fast-mixing Hamiltonians.

Abstract: An efficient implementation of unitary operators is important in order to
practically realize the computational advantages claimed by quantum algorithms
over their classical counterparts. In this paper we study the potential of
using reinforcement learning (RL) in order to synthesize quantum circuits,
while optimizing the T-count and CS-count, of unitaries that are exactly
implementable by the Clifford+T and Clifford+CS gate sets, respectively. In
general, the complexity of existing algorithms depend exponentially on the
number of qubits and the non-Clifford-count of unitaries. We have designed our
RL framework to work with channel representation of unitaries, that enables us
to perform matrix operations efficiently, using integers only. We have also
incorporated pruning heuristics and a canonicalization of operators, in order
to reduce the search complexity. As a result, compared to previous works, we
are able to implement significantly larger unitaries, in less time, with much
better success rate and improvement factor. Our results for Clifford+T
synthesis on two qubits achieve close-to-optimal decompositions for up to 100 T
gates, 5 times more than previous RL algorithms and to the best of our
knowledge, the largest instances achieved with any method to date. Our RL
algorithm is able to recover previously-known optimal linear complexity
algorithm for T-count-optimal decomposition of 1 qubit unitaries. For 2-qubit
Clifford+CS unitaries, our algorithm achieves a linear complexity, something
that could only be accomplished by a previous algorithm using $SO(6)$
representation.

Abstract: The intrinsic equivalence between electron spin and qubit offers a natural
foundation for quantum simulations of magnetic materials. However,
incorporating magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), a key feature of real
magnets, remains a major challenge. Here, we develop a quantum simulation
framework for MCA in CuSb2O6, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet with alternating
ferromagnetic chains arising from frustrated, anisotropic exchange interactions
in a nearly square lattice. The $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ spin network is modeled as a
four-qubit square lattice, with four paired ancilla qubits introduced to encode
angle-dependent MCA. This two-qubit representation per spin site resolves the
limitation that squared Pauli operators yield only the identity, enabling MCA
terms to be faithfully embedded into quantum circuits. Using the variational
quantum eigensolver, we determine an exceptionally small easy-axis MCA
constant, just 0.00022% of the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, yet
sufficient to drive a spin-flop transition with $90^{\circ}$ spin reorientation
and strong angular variation in magnetic torque. Beyond this regime, the
simulations uncover a half-saturated magnetic phase at ultra-high fields,
stabilized by anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor interactions. Our findings
demonstrate the feasibility of resource-efficient quantum simulations of
complex magnetic phenomena in real materials.

TL;DR: We introduce a machine learning method using convolutional neural networks to estimate covariance matrices of Gaussian quantum states, especially in the presence of thermal noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating covariance matrices of quantum states is crucial for quantum information processing and certification. Traditional methods like density matrix reconstructions are computationally intensive, making it challenging to handle impure squeezed vacuum states with thermal noise.

Method: The proposed method employs supervised machine learning with convolutional neural networks. It models impure squeezed vacuum states as a mixture of thermal and squeezed thermal states. The approach uses sparse measurements of quadrature sequences to reconstruct the covariance matrix efficiently.

Result: The machine learning method achieves high fidelity and precision, even at high squeezing levels. It accurately estimates the covariance matrix and exhibits robustness to thermal state admixtures. It also demonstrates the ability to quantify experimental degradation of squeezing and purity.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for efficient and accurate covariance matrix estimation of Gaussian quantum states, even in noisy environments. The method lays the groundwork for real-time quantum state tomography of thermal multi-component Gaussian states in multi-mode systems.

Abstract: We present a supervised machine learning-based method using convolutional
neural networks to estimate the covariance matrix of Gaussian quantum states in
the presence of thermal noise. Unlike computationally intensive density matrix
reconstructions, our machine learning-based method allows for the
reconstruction of impure squeezed vacuum states using sparse measurements of
quadrature sequences based on a model employing a two-component state mixed
together from thermal and squeezed thermal states. The method achieves high
fidelity and precision, notably also at high squeezing levels, while offering
an effective characterization of physical quantities and accurately estimating
the covariance matrix. We benchmark our machine against experimental data of
single-mode squeezed vacuum states, demonstrating its accuracy and capability
to quantify experimental degradation to squeezing and purity. We experimentally
verify that our covariance matrix estimation exhibits robustness to state
degradation induced by thermal state admixtures. We provide a method for
lightweight, compact, and complete representation of lab-generated Gaussian
states and lay the foundation for extending real-time quantum state tomography
for thermal multi-component Gaussian states to multi-mode systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The idea behind entanglement is counterintuitive to any classical viewpoint
of physical realism. An entangled state is a nonlocal superposition of
realities that belong to a physical system. The common test of such a state has
been done through Bell measurements. In this work, we attempt to look at this
notion from a different perspective. We study the evolution of the orbital
angular momentum (OAM) entanglement in inertia reference frames under a Lorentz
boost. We consider two specific motions for the observers of the entanglement.
First, we consider observers with zero relative motion (Zero-RM). Second, we
choose to have a non-zero relative motion (Non-Zero RM) for them. In the second
case, we distinguish between observer's perspective of the amplitude
probability from the perspective of rest (Non-Zero RM1) and moving (Non-Zero
RM2) observers. As a result, the transition probability amplitudes are altered.
We observe that entanglement undergoes significant changes and is not preserved
maximally from the viewpoint of the stationary observers at the rest frame and
asymptotically approaches a minimum close to the light cone (LC). However, from
the viewpoint of moving observer in the Non-Zero RM2, entanglement will not
survive, and the final state is separable. This is an extremely important
observation since the concept of entanglement is supposed to be non-local, and
therefore free from any spacetime transformation. Our results demonstrated
through the entanglement metrics such as entanglement entropy and purity show
that an entangled state is not non-local and hence the so-called collapse of
the wavefunction in quantum mechanics does not occur spontaneously in
spacetime. Ironically, even entanglement is influenced by motion. Finally,
based on this study, one can predict that photons do not carry OAM
fundamentally and this property is only emergent at the light-matter
interaction limit.

Abstract: We study the limitations on observing transient amplification in atomic
systems exhibiting electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and evaluate
the limits of optical Bloch equation (OBE) models. Using propagation-based
Maxwell-Bloch simulations, we show that single-atom, spatially uniform OBE
treatments overestimate gain by neglecting propagation dynamics. In two-level
systems, this yields incorrect transmission, while in three-level systems, it
predicts unrealistically large amplification. Furthermore, we show that Doppler
averaging in warm vapor suppresses oscillatory ringing and the maximum
achievable gain. Our results explain discrepancies between OBE predictions and
experimental observations, and establish practical limits on transient gain in
cold and thermally broadened EIT media.

*Gabriel H. S. Aguiar,George E. A. Matsas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper argues that classical mechanics is an effective theory arising from quantum mechanics but claims quantum mechanics is unreliable for describing macroscopic systems' centers of mass. It introduces a model for how these systems classicalize, yet shows that macroscopic systems with classical centers of mass can have quantum internal vibrations, as observed in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the boundary between classical and quantum physics is crucial for the development of a unified physical theory. This paper aims to clarify this boundary and propose a mechanism for decoherence in macroscopic systems.

Method: The authors developed a simple gravitational self-decoherence model within the framework of quantum mechanics to explain how macroscopic systems' centers of mass become classical. They then used experimental observations to validate the model.

Result: The proposed model does not prevent macroscopic systems with classical centers of mass from having quantum internal vibrations, findings consistent with laboratory observations.

Conclusion: The paper challenges the notion that classical mechanics is merely an approximation of quantum mechanics for macroscopic systems. It suggests that quantum internal degrees of freedom can coexist with classical centers of mass, supporting the idea that quantum mechanics remains valid even at macroscopic scales.

Abstract: Harmonizing classical and quantum worlds is a major challenge for modern
physics. A significant portion of the scientific community supports the notion
that classical mechanics is an effective theory that arises from quantum
mechanics. Recently, the present authors have argued that this should not be
the case, as quantum mechanics is not trustworthy for describing the center of
mass of systems with masses $m$ much larger than the Planck mass $M_\text{P}$.
In this vein, a simple gravitational self-decoherence model was proposed,
describing how the center of mass of quantum systems would classicalize for $m
\sim M_\text{P}$. Here, we show that our model does not prevent macroscopic
systems (with classical centers of mass) from harboring quantum internal
vibrations (as has been observed in the laboratory).

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A two-mode bosonic encoding of a qu octit within a non-Abelian group-structured constellation of coherent states is explored, motivated by the need for transversal non-Abelian logical gates in quantum computing and particle physics. The encoding method, an extension of the previously developed $2T$-constellation for a qutrit, is evaluated, and its fidelity is compared to other bosonic qudits under different noise models. The approach shows promise for constructing higher-dimensional qudits, such as quicosotetris, in bosonic systems, with practical applications in quantum simulations and particle physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is driven by the importance of non-Abelian symmetry in particle physics and quantum computing, particularly in enabling transversal non-Abelian logical gates, which are essential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The desire to leverage these symmetries in constructing quantum simulations and advancing particle physics research is the primary motivation.

Method: The research utilizes a two-mode bosonic encoding scheme within a non-Abelian group-structured constellation of coherent states. This builds upon the $2T$-constellation framework developed for a qutrit, extending it to a quoctit (a four-dimensional qudit). The methodology involves benchmarking the fidelity of the resulting qudits under various noise models to establish their performance relative to existing bosonic qudits.

Result: The benchmarking reveals that the two-mode bosonic encoding of the quoctit achieves acceptable fidelity under different noise models, outperforming other bosonic qudits when practical constraints such as power usage are considered. This suggests that the encoding method is viable for constructing higher-dimensional qudits like quicosotetris in bosonic systems.

Conclusion: The proposed two-mode bosonic encoding of a quoctit within a non-Abelian group-structured constellation of coherent states is a promising approach for realizing transversal non-Abelian logical gates in quantum computing. The results, which show favorable fidelity compared to other bosonic qudits under practical constraints, open the door for the construction of higher-dimensional qudits in bosonic systems, with significant implications for quantum simulations in particle physics.

Abstract: In this work, we study a two-mode bosonic encoding of a quoctit inside a
non-Abelian group-structured constellation of coherent states. This work is
motivated by the importance of nonabelian symmetry in particle physics and the
desire to have transversal nonabelian logical gates. We use the previously
developed $2T$-constellation of states used to encode a so-called $2T$-qutrit.
The fidelity of the $2T$-quoctit is benchmarked against other bosonic qudits
for different noise models and find it compare favorably when power constraints
are considered. This paves the way for the construction of higher-dimensional
qudits (e.g. a quicosotetrit with $2T$ group structure) in bosonic systems with
practical applications in quantum simulations of particle physics.

Method: The authors extend basic properties to cases where measures are only defined by bounds and analyze these extended properties under both one-shot and uniform scenarios.

Result: The measures are shown to be LOCC monotones under efficient families of LOCC channels, with properties extending from one-shot to uniform scenarios.

Conclusion: These findings advance our understanding of computational entanglement measures and their applicability under bounded resources, particularly for LOCC operations.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a useful resource for implementing communication
tasks. However, for the resource to be useful in practice, it needs to be
accessible by parties with bounded computational resources. Computational
entanglement measures quantify the usefulness of entanglement in the presence
of limited computational resources. In this paper, we analyze systematically
some basic properties of two recently introduced computational entanglement
measures, the computational distillable entanglement and entanglement cost. To
do so, we introduce lower bound and upper bound extensions of basic properties
to address the case when entanglement measures are not defined by a scalar
value but when only lower or upper function bounds are available. In
particular, we investigate the lower bound convexity and upper bound concavity
properties of such measures, and the upper and lower bound additivity with
respect to the tensor product. We also observe that these measures are not
invariant with local unitaries, although invariance is recovered for efficient
unitaries. As a consequence, we obtain that these measures are only LOCC
monotones under efficient families of LOCC channels. Our analysis covers both
the one-shot scenario and the uniform setting, with properties established for
the former naturally extending to the latter.

Abstract: We demonstrate a general protocol for realizing fast high-fidelity
multi-qubit gates, through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to
a central qubit coupled to target qubits. This way, we are able to control the
states of the target qubits by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the
central qubit, eliminating the need for slow error-prone direct control. The
DD-gate protocol is developed and experimentally implemented within two
distinct frameworks: a hardware-agnostic model with minimal assumptions,
benchmarked within a general-purpose digital quantum simulator given by the
IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with nitrogen-15 vacancy center
($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Likewise, we are able to thoroughly characterize the
quantum mechanical dynamics behind the multi-qubit gates within IBMQ, without
many of the experimental constraints faced by other quantum systems. While at
the same time, we establish the protocol for the $^{15}$NV system, considering
its specific properties. The DD-gates with $^{15}$NVs can represent a
significant reduction in gate times and improved technological scalability,
compared to current methods of target qubit control using dynamical decoupling.
In addition, we propose a simple application of the method for high-efficiency
polarization generation of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin. All experimental findings
are supported by comprehensive open-source simulations in the two distinct
frameworks. This work provides a robust hardware-agnostic strategy for quantum
control, which can be implemented with arbitrary systems that fit the
central-target qubits description. Thus, marking an essential step in
technological scalability of future quantum devices.

Conclusion: 该研究为 multipartite 环境下一类纠缠度量的渐近分析提供了新的视角，特别是在 LOCC_q 情境下的可操作性和链接性分析方面。

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) in the context of
multipartite entanglement measures on pure states. Specifically, we formulate
AEP for subadditive entanglement measures that admit certain weak conditions.
This is motivated by the uniqueness of the entanglement entropy in the
asymptotic limit in the bipartite case. On the other hand, its operational
relevance comes from the $\text{LOCC}_q$ scenario (asymptotic local operations
and classical communication with a sublinear amount of quantum communication).
Analogously to the classical AEP, we prove that the regularization of smooth
weakly additive entanglement measures (subject to some weak extra conditions)
yields weakly additive and asymptotically continuous entanglement measures.
Then evaluate the mentioned regularization and smoothing on known R\'enyi type
multipartite entanglement measures, showing that the resulting regularized
entanglement measures reduce to convex combinations of bipartite entanglement
entropies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者对量子复杂性中的非平衡效应感兴趣，可能与量子退相干和资源理论相关。

Method: 通过研究随机量子电路中的相干性、纯度、非高斯性和魔幻态资源的动力学，使用量子资源理论框架。

Result: 相干性和纯度在初始化资源丰沛的状态时显示出量子Mpemba效应，而非高斯性和魔幻态没有。

Conclusion: Mpemba效应不仅见于热力学和不对称性，还广泛存在于描述量子复杂性的资源理论中。

Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the phenomenon whereby systems farther from equilibrium
may relax faster. In this work, we show that this counterintuitive behavior
appears in the very measures that define quantum complexity. Using the
framework of quantum resource theories, we study the dynamics of coherence,
imaginarity, non-Gaussianity, and magic state resources in random circuit
models. Our results reveal that coherence and imaginarity display a quantum
Mpemba effect when the system is initialized in resourceful product states,
while non-Gaussianity and magic do not. Strikingly, all four resources exhibit
the so-called Pontus-Mpemba effect: an initial "preheating" stage accelerates
relaxation compared to direct "cooling" dynamics. Taken together, our findings
show that Mpemba physics extends beyond thermodynamics and asymmetry, emerging
broadly in the resource theories that capture aspects of quantum complexity.

TL;DR: AQEC enhances bosonic qubit coherence through specific controls, improving times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Making quantum computing practical by ceasing reliance on measurement-based feedback.

Method: Developed an AQEC protocol based on quantum channel simulation applicable to any QEC code. Experimentally implemented with a binomial code in a long-lived bosonic mode (lifetime > 1ms). Achieved 1.04x improved logical qubit coherence time over the best physical qubit.

Result: AQEC-protected bosonic logical qubit exceeded the break-even point, enhancing coherence time by adding only drive and dissipation. Demonstrates AQEC's performance and scalability for large-scale universal quantum computing.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for scalable and practical quantum computing through innovative quantum error correction techniques with autonomous systems.

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) aims to mitigate the loss of quantum
information to the environment, which is a critical requirement for practical
quantum computing. Existing QEC implementations heavily rely on
measurement-based feedback, however, constraints on readout fidelity, hardware
latency, and system complexity often limit both performance and scalability.
Autonomous QEC (AQEC) seeks to overcome these obstacles by stabilizing logical
codewords using introduced drives that provide coherent control and engineered
dissipation. Here, we propose an AQEC protocol, derived from quantum channel
simulation, that is applicable to arbitrary error-correcting codes. As a
demonstration, we implement the protocol using a binomial code encoded in a
long-lived bosonic mode (lifetime > 1ms), and extend the logical qubit
coherence time to 1.04 times that of the best physical qubit in the system.
This is the first experimental realization of an AQEC-protected bosonic logical
qubit beyond the break-even point, proving that coherence time can indeed be
extended by introducing only drives and dissipation. Our results highlight the
performance and scalability potential of AQEC, marking an important step toward
large-scale, universal quantum computing.

### [35] [Two times or none?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22264)
*Michael Ridley,Eliahu Cohen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了将时间与空间置于量子力学框架中等同性的问题，指出了两种不同的方法：一种是'Timeless'方法，如Page和Wootters提出的，另一种是Bauer提出的基于'伪自旋'的扩展状态空间的'Two-time'方法。这两种方法都定义了时间算符，并且前者是研究较多的'Timeless'框架，后者是我们相对较少探讨的'Two-time'方法。论文比较了这两种方法，并指出选择哪一个框架是一个不易调和的权衡。此外，论文还探讨了如何将'Timeless'哲学与'Two-time'量子力学结合起来，形成一个综合的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时间在量子力学中的定位是一个基础但挑战性的问题。时间作为物理量通常与空间不同，如何将其置于与空间同等的地位是量子力学发展中的一个重要课题。该论文通过比较两种不同的方法，试图为这一问题提供更深入的理解。

Method: 论文首先介绍了'Timeless'方法，如Page和Wootters的理论，该方法允许定义一个有意义的时间算符。然后，它讨论了Bauer提出的基于'伪自旋'扩展状态空间的'Two-time'方法，这种方法引入了反向时间的自由度。随后，论文比较了这两种方法的优缺点，最后探讨了如何将'Timeless'框架与'Two-time'量子力学结合起来。

Result: 论文的主要结论是，尽管'Timeless'方法已经很成熟，但'Two-time'方法提供了另一种有趣的可能性，两者在定义时间算符和处理时间对称性方面存在有趣的关系。论文还指出，将'Timeless'哲学与'Two-time'量子力学相结合是一个有希望的方向，值得进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该论文通过对比两种不同的时间量子化方法，展示了在量子力学中处理时间问题时存在的多种可能性。这为未来的研究提供了丰富的灵感，尽管两种方法都有其挑战性，但其互补性提示了一种可能的统一框架。

Abstract: Attempts to treat time on an equivalent footing with space in quantum
mechanics have been apparently dominated by `timeless' approaches, such as the
one of Page and Wootters, which allow meaningful discussion of a `time
operator'. However, there is an alternative, and significantly less studied
approach, due to Bauer, which makes use of the `pseudospin' extension of the
state space, effectively adding a backwards-time degree of freedom. This
two-time approach allows definition of a `time operator' and moreover bears
interesting relations with other time-symmetric formulations of quantum
mechanics. We review and compare these approaches to quantum time, emphasizing
that there is a subtle choice between the timeless framework and the two-time
approach. Finally, we sketch a framework in which the timeless philosophy can
be combined with two-time quantum mechanics.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了如何利用量子计算的优势，设计出一种更高效的单轮安全多方计算协议，并对未来密码学研究具有重要的参考价值。

Abstract: We introduce Verifiable One-Time Programs (Ver-OTPs) and use them to
construct single-round Open Secure Computation (OSC), a novel primitive
enabling applications like (1) single-round sealed-bid auctions, (2)
single-round and honest-majority atomic proposes -- a building block of
consensus protocols, and (3) single-round differentially private statistical
aggregation without pre-registration. First, we construct Ver-OTPs from
single-qubit states and classical cryptographic primitives. Then, assuming a
multi-key homomorphic scheme (MHE) with certain properties, we use Ver-OTPs
with MHE to construct OSC. The underlying quantum requirement is minimal: only
single-qubit states are needed alongside a hardware assumption on the
receiver's quantum resources. Our work therefore provides a new framework for
quantum-assisted cryptography that may be implementable with near-term quantum
technology.

Abstract: The development of emerging technologies in quantum optics demands accurate
models that faithfully capture genuine quantum effects. Mature semiclassical
approaches reach their limits when confronted with quantized electromagnetic
fields, while full Hilbert space treatments are often computationally
prohibitive. To address these challenges, we develop a framework based on
coupled stochastic processes with a common cross-covariance structure that can
be easily coupled to various types of Maxwell solvers. Our approach accounts
for the non-commutativity in the quantum-to-classical transition in a natural
way, and has the ability to capture quantum optical signatures while retaining
compatibility with classical electromagnetics. For benchmarking, we compare our
simulation results with experimental emission spectra of a strongly driven
InGaAs quantum dot, finding excellent agreement. Our results highlight the
potential of tailored stochastic processes for simulating non-classical light
in complex photonic environments.

Abstract: An efficient decoder is essential for quantum error correction, and
data-driven neural decoders have emerged as promising, flexible solutions.
Here, we introduce a diffusion model framework to infer logical errors from
syndrome measurements in quantum low-density parity-check codes. Using the
bivariate bicycle code with realistic circuit-level noise, we show that masked
diffusion decoders are more accurate, often faster on average, and always
faster in the worst case than other state-of-the-art decoders, including belief
propagation with ordered statistics decoding (BP-OSD) and autoregressive neural
decoders. We show that by using fewer diffusion steps during inference one can
gain significant speed at minimal cost in accuracy. By examining the factored
attention from our trained neural network we find that, despite being trained
solely on paired samples of syndrome-logical errors, this diffusion decoder
learns the structure of the quantum codes. We also compare both masked and
continuous diffusion decoders on code-capacity noise models, finding that
masked diffusion decoders scale better than continuous diffusion decoders.

Abstract: Classification using variational quantum circuits is a promising frontier in
quantum machine learning. Quantum supervised learning (QSL) applied to
classical data using variational quantum circuits involves embedding the data
into a quantum Hilbert space and optimizing the circuit parameters to train the
measurement process. In this context, the efficacy of QSL is inherently
influenced by the selection of quantum embedding. In this study, we introduce a
classical-quantum hybrid approach for optimizing quantum embedding beyond the
limitations of the standard circuit model of quantum computation (i.e.,
completely positive and trace-preserving maps) for general multi-channel data.
We benchmark the performance of various models in our framework using the
CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets and provide theoretical analyses that guide
model design and optimization.

Abstract: Estimating a classical parameter encoded in the Hamiltonian of a quantum
probe is a fundamental and well-understood task in quantum metrology. A
textbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a
two-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work,
we explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent
quantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For
both metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI)
of the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the
QFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the
interaction time $\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single
coherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the
non-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be
approached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\alpha$, the
QFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\tau =O(1)$ and $\tau
=O(\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times. When the
atom interacts with a sequence of coherent states, the QFI can increase with
time but is bounded to scale linearly due to the production of entanglement
between the atom and the radiation (back-action), except in the limit where the
number of modes and their total energy diverge. Finally, in the continuous
limit, where the atom interacts with many weak coherent states, this
back-action can be simply interpreted as spontaneous emission, giving rise to
the optimal interaction time and QFI rate.

Abstract: We prove three structural impossibility results demonstrating that fuzzy
metric spaces cannot capture essential features of quantum state geometry.
First, we show they cannot model destructive interference between concepts due
to phase insensitivity. Second, we prove there is no distance-preserving
embedding from quantum state space into any fuzzy metric space. Third, we
establish that fuzzy logic cannot distinguish symmetric from antisymmetric
concept combinations -- a fundamental limitation for modeling structured
knowledge. These theorems collectively show that fuzzy frameworks are
structurally incapable of representing intrinsic uncertainty, where quantum
mechanics provides a superior, geometrically coherent alternative.

Abstract: Dynamical systems appear in nearly every aspect of the physical world. As
such, understanding the properties of dynamical systems is of great importance.
Typically, a dynamical system is described by a system of ordinary differential
equations (ODE). Most ODEs do not admit analytical solutions, which makes
dynamical systems challenging to understand. In this work, we introduce a
quantum framework for determining certain properties of dynamical systems. We
combine many recent advances in quantum algorithms, particularly quantum ODE
solver and quantum topological data analysis. Leveraging the prior results
regarding the quantum ODE solvers, we use the output of these quantum
algorithms as a means to build the graph associated with the trajectory of the
dynamical system in the phase space. This graph information is then fed into
existing quantum TDA algorithms, respectively, to obtain the (normalized) Betti
numbers, which are the topological signatures. We then discuss how such
signatures can be linked to the properties of a given ODE, and thus, they can
reveal insight towards the original dynamical systems. As a by-product, our
work provides an affirmative answer to the applicability of quantum ODE
solvers, showing that the quantum state as output can be valuable for useful
purposes.

Abstract: Preparing desired quantum states and quantum operations (processes) is
essential for numerous tasks in quantum computation. Several approaches have
been developed for optimal control of quantum states, whereas optimal
strategies for preparation of a given quantum process have remained fairly less
explored. For some applications, rather than a specific desired state or
process, it may suffice to obtain states or processes with specific desired
features such as (high) coherence or purity. In such cases, fidelity-based
measures alone are inadequate for evaluating the performance of a quantum
control strategy, and hence proper feature-based figures of merit should be
employed. Here we develop a feature-based optimal coherent control formalism
for open quantum processes under Markovian evolutions which demonstrate high
coherence and purity features. In particular, we observe that performance of
the feature-based Krotov optimization algorithm can be improved by choosing
educated initial guess fields. In addition, in a model for a qutrit Rydberg
system, it is shown that the convex overlap-based fidelity outperforms other
process-based as well as state-based fidelities. This analysis underscores the
utility of feature-based optimal control strategies for quantum processes.

Our results provide examples where the folklore belief that typical
translation-invariant Hamiltonians are gapped can be proved, which extends a

general bounded-degree graphs. We derive the gaps by analytically verifying
generalized Knabe-type finite-size criteria that apply to any bounded-degree

Abstract: To simulate plasma phenomena, large-scale computational resources have been
employed in developing high-precision and high-resolution plasma simulations.
One of the main obstacles in plasma simulations is the requirement of
computational resources that scale polynomially with the number of spatial
grids, which poses a significant challenge for large-scale modeling. To address
this issue, this study presents a quantum algorithm for simulating the
nonlinear electromagnetic fluid dynamics that govern space plasmas. We map it,
by applying Koopman-von Neumann linearization, to the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
and evolve the system using Hamiltonian simulation via quantum singular value
transformation. Our algorithm scales $O \left(s N_x \, \mathrm{polylog} \left(
N_x \right) T \right)$ in time complexity with $s$, $N_x$, and $T$ being the
spatial dimension, the number of spatial grid points per dimension, and the
evolution time, respectively. Comparing the scaling $O \left( s N_x^s
\left(T^{5/4}+T N_x\right) \right)$ for the classical method with the finite
volume scheme, this algorithm achieves polynomial speedup in $N_x$. The space
complexity of this algorithm is exponentially reduced from $O\left( s N_x^s
\right)$ to $O\left( s \, \mathrm{polylog} \left( N_x \right) \right)$.
Numerical experiments validate that accurate solutions are attainable with
smaller $m$ than theoretically anticipated and with practical values of $m$ and
$R$, underscoring the feasibility of the approach. As a practical
demonstration, the method accurately reproduces the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, underscoring its capability to tackle more intricate nonlinear
dynamics. These results suggest that quantum computing can offer a viable
pathway to overcome the computational barriers of multiscale plasma modeling.

Motivation: Improving the controllability and reducing bias in quantum generative models is crucial for practical applications in quantum machine learning.

Method: Introduce a modular architecture with a lightweight controller circuit that combines control without full retraining, leveraging IQP's advantages for minimal overhead.

Result: Experiments show ConQuER achieves precise control, balanced generation, and low overhead on quantum state datasets.

Conclusion: ConQuER bridges the gap between quantum computational advantages and practical generation control needs.

Abstract: Quantum generative models based on instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP)
circuits show great promise in learning complex distributions while maintaining
classical trainability. However, current implementations suffer from two key
limitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe
generation bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable
Quantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through
a modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit
that can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely
control the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the
advantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as
the Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In
addition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach
through data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the
underlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on
structured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties
and high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum
state datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced
generation performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP
circuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum
computing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling.

quantisation approach, under periodic (PBC) and Dirichlet (DBC) boundary
conditions. The wavefunction is discretised across a finite grid represented by
system qubits, and the squared momentum operator is expressed using the
finite-difference method based on quantum translation operations. The
relativistic kinetic energy is approximated through a perturbative expansion of
the total kinetic Hamiltonian, incorporating higher-order momentum terms. The
approach would allow variational optimisation of appropriate ansatz states to
estimate both non-relativistic and relativistic ground-state energies on a
quantum computer. This work offers a practical route to simulating relativistic
effects on near-term quantum devices, supporting future developments in quantum
physics and chemistry.

Abstract: We provide a systematic construction for local quantum circuits hosting free
fermions in disguise, both with staircase and brickwork architectures. Similar
to the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are
defined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time
step can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but
still displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of
suitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator,
allowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum. We also study the
dynamics of these circuits after they are initialized in arbitrary product
states, proving that the evolution of certain local observables can be
simulated efficiently on classical computers. Our work proves recent
conjectures in the literature and raises new questions on the classical
simulability of free fermions in disguise.

Abstract: Quantum annealing has emerged as a powerful tool for solving combinatorial

mechanics. Companies are increasingly investing in the market of quantum
computers, providing the users with the possibility to solve these optimization

Annealing can be applied to the Currency Arbitrage (CA) optimization problem
and its comparative performance against classical methods. A key contribution
of the work is an original formulation of the CA problem as a QUBO (Quadratic

Abstract: Quantum randomness evidently transcends the classical framework of random
variables defined on a single comprehensive Kolmogorov probability space. One
prominent example is the quantum double-slit experiment due to Feynman (1951,
1966). A related non-quantum example, inspired by Boole (1862) and Vorob$'$ev
(1962), has three two-valued random variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, where the pairs
$X, Y$ and $X, Z$ are perfectly correlated, yet $Y, Z$ are perfectly
anti-correlated. Such examples can be accommodated using a ``multi-measurable''
space with several different $ \sigma $-algebras of measurable events. This
concept due to Vorob$'$ev (1962) allows construction of: 1) a measurable
meta\-space whose elements combine a point in the original sample space with a
variable ``contextual'' Boolean algebra; 2) a parametric family of probability
meta\-spaces, each of which is a Kolmogorov probability space that represents a
two-stage stochastic process where a random choice from the original sample
space is preceded by the random choice of a contextual Boolean algebra in the
multi-measurable space. Subsequent work will explore how quantum experimental
results can be described using a quantum measurement tree with one or more
preparation nodes where an experimental configuration is determined that
governs the probability distribution of relevant quantum observables.

Abstract: Given a quantum state in the finite-dimensional Hilbert space $ \C^n $, the
range of possible values of a quantum observable is usually identified with the
discrete spectrum of eigenvalues of a corresponding Hermitian matrix. Here any
such observable is identified with: (i) an ``ortho-measurable'' function
defined on the Boolean ``ortho-algebra'' generated by the eigenspaces that form
an orthogonal decomposition of $ \C^n $; (ii) a ``numerically identified''
orthogonal decomposition of $ \C^n $. The latter means that each subspace of
the orthogonal decomposition can be uniquely identified by its own attached
real number, just as each eigenspace of a Hermitian matrix can be uniquely
identified by the corresponding eigenvalue. Furthermore, any density matrix on
$ \C^n $ is identified with a Bayesian prior ``ortho-probability'' measure
defined on the linear subspaces that make up the Boolean ortho-algebra induced
by its eigenspaces. Then any pure quantum state is identified with a degenerate
density matrix, and any mixed state with a probability measure on a set of
orthogonal pure states. Finally, given any quantum observable, the relevant
Bayesian posterior probabilities of measured outcomes can be found by the usual
trace formula that extends Born's rule.

Abstract: The quantum Schur transform has become a foundational quantum algorithm, yet
even after two decades since the seminal 2005 paper by Bacon, Chuang, and
Harrow (BCH), some aspects of the transform remain insufficiently understood.
Moreover, an alternative approach proposed by Krovi in 2018 was recently found
to contain a crucial error. In this paper, we present a corrected version of
Krovi's algorithm along with a detailed treatment of the high-dimensional
version of the BCH Schur transform. This high-dimensional focus makes the two
versions of the transform practical for regimes where the number of qudits $n$
is smaller than the local dimension $d$, with Krovi's algorithm scaling as
$\widetilde{O}(n^4)$ and BCH as $\widetilde{O}(\min(n^5,nd^4))$. Our work
addresses a key gap in the literature, strengthening the algorithmic
foundations of a wide range of results that rely on Schur--Weyl duality in
quantum information theory and quantum computation.

Conclusion: 机器学习模式能显著提高气象分析的精度和预报能力。

Abstract: The hybrid model combines the physics-based primitive-equations model SPEEDY
with a machine learning-based (ML-based) model component, while ERA5 reanalyses
provide the presumed true states of the atmosphere. Six-hourly simulated noisy
observations are generated for a 30-year ML training period and a one-year
testing period. These observations are assimilated with a Local Ensemble
Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), and a 10-day deterministic forecast is also
started from each ensemble mean analysis of the testing period. In the first
experiment, the physics-based model provides the background ensemble members
and the 10-day deterministic forecasts. In the other three experiments, the
hybrid model plays the same role as the physics-based model in the first
experiment, but it is trained on a different data set in each experiment. These
training data sets are analyses obtained by using the physics-based model
(second experiment), the hybrid model of the previous experiment (third
experiment), and for comparison, ERA5 reanalyses (fourth experiment). The
results of the experiments show that hybridizing the model can substantially
improve the accuracy of the analyses and forecasts. When the model is trained
on ERA5 reanalyses, the biases of the analyses are negligible and the magnitude
of the flow-dependent part of the analysis errors is greatly reduced. While the
gains in analysis accuracy are distinctly more modest in the other two hybrid
model experiments, the gains in forecast accuracy tend to be larger in those
experiments after 1-3 forecast days. However, these extra gains of forecast
accuracy are achieved, in part, by a modest gradual reduction of the spatial
variability of the forecasts.

Abstract: Light-based synthetic aperture (SA) imaging methods, such as Fourier
Ptychography, have brought breakthrough high-resolution wide-field-of-view
imaging capabilities to microscopy. While these technologies promise similar
improvements in long-range imaging applications, macroscale light-based SA
imaging is significantly more challenging. In this work, we first demonstrate
that speckle noise is particularly problematic for light-based SA systems.
Specifically, we prove that it is fundamentally impossible to perform SA
imaging of fully diffuse scenes if one captures sequential measurements that
suffer from per-measurement-independent speckle. We then develop a snapshot SA
imaging method and aperture-phase-synchronization strategy that can overcome
this limitation and enable SA imaging. Remarkably, we further demonstrate, in
simulation, that speckle can be exploited to recover missing spatial frequency
information in SA imaging systems with distributed, non-overlapping apertures.
That is, one can use speckle to improve the resolution of an SA imaging system.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates the use of plasmonic metasurfaces to enhance the reactivity of photocatalytic reactions through resonance mechanisms, specifically studying the degradation of methylene blue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation stems from the desire to better understand and control resonance-driven photocatalytic reactions, which have wide-ranging applications in fields such as environmental science and energy conversion.

Method: The researchers developed polarization-sensitive metasurfaces made of elliptical Au-TiO2 nanopillars to study the effects of polarization on the reaction rate in the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue. They employed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to monitor the real-time reaction yield.

Result: The results showed that the metasurface could significantly enhance the reaction yield by polarization, with the reaction yield varying from 4.7 to 9.98 percent under electric and magnetic polarizations, respectively. Additionally, they observed a strong correlation between the absorption and the observed reaction yield.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel approach for dynamically controlling the reaction rate in resonance-driven photocatalytic reactions by modulating plasmonic resonances.

Abstract: Plasmonic metasurfaces play a crucial role in resonance-driven photocatalytic
reactions by effectively enhancing reactivity via localized surface plasmon
resonances. Catalytic activity can be selectively modulated by tuning the
strength of plasmonic resonances through two primary non-thermal mechanisms:
near-field enhancement and hot carrier injection, which govern the population
of energetic carrier excited or injected into unoccupied molecular orbitals. We
developed a set of polarization-sensitive metasurfaces consisting of elliptical
Au-TiO2 nanopillars, specifically designed to plasmonically modulate the
reactivity of a model reaction: the photocatalytic degradation of methylene
blue. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy reveals a polarization-dependent
reaction yield in real-time, modulating from 4.7 (transverse electric
polarization) to 9.98 (transverse magnetic polarization) in 10 s period, as
quantified by the integrated area of the 480 cm-1 Raman peak and correlated
with enhanced absorption at 633 nm. The single metasurface configuration
enables continuous tuning of photocatalytic reactivity via active control of
plasmonic resonance strength, as evidenced by the positive correlation between
measured absorption and product yield. This dynamic approach provides a route
to selectively enhance or suppress resonance-driven reactions, which can be
further leveraged to achieve selectivity in multibranch reactions, guiding
product yields toward desired outcomes.

Abstract: High-bandwidth and multi-point acoustic and vibration sensing is a critical
asset for real-time condition monitoring, maintenance, and surveillance
applications. In the case of large scales and harsh environments, optical fiber
distributed sensing has emerged as a compelling alternative to electronic
transducers, featuring lower installation and maintenance costs, along with
compact footprints and enhanced robustness. Yet, current distributed
fiber-optic sensing solutions are typically costly and face a
resolution-bandwidth tradeoff. In this work, we present an alternative
fiber-optic vibration sensing strategy that harnesses a multimodal architecture
combining speckle and polarization interrogation. The experimental results
demonstrate the concept by achieving speckle-based signal source localization
with centimeter-range spatial resolution, while obtaining a high-fidelity
waveform reconstruction over at least 100 Hz-40 kHz bandwidth via the
polarimetric sensing part. Overall, the work establishes a general and
promising blueprint to harness multimodality in fiber sensing and break
single-modality constraints.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors offer transformative potential for high-speed,

hindered by restricted imaging areas, largely due to the compact dimension of
atomic vapor cells and inefficient beam-shaping methodologies. We present a THz

Experimental validation confirms that this system achieves
near-diffraction-limited, high resolution THz imaging at 0.55 THz under ambient
conditions. Furthermore, its capabilities are demonstrated through real-time
visualization of the diffusion dynamics of a deionized water droplet in
anhydrous ethanol. This work not only expands the boundaries of Rydberg atomic
sensors but also establishes a critical foundation for advancing THz imaging
technologies toward into real-world, large-scale applications.

Motivation: The need for real-time, high-capacity sensing in unstructured environments, particularly in applications like acoustic sensing where traditional fiber optic methods fall short due to limitations in frame rates and dynamic range.

Method: The system integrates event-based vision with tensor-based decomposition and machine learning optimization, leveraging multi-point calibration to isolate simultaneous deformations and achieve high bandwidth and low latency.

Result: The system successfully separates signals from four piezoelectric actuators across a broad frequency range and successfully conducts an acoustic sensing proof-of-concept, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: This framework represents a significant advancement in real-time, multi-point sensing, opening new possibilities for applications in complex and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Speckle-based fiber optic sensors are well-known to offer high sensitivity
but are strongly limited on the interrogation side by low camera frame rates
and dynamic range. To address this limitation, we present a novel interrogation
framework that explores event-based vision to achieve high throughput, high
bandwidth, and low-latency speckle analysis of a multimode optical fiber
sensor. In addition, leveraging a tensor-based decomposition of the raw event
streams through multi-point calibration and machine-learning optimization, our
approach also proves capable of isolating simultaneous deformations applied at
distinct points. The experimental results validate the methodology by
separating the signals of four piezoelectric actuators over a 400Hz-20kHz range
with minimal crosstalk applied over varying distances from 3cm to 75cm.
Finally, extending the impact of the work with an acoustic sensing
proof-of-concept, we have coupled the fiber to two plastic enclosures and
recovered separable audio signals between 400 and 1.8 kHz with minimal waveform
distortion. Overall, these results establish event-driven speckle interrogation
as a new versatile platform for real-time, multi-point acoustic sensing and

Conclusion: 研究展示了相位奇点和超振荡照明在纳米尺度测量中的潜力，特别是在复杂结构和动态测量中的应用。

Abstract: It has been seen recently that when probing a nanoscale object to determine,
for example, size or position via light scattering, significant advantage in
measurement precision can be gained from exploiting phase singularities in a
topologically structured incident light field. Here, we demonstrate that this
advantage, derived from the dependence of scattered intensity profiles on
strong local (subwavelength-scale) intensity and phase variations in the
incident field, can be extended towards imaging applications: Analysis of
scattering patterns from arbitrary binary gratings under superoscillatory
illumination successfully resolves feature sizes down to ~{\lambda}/7 in
single-shot measurements (a factor of 1.4x smaller than is achieved with plane
wave illumination), and ~{\lambda}/10.5 in positionally-displaced multi-shot
measurements (which yields no improvement in the plane wave case).
Interestingly, there are circumstances in which more complex objects are better
resolved than simple structures, because interference effects increase the
information content of their scattering patterns.

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems, exhibit
singular spectral responses with extreme sensitivity to external perturbations,
offering new opportunities for precision sensing. In this work, we investigate
the sensing performance of Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) engineered to operate

edges with the EP condition, significant sensitivity enhancement is achieved
under a power interrogation scheme. The optimized sensors demonstrate
sensitivities of $\sim$9.3 dBm/ $^{\circ}$C for temperature and 0.5
dBm/$\mu\epsilon$ for axial strain, representing nearly an order-of-magnitude
improvement over conventional FBG sensors. To address cross-sensitivity between
temperature and strains, a sensitivity matrix-based approach is implemented,
enabling accurate simultaneous detection of multiple perturbations. These
results establish EP-engineered FBGs as a highly effective and versatile

Abstract: Performant on-chip spectrometers are important for advancing sensing
technologies, from environmental monitoring to biomedical diagnostics. As
device footprints approach the scale of the operating wavelength, previously
strategies, including those relying on multiple scattering in diffusive media,
face fundamental accuracy constraints tied to limited optical path lengths.
Here, we demonstrate a wavelength-scale, CMOS-compatible on-chip spectrometer
that overcomes this challenge by exploiting inverse-designed quasinormal modes
in a complex photonic resonator. These modes extend the effective optical path
length beyond the physical device dimensions, producing highly de-correlated
spectral responses. We show that this strategy is theoretically optimal for
minimizing spectral reconstruction error in the presence of measurement noise.
The fabricated spectrometer occupies a lateral footprint of only 3.5 times the
free-space operating wavelength, with a spectral resolution of 10 nm across the
3.59-3.76 micrometer mid-infrared band, which is suitable for molecular
sensing. The design of this miniaturized noise-resistant spectrometer is
readily extensible to other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, paving
the way for lab-on-a-chip devices, chemical sensors, and other applications.

Motivation:  developer likely aimed to provide an accessible tool for researchers and students in X-ray diffraction and optics design.

Method: The DXRD suite uses a graphical interface and dynamical theory to compute diffraction patterns, including multiple beam interactions and advanced techniques like rocking curve simulation.

Result: The program can handle intricate diffraction scenarios, simulate various beam configurations, and aid in optics design and teaching.

Conclusion: DXRD offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for X-ray diffraction applications in optics and research.

Abstract: The DXRD program suite consisting of a series of dynamical-theory programs is
introduced for computing dynamical X-ray diffraction from single crystals. Its
interactive graphic user interfaces (GUIs) allow general users to make
complicated calculations with minimal effort. It can calculate plane-wave
Darwin curves of single crystals (or multiple crystals) for both the Bragg and
Laue cases, including grazing-incidence diffraction and backward diffraction
(with Bragg angles approaching 90 degrees). It is also capable of simulating
rocking curves for divergent incident X-ray beams with finite bandwidths. A
unique capability of DXRD is that it provides, for the first time, a convenient
GUI-based multiple-beam diffraction program that can accurately compute
arbitrary N-beam diffraction of any geometry using a universal 4Nx4N matrix

Conclusion: 威yl迹异常影响了紧致星的结构，参数空间分析和观测数据匹配。

Abstract: We setup an anisotropic compact star model in presence of Weyl ``trace"
anomaly. We derive an exact interior solution which determines the contribution
of the vacuum trace anomaly. We introduce a dimentionless parameter, $\beta$,
to characterize this contribution. Applying appropriate matching conditions
with the exterior solution, we determine the model parameters in terms of the
Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$ and the compactness parameter, $C=\frac{2GM}{c^2
\mathcal{R}}$ where $M$ and $\mathcal{R}$ are the mass and the radius of the
star. We investigate the parameter space $\{\beta, C\}$ and the corresponding
modifications of Buchdahl limit on the maximum compactness. We use
astrophysical observations of mass and radius of the pulsar PSR J0740+6620 to
constrain the Weyl anomaly parameter $\beta$. Also, we investigate the
Mass-Radius diagram with other observational constraints from NICER and
LIGO/Virgo collaboration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In contrast to Newtonian physics, there is no absolute time in relativistic
(Lorentzian) spacetimes. This immediately implies that two twins may, in
general, age at different rates. For this to happen, there must be, of course,
some asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times
are evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent.
Our primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some
lesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and
covariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related
misconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be
perfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and
does not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of
differential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in
the prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering
several pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that
a twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a
stronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get
younger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker
gravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always
returns younger than a geodesic one. Finally, we argue that (iv) in a generic
spacetime, there is no universal correlation between the phenomena of
differential aging and the Doppler effect. Two particularly pedagogical
resources provided are a glossary of relevant terms and supplementary Python
notebooks in a GitHub repository.

### [68] [Black holes in higher-derivative Weyl conformal gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21495)
*Leandro A. Lessa,Caio F. B. Macedo,Manoel M. Ferreira Jr*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Obtained exact static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in a Weyl conformal gauge theory of gravity with scalar-vector-tensor degrees of freedom. The solutions include a Mannheim-Kazanas-type term influenced by the Weyl gauge coupling constant and a residual Rindler acceleration term. The theory can recover Einstein-Hilbert gravity with Horndeski-like terms through spontaneous symmetry breaking and a positive cosmological constant. A higher-derivative term is suppressed by the Planck mass, leaving the Rindler term in the low-energy limit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper extends black hole solutions to conformal gravity theories incorporating scalar-vector-tensor interactions, exploring their implications for gravitational behavior and potential observational signatures.

Method: Considering a quadratic gravitational action built from the Weyl tensor within dilation geometry, the study derives vacuum field equations for gravitational, scalar, and Weyl fields under static, spherically symmetric conditions. It identifies Mannheim-Kazanas-type solutions influenced by Weyl symmetry and demonstrates spontaneous symmetry breaking through scalar field vacuum expectation value, leading to Horndeski-like terms and a modified Rindler term.

Result: The paper identifies Mannheim-Kazanas-type black hole solutions in conformal gravity theories, revealing new terms and interactions. It shows that under certain conditions, the higher-derivative terms are suppressed, leaving the Rindler term dominant in the low-energy limit.

Conclusion: Verification of exact static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in conformal gravity theories with scalar-vector-tensor interactions. Discovery of new terms influenced by Weyl coupling and suppression of higher-derivative terms under Planck mass dominance.

Abstract: We obtain exact black hole solutions for static and spherically symmetric
sources in a Weyl conformal gauge theory of gravity. We consider a quadratic
gravitational action built from the Weyl tensor within a dilation geometry. In
a post-Riemannian formulation, we derive a Weyl conformal action for a
scalar-vector-tensor theory, where the scalar degree of freedom originates from
the high-curvature terms and the vectorial one stems from the Weyl
non-metricity condition. Adopting a static, spherically symmetric geometry, the
vacuum field equations for the gravitational, scalar, and Weyl fields are
obtained. Under these conditions, we find a Mannheim-Kazanas-type black hole
solution, whose Rindler acceleration term depends on the Weyl gauge coupling
constant. Furthermore, we show that the original theory can recover the
Einstein-Hilbert action with a positive cosmological constant plus a
higher-derivative term with Horndeski-like terms through a spontaneous symmetry
breaking triggered by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field. The new
solution in the theory without conformal symmetry presents new terms introduced
by the residual Weyl symmetry corrections. We demonstrate that in a regime
where the Planck mass suppresses the higher-derivative term, the Rindler term
persists in the low-energy limit.

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of $(2+1)$ dimensional BTZ black holes in
the Einstein bumblebee gravity theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz
symmetry caused by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the vector field. We
analyse corrections to black hole thermodynamics, including the non extensive
Barrow entropy, parametrising quantum gravitational corrections to the
Bekenstein Hawking area law. We introduce the York cavity formalism by placing
the black hole in a finite isothermal cavity to obtain a properly defined
canonical ensemble. Here we arrive at the corrected temperature, free energy,
and stability conditions of the BTZ black hole, demonstrating the interplay
among the Lorentz violating effects, the Barrow corrections to Entropy, and the
boundary conditions within the cavity. Our results indicate that the collective
impact of bumblebee dynamics and Barrow entropy significantly alters the phase
structure, equilibrium configurations, and thermal stability of BTZ black
holes. These findings provide insight into the implications of Lorentz
violation and generalised entropy frameworks in lower dimensional quantum
gravity.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We explicitly show that certain 4-dimensional infinitesimal group actions
with 3-dimensional orbits are related by double Wick rotations. In particular,
starting with the symmetries of the spherical/hyperbolic/planar Taub-NUT
spacetimes, one can obtain symmetries of the near-horizon extreme Kerr (NHEK)
geometry or swirling universe by complex analytic continuations of coordinates.
Similarly, the static spherical/hyperbolic/planar symmetries (i.e., symmetries
of the Schwarzschild spacetime and other A-metrics) are mapped to symmetries of
the B-metrics (or Melvin spacetime). All these mappings are theory-independent
-- they constitute relations among symmetries themselves, and, hence among the
classes of symmetry-invariant metrics and electromagnetic field strengths,
rather than among specific solutions. Consequently, finding, e.g., vacuum
Taub-NUT-type solutions in a given gravitational theory automatically yields
vacuum NHEK- or swirling-type solutions of that theory, with a possible
extension to the electromagnetic case.

by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate
reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing
low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze
several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for developing PhenoMoler is to address the gap in molecular generative models that focus primarily on improving drug-target binding affinity and specificity while neglecting system-level phenotypic effects. By leveraging transcriptional profiles as molecule-level readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, PhenoMoler aims to guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner.

Method: PhenoMoler integrates a chemistry large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed drug design. It conditions the generation of molecules by drug-induced differential expression signatures and supports fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization by selectively masking and reconstructing specific substructures, scaffolds, or linkers.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse molecules that are aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness (QED), optimized physicochemical properties, and superior binding affinity to key cancer targets.

Conclusion: PhenoMoler represents a significant advancement in phenotype-guided molecular design, offering a novel framework for structure-controllable and phenotype-aware drug discovery.

Abstract: Current molecular generative models primarily focus on improving drug-target
binding affinity and specificity, often neglecting the system-level phenotypic
effects elicited by compounds. Transcriptional profiles, as molecule-level
readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, offer a powerful opportunity to
guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner. We present PhenoMoler, a
phenotype-guided molecular generation framework that integrates a chemistry
large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed
drug design. By conditioning the generation on drug-induced differential
expression signatures, PhenoMoler explicitly links transcriptional responses to
chemical structure. By selectively masking and reconstructing specific
substructures-scaffolds, side chains, or linkers-PhenoMoler supports
fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse
molecules aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved
drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness

key cancer targets. These findings highlight PhenoMoler's potential for

Abstract: We formulate and implement the core-valence separated multireference
equation-of-motion driven similarity renormalization group method
(CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG) for simulating X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of strongly
correlated molecular systems. This method is numerically robust and
computationally efficient, delivering accurate core-ionization energies with
O(N^4) scaling relative to basis set size N in the EOM step. To ensure rigorous
core intensivity, we propose a simple modification of the ground-state MR-DSRG
formalism. We develop and compare three variants of the theory based on
different approximations of the effective Hamiltonian: two derived from
low-order perturbative methods (DSRG-MRPT2 and DSRG-MRPT3), and one from a
non-perturbative scheme truncated to 1- and 2-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)]. We
benchmark the CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG methods by computing vertical core-ionization
energies for a representative molecular test set and comparing results against
established single-reference and multireference methods. To demonstrate the
applicability of CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG to strongly correlated systems, we compute the
potential energy curves and vibrationally resolved XPS of N2 and CO and the XPS
of ozone. Comparison with experimental data and other high-level theoretical
results shows that all three CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG variants accurately predict
vertical ionization energies, but only DSRG-MRPT3 and MR-LDSRG(2) levels of
theory reliably capture the full dissociation behavior and reproduce the
experimental vibrational structure.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations can reduce the time
and cost of identifying drug candidates from a diverse pool of molecules that
may have been overlooked experimentally. These calculations typically employ
explicit solvents; however these models can be computationally demanding and
challenging to implement due to the difficulties in sampling waters and
managing changes in net charge. To address these challenges, we introduce an
automated parallel Python workflow that adopts the double decoupling method,
incorporating conformational restraints and pairing it with the implicit
generalized Born (GB) solvation model. This approach enhances convergence,
reduces computational costs and avoids the technical issues associated with
explicit solvents. We applied this workflow to a series of 93 host-guest
complexes from the TapRoom database. When pooling all systems, the GB(OBC)
model correlated well with experiment ($R^2 = 0.86$); however, this global
metric obscured much weaker correlations observed within individual hosts ($R^2
= 0.3-0.8$). Systematic errors associated with charged functional groups
(notably ammonium and carboxylates) were also evident, resulting in
root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) greater than 6.12 kcal/mol across all models.
Although the GB models did not achieve reliable accuracy across all systems,
they may be practical when all ligands contain the same functional groups.
Furthermore, a linear correction based on these functional groups reduced RMSE

### [81] [Noise-reduced stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large-scale calculations via tensor hypercontraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21885)
*Chongxiao Zhao,Wenjie Dou*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: A study introducing THC-sRI-CC2, which combines stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) with tensor hypercontraction (THC) to mitigate computational scaling in electronic structure methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate computational methods in quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics.

Method: Combined sRI (reduces CC2 scaling from O(N^5) to O(N^3)) with THC ( HogP reduction for Coulomb terms) to achieve O(N^3) scaling, addressing both energy and derivative costs through hybridization.

Result: THC-sRI-CC2 achieves higher accuracy with reduced stochastic noise compared to conventional sRI-CC2, extending applicability to larger systems and nonadiabatic dynamics.

Conclusion: This approach sets a foundation for developing scalable electronic structure methods, particularly for excited states and large molecular systems, through a general THC-sRI hybrid strategy.

Abstract: The stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) approximation significantly
reduces the computational scaling of CC2 from O(N^5) to O(N^3), where N is a
measure of system size. However, the inherent stochastic noise, while
controllable, can introduce substantial errors in energy derivatives, limiting
its reliability for molecular dynamics simulations. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a noise-reduced approach, termed THC-sRI-CC2, which
synergistically combines the sRI framework with tensor hypercontraction (THC).
In this formulation, the expensive Coulomb term, which scales as O(N^4), is
decoupled via THC, while the time-determining exchange term with an O(N^5) cost
is addressed through the sRI scheme, collectively yielding an overall O(N^3)
scaling. Benchmarks demonstrate that our THC-sRI-CC2 implementation achieves
greater accuracy and markedly reduced stochastic noise compared to conventional
sRI-CC2 with identical computational samplings. The resulting O(N^3) scaling
substantially extends the applicability of CC2 for excited-state energy
calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of large molecular systems.
Furthermore, this work establishes a general THC-sRI hybrid strategy for the
development of reduced-scaling electronic structure methods.

Abstract: Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view
of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the
adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric
performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular
structures comprising four spins. In view of possible large spin quantum
numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of
Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral
structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of
merit.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of aqueous monovalent ions is essential for understanding
the function of biomolecules, such as nucleic acid stability and binding of
charged drugs to protein targets. The 1D and 3D reference interaction site
models (1D- and 3D-RISM) of molecular solvation, as implemented in the
AmberTools molecular modeling suite, are well suited for modeling mixtures of
ionic species around biomolecules across a wide range of concentrations.
However, the available ion model parameters were optimized for molecular
dynamics simulations, not for the RISM framework, which includes a closure
approximation. To address this, we optimized the Lennard-Jones 12-6 model for
monovalent ions for 1D-RISM with the partial series expansion of order 3
closure by fitting to experimental values of ion-oxygen distance (IOD),
hydration free energy (HFE), partial molar volume (PMV) and mean activity
coefficient. The new parameter set demonstrated significant improvement in HFE,
IOD, and mean activity coefficients, whereas no overall change was observed for
the PMV. A second optimization step was necessary to account for the
cation-anion interactions that affect the mean activity coefficients. The new
parameters were validated at finite salt concentrations against experimental
data for 16 ion pairs and showed improved accuracy for 14 of them, while the
results for CsI and CsF were the second best. 1D-RISM results obtained with the
new NaCl parameters were used to calculate the preferential interaction
parameter of the ions around the 24L B-DNA using 3D-RISM. The new parameters
demonstrated better agreement with experiment at physiological and higher
concentrations. At lower concentrations, the results primarily depended on the
closure with little effect from the ion parameters. Overall, the ion parameters
specifically developed for RISM show improved accuracy at infinite dilution and
finite concentrations.

Abstract: We present a multitask machine learning strategy for improving the prediction
of molecular dipole moments by simultaneously training on quantum dipole
magnitudes and inexpensive Mulliken atomic charges. With dipole magnitudes as
the primary target and assuming only scalar dipole values are available without
vector components we examine whether incorporating lower quality labels that do
not quantitatively reproduce the target property can still enhance model
accuracy. Mulliken charges were chosen intentionally as an auxiliary task,
since they lack quantitative accuracy yet encode qualitative physical
information about charge distribution. Our results show that including Mulliken
charges with a small weight in the loss function yields up to a 30% improvement
in dipole prediction accuracy. This multitask approach enables the model to
learn a more physically grounded representation of charge distributions,
thereby improving both the accuracy and consistency of dipole magnitude
predictions. These findings highlight that even auxiliary data of limited
quantitative reliability can provide valuable qualitative physical insights,
ultimately strengthening the predictive power of machine learning models for
molecular properties.

Abstract: Resonant energy transfer (RET), between equal parity 1s65s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$
and 1s66s$^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg levels in helium has been observed in
low-temperature ($\sim80$ mK) collisions with ammonia molecules which undergo
inversion transitions in their X$^1$A$_1$ ground electronic state. This hybrid
Rydberg-atom polar-molecule RET represents a monopole-dipole energy exchange
reaction that necessarily requires spatial overlap of the Rydberg-electron and
molecular wavefunctions. Calculations, explicitly accounting for the
charge-dipole interaction between the Rydberg electron and the molecular
dipole, provide a quantitative explanation of the observations. Total parity is
conserved in the reaction through the mixing of collisional angular momentum in
the atom-molecule complex. This work opens opportunities to expand the toolbox
of hybrid neutral-atom polar-molecule platforms for quantum science with
charge-dipole mediated energy exchange.

Abstract: Microfabricated alkali vapor cells enable the miniaturization of atomic
sensors, but require collective wafer-level integration of complex features. In
many applications, including magnetometers, gyroscopes, magneto-optical traps,
and fluorescence imaging, multiple optical accesses are needed to enhance
performance. Yet, achieving this without compromising manufacturability remains
challenging. In this work, we present a wafer-level fabrication approach that
enables three orthogonal optical pathways in microfabricated alkali vapor
cells, using fully scalable and collective processes. Our method relies on the
thermal reflow of glass preforms, shaped by laser-assisted etching (LAE) and
bonded between silicon frames. The relatively low surface roughness produced by
LAE allows effective reflow, which further smooths the surfaces without
significantly compromising the optical planarity of the windows. This process
results in multi-axis vapor cells featuring embedded, optics-grade lateral
windows. We evaluate the device performance through both single-beam and
dual-beam atomic magnetometry measurements. Magnetic sensitivities better than
200 fT/sqrt(Hz) are demonstrated along each of the three orthogonal axes,
confirming the potential of the approach for tri-axis magnetic field sensing at
sub-picotesla resolution. This fabrication strategy opens new perspectives for
versatile, high-performance atomic sensors, fully compatible with wafer-level
integration and mass production.

TL;DR: This paper discusses advances in single-ion optical clocks, highlighting methods to reduce timing uncertainties by utilizing cooling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the stability and accuracy of atomic clocks is crucial for various applications, including fundamental physics and timekeeping systems.

Method: The authors employed sympathetic ground-state cooling using electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) with a co-trapped ion to reduce motional heating.

Result: By cooling an Al ion using a Ca cooling light, the motional uncertainty decreased significantly to $10^{-19}$, achieving faster interrogation times with improved precision.

Conclusion: This technique offers a promising approach to enhance the performance of ion clocks, potentially applicable to other ion systems.

Abstract: Single ion optical clocks have shown systematic frequency uncertainties below
$10^{-18}$, but typically require more than one week of averaging to achieve a
corresponding statistical uncertainty. This time can be reduced with longer
probe times, but comes at the cost of a higher time-dilation shift due to
motional heating of the ions in the trap. We show that sympathetic ground-state
cooling using electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) of an \Al clock
ion via a co-trapped \Ca ion during clock interrogation suppresses the heating
of the ions. \Al can be kept close to the motional ground state, independent
from the chosen interrogation time, at a relative time dilation shift of
$(-1.69\pm0.20)\times10^{-18}$. The \Ca cooling light introduces an additional
light shift on the \Al clock transition of $(-9.27\pm 1.03)\times10^{-18}$. We
project that the uncertainty of this light shift can be further reduced by
nearly an order of magnitude. This sympathetic cooling enables seconds of
interrogation time with $10^{-19}$ motional and cooling laser-induced
uncertainties for \Al and can be employed in other ion clocks as well.

Abstract: We report on measurements of the mechanical vibrations of the fundamental
mode of resonant capacitive transducers, consisting of parallel plates at
different gaps (10 - 26 $\mu$m). Resonant frequency data were taken vs the
electric field at constant charge, at various temperatures and different
configurations. All measurements exhibited unexpectedly large tuning, caused by
an additional, unpredicted attractive force. Such force has a divergent
behaviour characterized by a critical electrical field and start to diverge
long before the critical point. Many known physical mechanisms have been
considered to explain this force, but all of them had to be discarded. Thus, we
turn to non-conventional physical mechanisms and suggest that vacuum
fluctuations inside the gap could be a possible cause of this anomalous force.

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported chiral time-reversal broken
superconductivity in $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene for $n = 4,5, 6$.
Introducing a moir\'e potential by alignement with a hexagonal boron nitride
substrate suppresses the superconductivity but leads instead to various
fractional quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Motivated by these observations,
we consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi
liquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of
attractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the
superconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive
interactions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is
stable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition
between the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that
generically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against
superconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor
goes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions.
With stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian
paired quantum Hall state.

Abstract: Magnetic phases with quantum entanglement are often expressed in terms of
parton wavefunctions. Relatively few examples are known where wavefunctions can
be directly written down in the spin basis. In this article, we consider the
spin-$S$ Kitaev model in one dimension. For $S=1/2$, its eigenstates can be
written using a Jordan-Wigner fermionic representation. Here, we present ground
state wavefunctions for any $S$ directly in the spin basis. The states we
propose are valence bond arrangements, with bonds having singlet or triplet
character for $S=1/2$. For $S>1/2$, we use bond-states that serve as analogues
of singlets and triplets. We establish the validity of our wavefunctions using
a perturbative approach starting from an anisotropic limit, with key features
surviving to all orders in perturbation theory. For half-integer $S$ and
periodic boundaries, we have exponential ground state degeneracy. The ground
states have topological character, with an even number of `triplets' superposed
on a background of `singlets'. For integer $S$, a unique ground state emerges,
composed purely of `triplets'. Our spin-basis wavefunctions, while not exact,
capture the dominant weight of the ground state(s). We obtain good agreement
against exact diagonalization wavefunctions and Jordan-Wigner spectra.

TL;DR: Optical conductivity of doped Mott insulators can be manipulated by tuning pump pulses to different absorption regions, leading to distinct effects on the Drude weight and mid-IR spectral weight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the optical properties of doped Mott insulators is crucial for advancing the field of condensed matter physics, particularly in the study of cuprate materials and their potential applications in spintronics.

Method: The study employs a combination of a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg t-J ladder, along with the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group method, to calculate the optical conductivity after pump.

Result: Pulse tuning to the Drude region decreases the Drude weight while slightly enhancing the mid-IR spectral weight, but this enhancement weakens with increasing pulse intensity. Conversely, a mid-IR-tuned pulse directly affects the Drude weight without altering the mid-IR spectral weight. The mid-IR absorption is attributed to magnetic excitations not directly coupling to photons.

Conclusion: The research suggests that controlling pump pulses can selectively manipulate optical properties in doped Mott insulators, providing a new avenue for studying electron correlations and their interplay with photon interactions. The findings can be experimentally verified in cuprate materials using ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to observe these effects.

Abstract: We investigate changes in the optical conductivity of doped Mott insulators
by tuning ultrashort pump pulses to target either the Drude or low-energy
absorption regions. Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg
t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle
electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight,
accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral
weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases.
In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude
weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from
magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions
can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to
cuprate materials.

Abstract: The nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a powerful tool to
study the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated lattice systems, but its
applicability to realistic system sizes and long timescales is limited by
unfavorable memory scaling. While compressed representations, such as the
recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) format, alleviate the memory
bottleneck, the efficiency of QTT-NEGF calculations is hindered by poor
initializations and slow or unstable convergence of globally updated
self-consistent iterations. Here, we introduce a predictor-corrector solver for
QTT-NEGF simulations that combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
extrapolation with the recently proposed causality-preserving
block-time-stepping updates. The DMD predictor supplies accurate initial
guesses that reduce the iteration count of the calculation, while the
block-time-stepping correction ensures stable convergence even for long
propagation intervals. Applying this method to the Hubbard model on a $32\times
32$ lattice within the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation, we demonstrate stable
propagation up to times of $t_\mathrm{max}=512$ inverse hoppings, surpassing
the capabilities of both matrix-based implementations and previous QTT solvers.
Our contribution is twofold. (i) We integrate tensor dynamic mode decomposition
with the QTT representation, which establishes a general framework that is not
limited to NEGFs. (ii) We demonstrate its practical benefits in NEGF
simulations, where it enables stable and efficient access to unprecedented
timescales at high momentum resolution, thereby advancing controlled studies of
long-time dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states in correlated lattice
systems.

Abstract: Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy in the range of 1.2 - 3.7 eV
was studied for La1-xKxMnO3 (x = 0.05 - 0.18) epitaxial films over a wide
temperature range. The thin films were grown using a two-step procedure:
deposition of LaxMnO3-{\delta} and potassium K+ incorporation into the films
via isopiestic annealing. The temperature behavior of the MCD effect in
different spectral regions was analyzed alongside the temperature dependences
of magnetization, resistivity, and magnetoresistance of the films. It was found
that the MCD signal is sensitive not only to the magnetic but also to the
charge sublattice of the material. Accordingly, a correlation between the
magneto-optical and magnetoresistive responses of the system was identified.
These findings underscore the high information content of MCD spectroscopy for
investigating the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of strongly
correlated magnetic oxides. The ground and excited electronic states in the
La1-xKxMnO3 films were identified, and the obtained data were compared with
magneto-optical data for divalent - doped and lanthanum-deficient manganite
films. Good agreement was observed, indicating the universality of the
electronic structure and the shared mechanisms underlying the observed effects
in such materials. These results broaden the understanding of the band
structure in manganites and provide a solid foundation for its theoretical
description.

Abstract: An effective continuum theory is constructed for the topological phase
transition of excitons in quasi-two-dimensional systems. These topological
excitons crucially determine the optoelectronic properties, because of their
larger binding energies in 2D as well as their topologically enhanced exciton
transport. The core idea of this letter is, that the essential physics
determining the topological invariants across the phase transition is localized
near $N$-fold band-crossing points (BCPs) in the interaction-induced exciton
band structure. The construction of the continuum theory around these BCPs
needs only the information of exciton states that build up these BCPs at both
$\mathbf{Q}=0$ and finite $\mathbf{Q}$ points, and not the numerically
challenging solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation over the full exciton
Brillouin zone. This theory applies to systems with and without spin
conservation. Our theory is illustrated in two specific examples: the
transition metal dichalcogenide twisted bilayer systems and the
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. These results offer a promising route toward
studying complex systems, such as the room-temperature quantum spin Hall system
Bismuthene (Bi/SiC) and other twisted bilayer systems.

Abstract: The $d$-wave pairing symmetry has long been considered a defining feature of
high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. In this work, we reveal that
$s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave
state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels
($\delta\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation.
This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important
role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our
findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson
tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into
the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.

Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that
nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical
properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These
amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic
plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking
centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the
thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B),
and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and
these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our
findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is
strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface
quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like
second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of
$\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$
pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline

Abstract: In this letter, we present a kilovolt-class \b{eta}-Ga2O3 vertical trench
Schottky barrier diode with a field plate incorporating narrow fin width (Wfin)
structures of sub-micron dimensions. We used a nanolaminate dielectric
comprising a stack of multiple thin TiO2 and Al2O3 layers as RESURF dielectric
and for field plate edge termination. Both Wfin of 200 nm and 500 nm
demonstrate excellent on-state performance with specific on-resistance (Ron,sp)
of 9.8-12 mohmcm2, and 10^10 rectification ratio. A self-aligned photoresist
planarization and etch-back process was employed to expose the top of the fins
for Schottky contact formation, eliminating critical lithographic alignment
challenges in sub-micron scale processing. We achieved a breakdown of 2.34 kV
with very low leakage currents before catastrophic breakdown. The measured
breakdown voltage is limited by dielectric breakdown at the trench bottom
corner as verified by metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) test structure. TCAD
simulation shows a reduced electric field at the surface of the
metal-semiconductor junction due to the RESURF effect, resulting in very low
reverse leakage before breakdown. The parallel plane electric field in the
\b{eta} -Ga2O3 is extracted to be 3.8 MV/cm from TCAD simulations using
accurately extracted drift layer doping profile from high voltage CV
measurements. A power figure of merit of 0.867 GW/cm2(0.56 GW/cm2 with current
spreading) was calculated. Enhanced RESURF by integration of high-k dielectrics
with self-aligned photoresist planarization, offers a promising pathway towards
high figure of merit, low leakage high-performance vertical devices.

Abstract: The oxidation of pure W and the sublimation of W oxide have been investigated
to assess their impact on the lifecycle of a fusion power plant. Pure W has
been oxidised at temperatures between 400 and 1050C and for durations ranging
between 1 and 70 h. The formation of voids and cracks has been observed at
temperatures above 600C, leading to the formation of dust or oxide spalling,
which could be problematic in maintenance and waste-handling scenarios of a
fusion power plant. Preferential oxidation taking place at the edge of the
specimen was characterised, and its impact is discussed in relation to
component design. Characterisation using electron microscopy and Raman
spectroscopy revealed that the oxide scale is formed of three main layers: the
inner layer is 30-50 nm thick WO2 oxide, the middle layer is a 10-20 um of
WO_2.72 and the outer layer is formed of WO2.9/WO3 phases - whose thickness
varies according to the total thickness of the oxide scale. The observed
microstructure is discussed in relation to the parabolic-to-linear kinetics and
its potential impact on tritium permeation and detritiation efficiency.

Abstract: Periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) crystals are the
fundamental building block for highly-efficient quantum light sources and
frequency converters. The efficiency of these devices is strongly dependent on
the interaction length between the light and the nonlinear material, scaling
quadratically with this parameter. Nevertheless, the fabrication of long,
continuously poled areas in TFLN remains challenging, the length of
continuously poled areas rarely exceeds 10 mm. In this work, we demonstrate a
significant progress in this field achieving the periodic poling of continuous
poled areas of 70 mm length with a 3 microns poling period and a close to 50 %
duty cycle. We compare two poling electrode design approaches to fabricate
long, continuous poled areas. The first approach involves the poling of a
single, continuous 70 mm long electrode. The second utilize a segmented
approach including the poling of more than 20 individual sections forming
together a 70 mm long poling area with no stitching errors. While the
continuous electrode allows for faster fabrication, the segmented approach
allows to individually optimize the poling resulting in less duty cycle
variation. A detailed analysis of the periodic poling results reveals that the
results of both are consistent with previously reported poling outcomes for
shorter devices. Thus, we demonstrate wafer-scale periodic poling exceeding
chiplet-size without any loss in the periodic poling quality. Our work presents
a key step towards highly-efficient, narrowbandwidth and low-pump power
nonlinear optical devices.

we study the renormalization under this flow of the $A/4G$ term in the

Uglum. Specifically, given a 'UV' code with two-sided recovery and
appropriately flat entanglement spectrum together with a set of 'seed' states
in the UV code, we explicitly construct an 'IR' code with corresponding
properties which contains the given seed states and is of minimal size in a

Motivation: 理解黑洞周围物质扰动的性质及其与时空结构的相互作用是理论物理学的重要课题，通过非交换规范场理论的研究有助于揭示复杂的对称性破坏和量子效应。

Method: 研究采用了具有内生非交换对称性的经典引力背景的半经典理论，构建了对应的作用量functional，并通过求解引力背景下的扰动方程来确定QNM谱。

Result: 主要发现是由于非交换性导致的对称性破缺，使得总角动量投影发生分离。这意味着在具有非交换性的情况下，QNM的分裂是可预测的且带状结构不再是单一的。

Conclusion: 通过以上的研究和分析，我们已经有了关于镜面引力和非交换规范场对QNM谱的影响和分裂的清晰结论。这些结果为理解非交换量子场论在强场环境（如黑洞周围）中的行为提供了理论依据，同时也为后续实验或数值模拟提供了基础和指导。

Abstract: Twisted Abelian gauge theory coupled to a noncommutative (NC) Dirac field is
studied in order to infer
  the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the fermion matter perturbations in
the vicinity of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole. The action functional
of the theory is invariant under the truncated NC local $U(1)_{\star}$ gauge
transformations that keep the gravitational background intact. The latter,
being a classical gravitational background unaffected by the
  NC local gauge transformations, makes the theory semiclassical. The most
prominent feature of the QNM spectrum is the splitting in the total angular
momentum projection due to the noncommutativity induced $SO(3) \rightarrow
U(1)$ symmetry breaking pattern.

Abstract: In the thin wall approximation, we study a class of asymptotically AdS black
holes which contain a spherically symmetric vacuum bubble with a different
(positive or negative) cosmological constant. Collapsing, expanding, and static
bubble solutions are considered. Among these, expanding bubbles with positive
cosmological constant can provide a way to apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to
describe the physics of an expanding universe. We systematically study the
causal structure of the solutions as a function of the cosmological constant,
the mass of the black hole, and the tension of the bubble. We then compute the
holographic entanglement entropy for a class of boundary subregions using
extremal codimension-two surfaces as a probe. For collapsing bubbles, we find
examples in which the entanglement entropy also explores the geometry inside
the black hole bifurcation surface. As a complementary way to probe the
interior of the bubble, we investigate almost-null radial geodesics related to
the bulk-cone singularities of boundary two-point correlators. While the
bulk-cone singularities for collapsing and expanding bubbles are consistent
with thermalization at late time, static bubbles violate thermalization and
exhibit properties similar to those of scar states.

Abstract: We analyze the quantum dynamics of a relativistic homogeneous superfluid in a
complex scalar field theory. Unlike zero-charge condensates, which undergo
quantum evaporation due to internal number-changing processes, we show that
$U(1)$ superfluids preserve their internal coherence indefinitely in this
theory. In particular, although not Hamiltonian eigenstates, these
configurations are stable in the full quantum theory to all orders in
perturbation theory. This is demonstrated by explicitly constructing the
corresponding quantum state and studying its dynamics. Crucially, maintaining
stability requires the quantum state to go beyond a naive coherent-state
construction: specific non-Gaussian corrections are essential for having a
stationary state. The resulting state is identified as the interacting vacuum
of the superfluid fluctuations, which also serves as the ground state of the
modified Hamiltonian $\hat{{H}}-\mu \hat{Q}$, with $\mu$ the full-fledged
quantum chemical potential and $\hat{Q}$ the $U(1)$ charge. Finally, we check
that the phonon mode remains gapless once one-loop corrections are included,
confirming the robustness of the Goldstone theorem beyond the semiclassical
regime, even in systems with a spontaneously broken Lorentz symmetry.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) in
the language of analytic number theory. Attached to the torus partition
function of every two-dimensional CFT is a self-dual, degree-4 $L$-function of
root number $\varepsilon=1$, with a universal gamma factor determined by
$SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and local conformal invariance. Due to the richness of CFT
operator spectra, these are not, in general, standard $L$-functions. We
explicate their analytic structure, exploring the interplay of the Hadamard
product over non-trivial zeros with the generalized Dirichlet series over CFT
scalar primary conformal dimensions. We derive a zero sum rule in terms of the
spectrum, and a global zero density bound in terms of the spectral gap.
Convergence of the series representation implies square root cancellation of
the degeneracies; we relate this to random matrix behavior of high-energy level
spacings. Random matrix universality of the CFT implies "Riemann zeta
universality" of the $L$-function: an average relation between the $L$-function
on the critical line and Riemann zeta on the 1-line. This in turn yields a
subconvexity bound. For a compact free boson, the $L$-function is a product of
Riemann zeta functions times an analytic factor. Extensions to correlator
$L$-functions and spinning spectra are briefly discussed.
  In the course of this work, we are led to sharpen the notion of random matrix
universality in two-dimensional CFTs. We formulate a precise version of the
following standalone conjecture, logically independent of $L$-functions: in
unitary, compact Virasoro CFTs with central charge $c>1$, fixed-spin primary
spectra at high energy are asymptotically simple, with random extreme gap
statistics.

Abstract: We discuss the notion of string entanglement in string theory, which aims to
study entanglement between worldsheet Hilbert spaces rather than entanglement
between spacetime Hilbert spaces defined on a time slice in spacetime. Applying
this framework to the FZZ duality and its extension to a three-dimensional
black hole, we argue that the thermal entropy of 2d and 3d black holes is
accounted for by the string entanglement entropy between folded strings arising
in the dual sine-Liouville CFT. We compute this via a worldsheet replica method
and show that it decomposes into two parts, which we call the vertex operator
contribution and the replica contribution. The former can be evaluated
analytically and is shown to coincide with the black hole thermal entropies in
the low temperature limit in large D dimensions. Although a computation of the
latter is left as an open problem, we present evidence that it captures the
remaining portion of the black hole entropy.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic framework for analyzing the analytic properties of finite Feynman integrals involving multiple polylogarithms. The authors introduce the concept of 'touching configurations' which classify logarithmic singularities of the integral on its principal branch. These singularities are linked to the first entries of the integral's symbol and generate 'elementary discontinuities,' which are derived through a bi-projection operation. Across logarithmic branch cuts, discontinuities emerge as linear combinations of these elementary discontinuities. The framework is demonstrated at one loop for a massless hexagon and a massless box with two massive and two massless propagators. It can be extended to higher-loop integrals. This analysis offers a comprehensive approach to understanding the structure of Feynman integrals and their symbols.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of Feynman integrals and their analytic properties is fundamental in quantum field theory, particularly in the computation of scattering amplitudes. Understanding the symbol and discontinuities of these integrals is crucial for simplifying complex calculations and exposing their mathematical structure. This paper provides a new framework to systematically analyze these properties, extending previous work on multiple polylogarithms and diverging integrals. The introduction of touching configurations and bi-projection operations represents a novel approach that could lead to significant advances in the field.

Method: The authors employ a systematic approach by first defining logarithmic singularities based on 'touching configurations' derived from Feynman parameters. They introduce the symbol of the integral and the concept of elementary discontinuities. The bi-projection operation is used to derive these discontinuities, and the recursive application of this method allows for the construction of the entire integral's symbol. The presentation includes detailed examples at one loop, which are solved explicitly to illustrate the method.

Result: The paper successfully develops a framework for analyzing the analytic properties of finite Feynman integrals involving multiple polylogarithms. By introducing the 'touching configurations' classification, the authors demonstrate a method to compute the integral's symbol and discontinuities. The one-loop examples serve as concrete proofs of the framework's effectiveness, showing how it can be applied to compute and understand the structure of Feynman integrals. The work lays a solid foundation for future studies on higher-loop integrals and their associated symbols.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking framework for the systematic analysis of analytic properties of finite Feynman integrals involving multiple polylogarithms. By introducing touching configurations and bi-projection operations, the authors provide a comprehensive method to compute the symbols and discontinuities of such integrals. The analysis, supported by explicit one-loop examples, suggests broad applicability in quantum field theory, particularly in loop integral computations, and opens the door for extending these results to higher-loop scenarios.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic framework for the analysis of analytic properties of
finite Feynman integrals that are multiple polylogarithms. Based on the Feynman
parameter representation in complex projective space, we make a complete
classification of logarithmic singularities of the integral on its principal
branch, by what we call touching configurations -- a geometric relationship
between the integrand singularity and linear subspaces tied to boundary
elements of the integral contour. These on the one hand indicate first entries
of the symbol of the integral, and on the other hand induce a special set of
new integrals that we call elementary discontinuities. These elementary
discontinuities are derived through an operation called bi-projection, and
actual discontinuities of the integral across logarithmic branch cuts are their
linear combinations. By recursively applying the same analysis to the induced
integrals one can fully construct the symbol of the original integral. We
explicitly show how this analysis works at one loop in a massless hexagon and a
box with two massive and two massless loop propagators. This framework may
naturally extend to higher-loop integrals.

Abstract: The Schwinger model is a model of a two-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory
coupled to a Dirac fermion. It is an interesting model that exhibits phenomena
like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. In this paper, we study the
massless Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model on a squashed sphere, $S^2_b$.
These models are examples of interacting non-supersymmetric theories where the
exact computations in the coupling parameter are possible. Squashing provides a
smooth deformation of the metric away from the spherical geometry. We compute
the partition function, and the expectation value of the Wilson loop and the
fermion condensate exactly in the Schwinger and Schwinger-Thirring model as a
function of the squashing parameter and the coupling constant. We then obtain
variations in these quantities in response to the squashing deformation. These
contain information about correlation functions involving the energy-momentum
tensor. We evaluate these variations in the first order in the squashing
parameter and exactly in the coupling constant.

Abstract: We consider the Courant-Hilbert (CH) construction of integrable deformations
of a two-dimensional principal chiral model (2D PCM) in the context of the
four-dimensional Chern-Simons (4D CS) theory. According to this construction,
an integrable deformation of 2D PCM is characterized by a boundary function. As
a result, the master formula obtained from the 4D CS theory should be corrected
by the trace of the energy-momentum tensor so as to support the CH
construction. We present some examples of deformation including the
$T\bar{T}$-deformation, the root $T\bar{T}$-deformation, the two-parameter
mixed deformation, and a logarithmic deformation. Finally, we discuss some

Method: 通过构建在特定 backgrounds 下的Weyl等价度量，运用纠缠熵的定义和计算技巧，导出了显式的纠缠哈密顿量，并通过局域和双局域项的分析比较了理论预测与数值结果的一致性。

Result: 获得的显式表达式在模型与Rainbow链的连续极限和晶格链之间实现了高度一致的对比，证实了计算方法的正确性和有效性，提供了纠缠熵在复杂空间背景下的清晰描述。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解量子场论中的纠缠结构及其在不同几何背景下的行为提供了新的分析工具，同时为量子引力和共形场论中的相关问题提供了有用的理论框架。

Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian of an interval for the massless Dirac
field in an inhomogeneous background on a segment where the same boundary
condition at both its endpoints is imposed, and in its ground state. We focus
on a class of metrics that are Weyl equivalent to the flat metric through a
Weyl factor that depends only on the spatial coordinate. The explicit form of
the entanglement Hamiltonian is written as the sum of a local and a bilocal
term. The weight function of the local term allows us to study a contour
function for the entanglement entropies. For the model obtained from the
continuum limit of the rainbow chain, the analytic expressions are compared
with exact numerical results from the lattice, showing an excellent agreement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着弦理论和共形场理论（CFTs）的快速发展，探索带有缺陷或边界条件的系统成为理论物理学家的一个重要研究方向。Understanding such systems not only advances our knowledge of fundamental physics but also has potential implications in areas like condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. 这个研究旨在通过构造holographic模型来更好地理解带有高维缺陷的CFTs，特别是在AdS/BCFT框架下的行为，尤其是缺陷相关的物理量如熵、自由能和C函数的行为。

Method: 该论文采用holographic方法，即通过研究反德Sitter（AdS）空间中带有边界条件的末日 brane配置来模拟具有高维缺陷的CFTs。具体来说，作者将末日 brane 悬挂在其在渐近AdS边界上的缺陷，并施加了Dirichlet边界条件来约束度量在该平面上的行为。通过计算该模型中的缺陷熵和缺陷自由能，并引入C函数来研究系统的RG流行为，得出了相关的结论。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构造带有高维缺陷的holographic模型，深入探讨了DCFTs中的缺陷熵、自由能以及C函数的行为。结果表明，在该模型中缺陷C定理成立且C函数保持非负，为理解此类理论和研究相关的物理现象提供了新的视角和理论依据。下一步的工作可能包括扩展该模型到更高维缺陷或引入其他相互作用，以进一步丰富关于DCFTs的知识。

Abstract: We construct a holographic model of defect conformal field theories (DCFTs)
with defects of codimension greater than one. Our construction generalizes the
AdS/BCFT model by anchoring the end-of-the-world brane on defects at the
asymptotic AdS boundary and imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions for the
metric on the brane. We compute the defect entropy and defect free energy and
show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-function is always non-negative. We further
study holographic defect-localized RG flows triggered by a localized scalar
field on the brane and show that the defect $\mathcal{C}$-theorem holds. We
also verify that our model reproduces the expected forms of correlation
functions in DCFTs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The double copy relates scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in
non-abelian gauge theories and gravity. As such, it is usually expressed in the
conventional second-order formalisms in both theories corresponding to standard
Yang-Mills theory, and the Einstein--Hilbert action in General Relativity. In
this paper, we instead consider alternative formulations of gravity, which are
known to terminate at finite order in the coupling at Lagrangian level. We
focus in particular on the Chern--Simons--Witten (CSW) formulation in 2+1
dimensions, and argue that the double copy then becomes a doppelg\"{a}nger
relationship between gauge theory and gravity, allowing straightforward
replacement of generators and structure constants in both theories. We show how
explicit (multiple) static point-source solutions can be mapped in the two
approaches, and use the CSW formalism to examine when double copies are
expected to be possible, and when not. In addition, we present an explicit
double copy between the Wong equations for colour charges, and the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations for spinning particles, that extends also
to higher dimensions.

Conclusion: 该效应可能在引力波实验和冷boson实验中被探测到，提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole
affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift
memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high
efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable
manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in
Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although
degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The
strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which
measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the
information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of
a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some
master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as
on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect
must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial
black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We
also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a
table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.

Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with
three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in
simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the
design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues
to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a
significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different
operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort
spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more
of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated
sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development
cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using
real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal
operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing
that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize
operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device
expert.

TL;DR: A paper proposes an improved algorithm for cluster counting in gaseous detectors to improve particle identification. The authors present simulation results showing superior resolution compared to dE/dx, validate the method with beam tests at CERN, and address challenges through modern computational techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle identification in gaseous detectors relies on dE/dx, but its resolution is limited by energy deposition uncertainties. The paper seeks to improve resolution by introducing the dN/dx method using cluster counting.

Method: The paper introduces a novel algorithm for cluster counting using dN/dx, employs modern computational techniques, and validates it with simulation studies in Garfield++ and Geant4. Additionally, experimental validation is conducted using a muon beam and drift tubes of different configurations.

Result: Simulation studies indicate that dN/dx achieves twice the resolution of dE/dx in helium-based drift chambers. Experimental tests at CERN with various helium gas mixtures, gas gains, and wire orientations confirm the effectiveness of the new algorithms.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the challenges in cluster counting by proposing novel algorithms and demonstrates superior resolution capabilities compared to dE/dx using both simulation and experimental results.

Abstract: Particle identification in gaseous detectors traditionally relies on energy
loss measurements (dE/dx); however, uncertainties in total energy deposition
limit its resolution. The cluster counting technique (dN/dx) offers an
alternative approach by exploiting the Poisson-distributed nature of primary
ionization, providing a statistically robust method for mass determination.
Simulation studies with Garfield++ and Geant4 indicate that dN/dx can achieve
twice the resolution of dE/dx in helium-based drift chambers. However,
experimental implementation is challenging due to signal overlap in the time
domain, complicating the identification of electron peaks and ionization
clusters. This paper presents novel algorithms and modern computational
techniques to address these challenges, facilitating accurate cluster
recognition in experimental data. The effectiveness of these algorithms is
validated through four beam tests conducted at CERN, utilizing various helium
gas mixtures, gas gains, and wire orientations relative to ionizing tracks. The
experiments employ a muon beam (1 GeV/c to 180 GeV/c) with drift tubes of
different sizes and sense wire diameters. The analysis explores the Poisson
nature of cluster formation, evaluates the performance of different clustering
algorithms, and examines the dependence of counting efficiency on the beam
particle impact parameter. Furthermore, a comparative study of the resolution
achieved using dN/dx and dE/dx is presented.

Motivation: Understanding the radiopurity of NaI(Tl) crystals is crucial for validating dark matter experiments like DAMA/LIBRA.

Method: Purification method of Ingot#85 used to produce Ingot#94 crystals and conducted annual modulation search by PICOLON.

Result: Demonstrated long-term stability of radiopurity in Ingot#94 crystals and successful annual modulation search.

Conclusion: Stabilized NaI(Tl) crystals with high radiopurity and consistent performance can effectively verify dark matter signals in future experiments.

Abstract: The dark matter observation claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has been a
long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. NaI(Tl) crystals
with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate
verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by
the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment
conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using
highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85)
reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has
stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with
long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the
long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant
advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using
NaI(Tl) crystal. In this paper, we present the background stability of purity
in the Ingot#94 NaI(Tl) detector, which was produced using the Ingot#85
purification method, along with the first annual modulation search conducted by
the PICOLON experiment.

TL;DR: LMDp is a metal additive manufacturing technique that can be used for repairing metal components or producing intricate parts. X-ray imaging has been shown to be effective for in-situ non-destructive testing of melt pools, despite the challenges of low contrast and polychromatic X-ray beams.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling melt pool dynamics is crucial for high-quality and defect-free parts in LMDp. Non-destructive testing using X-ray imaging holds great promise for real-time monitoring during manufacturing, but its application has been hindered by challenges such as low contrast and polychromatic X-ray beams.

Method: The method used in the paper involves establishing an experimental setup with a movable X-ray source, detector, and lead shielding. Traditional image analysis methods were found ineffective due to low contrast, so neural networks trained on simulated data (thermal and X-ray) were employed. The architecture inspired by VGG16 was selected for its potential, demonstrating promising results in identifying the melt pool in low-contrast radioscopic images.

Result: The study successfully demonstrated the application of X-ray imaging in in-situ non-destructive testing for LMDp. Neural networks optimized for low-contrast images showed promising results, confirming the potential for real-time monitoring and control of melt pool dynamics in industrial additive manufacturing processes.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the significance of non-destructive testing for monitoring and controlling melt pool behavior in LMDp. It also outlines the potential of using X-ray imaging combined with machine learning for real-time process monitoring in industrial additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Laser Metal Deposition with Powder (LMDp) is an additive manufacturing
technique used for repairing metal components or producing parts with intricate
geometries. However, a comprehensive understanding of the melt pool dynamics,
which significantly influences the final properties of LMDp-fabricated parts,
remains limited. Non-destructive testing is highly valuable for conducting
in-situ controls during manufacturing. X-ray imaging offers the ability to
penetrate metallic parts and detect defects such as porosity. In the context of
additive manufacturing, X-rays can be employed to visualize the shape of the
melt pool during the fabrication process. The contrast between the liquid and
solid phases, due to their density differences, should be observable in the
radioscopy images. The experimental setup required to perform such a test on an
industrial additive manufacturing installation consists of a movable X-ray
source that produces polychromatic beams, a detector, and extensive lead
shielding to ensure X-ray safety. In-situ observations of the melt pool were
conducted during the deposition of ten successive layers of stainless steel
316L (SS316L). The polychromatic nature of the X-ray beam, however, rendered
traditional image analysis methods ineffective for detecting contrast
variations. To address this challenge, neural networks trained on simulated
data (thermal and X-ray) were employed, providing a solution to identify the
melt pool in low-contrast radioscopic images. The architecture inspired by
VGG16 demonstrated promising results, confirming the potential for in-situ
non-destructive testing using X-ray imaging in industrial additive
manufacturing processes.

Abstract: Coherent low-energy electrons have been demonstrated as a practical tool for

electrons exhibit unique properties: low radiation damage to biological
molecules and high sensitivity to the local potentials. In this study, we
outline the conditions at which single isolated charge-free atoms can be imaged
by low-energy electron holography. A single atom produces an interference
pattern consisting of concentric fringes of finite diameter and of very weak
intensity. The diffraction angle theta, determined as the first minimum of the
concentric rings interference pattern, exhibits similar dependency on the
source-to-sample distance zs as sin(theta) ~ 0.3/sqrt(zs) for electrons of
different energies (50, 100 and 200 eV) and scattered off different elements
(Li, C, and Cs). The results are compared to the recently reported experimental
holograms of alkali atoms intercalated into bilayer graphene and adsorbed on
top of graphene.

Abstract: The interaction between electron spin and molecular chirality plays a
fundamental role in quantum phenomena, with significant implications for
spintronics and quantum computing. The chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a
particular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its
underlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of
spin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin
scattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly
due to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes
typically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic
circular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene
electrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in
both the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter
scenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current
amplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or
current flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers
into graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial
spin distribution in chiral devices. This work establishes a new paradigm for
investigating spin-dependent phenomena in chiral materials and opens avenues
for developing chirality-based spintronic and quantum devices.

Abstract: This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high
overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp
resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency
range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses
significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models
the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate
(a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and
critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which
imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use
of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and
sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical
device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband
datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously
fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1
GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling
coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by
leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be
easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes,
multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting
measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various
perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be
useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and
sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper examines the fabrication and transport properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer graphene (BLG) moiré superlattices, highlighting their unique electronic behavior under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of moiré superlattices is driven by their potential for creating novel electronic properties, such as energy gaps at the charge neutrality point, which could have implications for electronics and quantum materials.

Method: The research employs a dual-gated device structure to independently control the perpendicular electric field and carrier density, enabling systematic exploration of the energy-band topology.

Result: The investigation reveals that hBN/BLG moiré superlattices exhibit a Schuh-type energy gap at the charge neutrality point without an applied electric field. This gap is tunable by applying an electric field, similar to other grouped materials like rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The superlattices also exhibit a narrow energy band with a van Hove singularity.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the rich and diverse physics of hBN/BLG moiré superlattices, offering new avenues for fundamental research and potential applications in electronic devices.

Abstract: We review the fabrication and transport characterization of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN)/Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) moir\'e superlattices. Due to the
moir\'e effect, the hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattices exhibit an energy gap at the
charge neutrality point (CNP) even in the absence of a perpendicular electric
field. In BLG, the application of a perpendicular electric field tunes the
energy gap at the CNP, which contrasts with single-layer graphene and is
similar to the family of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The hBN/BLG moir\'e
superlattice is associated with non-trivial energy-band topology and a narrow
energy band featuring a van Hove singularity. By employing a dual-gated device
structure where both the perpendicular displacement field and the carrier
density are individually controllable, systematic engineering of the
energy-band structure can be achieved. The data presented here demonstrate the
universality and diversity in the physics of hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattices.

TL;DR: This paper explores the realization of finite tunnel magnetoresistance in ordinary antiferromagnets. By leveraging the Mn_3Sn system with inverse 120° order and using MgO as a tunnel insulator, they achieve a TMR ratio exceeding 1000%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding magnetoresistance and spin-dependent tunneling effects is crucial for advancing magnetic sensors and electronic memory devices.

Method: They utilized Density Functional Theory with the analytical continuation method to calculate the TMR effect in Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn magnetic tunnel junctions, optimizing the structure for most efficient spin-orbit torque switching.

Result: A finite TMR ratio of about 1000% is observed in Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn junctions, attributed to the combination of Mn3Sn's spin splitting in momentum space and MgO's screening effect.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that antiferromagnetic materials with time-reversal symmetry broken order can exhibit large tunnel magnetoresistance without net spin polarization, offering a new route for realizing high-performance magnetic devices.

Abstract: The antiferromagnets with the time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic
structures possess a finite spin splitting in the momentum space, and may
contribute to a realization of a finite tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect
even with magnets with zero net spin polarization. In this paper, we study the
TMR effect with the noncollinear antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ whose
inverse $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic order breaks the time-reversal
symmetry. In particular, we employ the representative barrier material
$\mathrm{MgO}$ as the tunnel insulator, and calculate the TMR effect in the
$\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}(01\bar{1}0)/\mathrm{MgO}(110)/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs), which has an optimal geometry for the spin-orbit
torque switching of the magnetic configurations. We show that a finite TMR
ratio reaching $\gtrsim 1000\%$ appears in the
$\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ MTJs, which is due to the
spin splitting properties of $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ in the momentum space combined
with the screening effect of $\mathrm{MgO}$.

Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), a hallmark of topological insulators,
enables dissipationless, spin-polarized edge transport and has been predicted
in various two-dimensional materials. However, challenges such as limited
scalability, low-temperature operation, and the lack of robust electronic
transport have hindered practical implementations. Here, we demonstrate the
QSHE in an InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum well structure operating at
elevated temperatures. This platform meets key criteria for device integration,
including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When
the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized
resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal
measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE. Helical edge transport remains
stable up to T = 60 K, with further potential for higher-temperature operation.
Our findings establish the InAs/GaInSb system as a promising candidate for
integration into next-generation devices harnessing topological
functionalities, advancing the development of topological electronics.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a theoretical model of a metallic magnetic system
with an antitoroidal order. We introduce a mechanism of indirect interaction of
conducting fermions with localized spins based on the tunneling processes of
conducting fermions through the localized spins. We demonstrate that
interaction of conducting fermions with an antitoroidal order results in odd in
momentum spin-momentum locking. The interaction resembles Rashba spin-orbit
coupling but breaks the time-reversal symmetry. As a result, we show that a
ferromagnet with the antitoroidal order is an insulator with anomalous Hall
effect occurring without any spin-orbit coupling.

Abstract: We investigate higher-order topological insulators protected by chiral and
mirror symmetries. Using models in the BDI class, which include the
prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, we show that breaking mirror
symmetries that anticommute with the chiral operator leads to edge-selective
bulk-boundary correspondence, with gap closings and bound states appearing only
along a subset of boundaries of the same orientation. We define a new
edge-sensitive topological invariant, distinguishing this mechanism from
previous reports of non-topological edge-selection effects.

TL;DR: Phase-change memory (PCM) in memory computing shows potential for deep learning and cryogenic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the physics of memory devices like PCM is crucial for advancing in-memory computing and its applications.

Method: Characterized PCM devices across a wide temperature range, studying phase transitions, threshold switching, electrical transport, structural relaxation, and read noise.

Result: Detailed understanding of PCM behavior in low temperatures and its implications for computational tasks and precision.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights for optimizing PCM-based in-memory computing for deep learning and cryogenic applications.

Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) is an emerging non-von Neumann paradigm that
leverages the intrinsic physics of memory devices to perform computations
directly within the memory array. Among the various candidates, phase-change
memory (PCM) has emerged as a leading non-volatile technology, showing
significant promise for IMC, particularly in deep learning acceleration.
PCM-based IMC is also poised to play a pivotal role in cryogenic applications,
including quantum computing and deep space electronics. In this work, we
present a comprehensive characterization of PCM devices across temperatures
down to 5 K, covering the range most relevant to these domains. We
systematically investigate key physical mechanisms such as phase transitions
and threshold switching that govern device programming at low temperatures. In
addition, we study attributes including electrical transport, structural
relaxation, and read noise, which critically affect readout behavior and, in
turn, the precision achievable in computational tasks.

Abstract: During the melting transition of dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG), the
order of the lipid chains and the three-dimensional, vesicular structural
arrangement change simultaneously. These changes result in peculiar heat
capacity profiles extended over a broad temperature range with seven
$c_p$-maxima. Here, we present calorimetric, viscosity, and volume expansion
coefficient data at various ionic strengths and charges. We propose a simple
theory that explains the calorimetric data in terms of the coexistence of two
membrane geometries, both of which can melt. During the transition, the
equilibrium between these two geometries changes cooperatively. This
equilibrium depends on the interactions between the membranes and the solvent,
on the membrane's charge and the ionic strength of the buffer. Solvent
interactions also contribute to the volume change of the membrane phases.
Unlike uncharged membranes, we find that enthalpy changes are no longer
proportional to volume changes. Therefore, the pressure dependence of the
calorimetric profiles differs from that of uncharged membranes. Our theory
explains the pressure dependence of calorimetric profiles qualitatively and
quantitatively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the same theory can be used to
describe pretransition and ripple formation in phosphatidylcholines. A key
takeaway from this article is that solvent molecules (e.g., H2O) are part of
the membrane and, in the case of DMPG, water cannot be considered a separate
phase.

### [131] [Algebraic quantisation approach to integrable differential-difference equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21775)
*Sylvain Carpentier,Alexander V. Mikhailov,Jing Ping Wang*

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for quantizing integrable non-Abelian differential-difference equations using algebraic quantization based on quantization ideals. It applies this method to the Toda hierarchy and identifies a bi-quantum structure, as well as a non-standard quantization without a commutative counterpart. The approach is illustrated with a variety of integrable lattices, and explicit quantization solutions are provided for each system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of algebraic methods for quantizing complex systems, particularly integrable ones, is motivated by the challenge of preserving structure during quantization. This approach using quantization ideals offers a systematic way to handle such systems.

Method: The method involves defining a quantization ideal within an algebraic framework to perform quantization on non-Abelian integrable systems. It applies this to the Toda hierarchy and other systems, identifying both bi-quantum and non-standard quantizations.

Result: The paper successfully applies the method to a wide range of integrable lattices, demonstrating that quantization ideals can be used to create quantum systems in Heisenberg form for each, yielding explicit solutions.

Conclusion: This work establishes a robust method for quantizing non-Abelian integrable systems and highlights its versatility across different lattice systems.

Abstract: We develop an algebraic quantisation approach, based on quantisation ideals,
and apply it to integrable non-Abelian differential--difference equations. We
show that the Toda hierarchy admits a bi-quantum structure whose classical
(commutative) limit recovers a well-known Poisson pencil. In addition, we
discover a non-standard quantisation that has no commutative counterpart. In
both cases we present the quantum systems in the Heisenberg form.
  The generality of the method is illustrated through a wide range of
integrable lattices, including the modified Volterra, Bogoyavlensky,
Ablowitz-Ladik, relativistic Toda, Merola-Ragnisco-Tu, Adler-Yamilov,
Chen-Lee-Liu, Belov-Chaltikian, and Blaszak-Marciniak systems. For each of
them, we construct explicit quantisation ideals and present the first few
commuting quantum Hamiltonians.
