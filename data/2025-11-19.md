TL;DR: Multiscale synergy steers complex behaviors in numerous scientific domains through structured design principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling multiscale interactions in complex systems to engineer novel phenomena and functionalities.

Method: Introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) with tunable relative hopping parameter α to achieve quantum metamorphosis.

Result: As α varies, the spectrum shifts continuously between quantum Hall states, exhibits mini-gaps, and hosts edge-bulk hybrid states, multi-scale topology, flat bands, and isolated edge bands.

Conclusion: This framework paves the way for scalable and programmable engineering of multiscale emergent phenomena, with potential applications in quantum computing, sensing, and photonics.

Abstract: Multiscale synergy -- the interplay of a system's distinct characteristic length, time, and energy scales -- is becoming a unifying thread across many contemporary branches of science. Ranging from moiré and super-moiré materials and cold atoms to DNA-templated superlattices and nested photonic networks, multiscale synergy produces behaviors not obtainable at any single scale alone. Yet a general framework that programs cross-scale interplay to steer spectra, transport, and topology has been missing. Here, we elevate multiscale synergy from a byproduct to a general design principle for emergent phenomena. Specifically, we introduce a scale-programmable framework for hierarchically nested lattices (HNLs) that can host quantum metamorphosis (QuMorph) -- a continuous evolution between system-dependent features governed by a dimensionless tunable parameter $α$ (the relative hopping). To exemplify, we show an HNL, in which as $α$ changes, the spectrum metamorphoses from integer quantum Hall-like to anomalous quantum Hall-like, passing through a cocoon regime with proliferating mini-gaps. This multiscale mixing yields multiple novel phenomena, including hybrid edge-bulk states, scale-dependent topology, topologically embedded flat bands, and isolated edge bands. We propose a feasible photonic implementation using commercially available coupled-resonator arrays, outline spatial-spectral signatures to map QuMorph, and explore applications for multi-timescale nonlinear optics. Our work establishes a scalable and programmable paradigm for engineering multiscale emergent phenomena.

### [2] [Charge reservoir as a design concept for plasmonic antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13932)
*Rostislav Řepa,Michal Horák,Tomáš Šikola,Vlastimil Křápek*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Plasmonic antennas with large cross-sections suffer from radiative losses, limiting their field enhancement despite large charge reservoirs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating the role of charge reservoir size in plasmonic antennas and understanding its impact on field enhancement is crucial for optimizing their performance in optical devices and sensing applications.

Method: The study involved testing the hypothesis that extensive charge storage in megascale antennas leads to significant field amplification. It utilized nanofocusing effects observed in propagating plasmons as inspiration. Through computational modeling and practical experiments, the impact of cross-sectional area on radiative loss was analyzed.

Result: The research identified that as the antenna's cross-section increases, the charge storage capacity does rise, but this is offset by enhanced radiative losses. Consequently, field enhancement remains limited even with larger charge reservoirs.

Conclusion: The key takeaway is that while larger cross-sections boost charge storage in plasmonic antennas, they result in more radiative losses, which are the main factor constraining field enhancement. This insight is vital for advancing applications in optical devices and sensing technologies relying on plasmonic field amplification.

Abstract: Plasmonic antennas exploit localized surface plasmons to shape, confine, and enhance electromagnetic fields with subwavelength resolution. The field enhancement is contributed to by various effects, such as the inherent surface localization of plasmons or the plasmonic lightning-rod effect. Inspired by nanofocusing observed for propagating plasmons, we test the hypothesis that plasmonic antennas with a large cross-section represent a large charge reservoir, enabling large induced charge and field enhancement. Our study reveals that a large charge reservoir is accompanied by large radiative losses, which are the dominant factor, resulting in a low field enhancement.

Conclusion: 建立了一个预测有限尺寸系统 bandgap 关闭的框架，帮助设计更高阶的拓扑绝缘体，并可能用于稳健的光导和量子计算 device

Abstract: Higher-order topology is prized for its ability to realize lower-dimensional boundary states which are stable beyond fine-tuning. However, disorder presents a failure mechanism that can destroy topological in-gap states. Here, we investigate a disordered two-dimensional polariton lattice and employ the spectral localizer framework to define a real-space topological index rooted in crystalline spatial symmetries. This framework enables direct real-space mapping of topology beyond conventional momentum-space classifications, confirming the presence of corner and edge modes in this generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Furthermore, it can directly quantify topological protection of a state. We leverage the versatility of our platform to experimentally realize normally distributed, random disorder and find that the corner states persist until the spectral gap closes. Experimentally, this corresponds to a disorder strength of approximately one quarter of the spectral gap. The spectral localizer accurately identifies the disorder strength at which the bandgap closes, establishing the framework as a predictive tool for every finite size system. Our results broaden the design principles for higher-order topological insulators and open the way towards imple menting disorder-resilient devices for robust lasing, light-routing, and quantum computation.

Abstract: Graphite is a cornerstone material for revolutionary technologies, from energy storage to the entire field of two-dimensional materials. Despite its foundational role, the predictive power required for engineering emergent optical behavior in van der Waals heterostructures is severely constrained by persistent discrepancies in reported optical constants. We resolve this long-standing ambiguity by deploying a multi-modal approach that synergizes far-field spectroscopic ellipsometry with nanoscale near-field optical probing (s-SNOM) and micro-reflectance spectroscopy. We have established a new, self-consistent set of optical constants (n and k) for both in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic directions across the ultraviolet-to-near-infrared spectrum. This work presents a unified set of optical constants that addresses inconsistencies in the existing literature. By establishing this definitive reference, we provide the essential foundation for the quantitative modeling and engineering of light-matter interactions in the evolving landscape of carbon-based nanophotonics.

Abstract: Understanding and exploiting the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems is nowadays at the core of a broad range of scientific and technological endeavors. Within the optical domain, light evolution in a nonlinear multimode environment presents a formidable problem, as its chaotic evolution often hinders predictive insights. Recently, an optical thermodynamic framework has been put forward that, in a systematic manner, can not only predict but also harness the intricate behavior of these systems. In this work, by deploying entropic principles, we demonstrate a counterintuitive optical process in which light, launched into any input port of a judiciously designed nonlinear array, universally channels into a tightly localized ground state, a response that is completely unattainable in linear conservative arrangements. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between lattice structure and the way the kinetic and nonlinear Hamiltonian components unfold, leading to two optical thermal processes: a Joule-Thomson-like expansion followed by mode thermalization. Experimentally, this effect is demonstrated in properly configured nonlinear time-synthetic mesh lattices, where the optical temperature approaches near zero, causing light to condense at a single spot, regardless of the initial excitation position. The effect demonstrated here opens new avenues for applying the principles of optical thermodynamics in realizing novel optical functionalities, such as all-optical beam steering, multiplexing, and nonlinear beam shaping in high-power regimes, while also offering a greater understanding of the remarkable physics of light-matter interactions in multimode nonlinear systems.

Abstract: Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) continue to be intriguing due to their applications in super resolution imaging and spontaneous emission control. One of the successful realizations of HMMs is a layered metal-dielectric film. Despite the extensive knowledge in thin film technology and the promises of HMM's applications, the scale up and practical utilization of HMMs have not yet occurred. This is due to the difficulty in identifying versatile design parameters for HMM fabrication and characterization via accessible techniques. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry and numerical simulations are utilized to identify design parameters for fabrication of HMMs using the silver and alumina system as a model system. Four interdependent design parameters are explored: thicknesses of metal and dielectric layers, transition wavelength, and minimum number of periods required for a layered metal-dielectric film to display hyperbolic dispersion. The findings are presented as a practical engineering design chart.

TL;DR: Temporal metamaterial-based antireflection coatings can avoid spatial insertions, but current models with finite temporal sections cause periodic reflections. This work introduces a `temporal taper` with an experimentally validated 1D voltage-controlled varactor-based metamaterial that provides broadband antireflection, enabling agile impedance matching without spatial insertions, positioning it as a promising solution for future photonic systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving efficient and flexible wave control with minimal interference is a key challenge in metamaterials.

Method: Experimentally designed a 1D voltage-controlled varactor-based temporal metamaterial and demonstrated its performance with a broadband antireflection effect.

Result: The `temporal taper` shows promise with improved impedance matching across various terminal loads.

Conclusion: This advancement in temporal metamaterials could lead to innovative optical systems with fewer constraints and higher efficiency.

Abstract: As time can be introduced as an additional degree of freedom, temporal metamaterials nowadays open up new avenues for wave control and manipulation. Among these advancements, temporal metamaterial-based antireflection coatings have recently emerged as an innovative method that inherently avoids additional spatial insertions. However, prior temporal antireflection models with finite inserted temporal transition sections that rely on the destructive interference mechanism exhibit residual periodic strong reflections at high frequencies, fundamentally limiting the achievable bandwidth. In this work, the concept of "temporal taper", the temporal counterpart of a conventional spatial taper with a nearly full-band antireflection feature and good compatibility with gradual time-varying components, has been experimentally realized. A 1D temporal metamaterial base on voltage-controlled varactors has been designed experimentally validated. The temporal taper based broadband antireflection exempts the system from spatial matching insertions, and enables agile impedance matching for various terminal loads, positioning it as a promising approach in future photonic systems.

TL;DR: Colloidal nanocrystals are promising for lasing but require high concentrations. We integrated CdSe/CdS 2D nanoplatelets into liquid-core fibers, achieving efficient gain even at low concentrations and low loss. The fiber's low-loss optical waveguiding is crucial for stimulated emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lasing applications for colloidal nanocrystals are promising but require overcoming concentration challenges. Exploring alternative platforms like liquid-core fibers could enable scalable and efficient lasing systems.

Method: We integrated colloidally dispersed CdSe/CdS 2D nanoplatelets into liquid-core optical fibers to create a scalable platform. We measured the gain and threshold performance under various concentrations and pumping conditions.

Result: The study achieved a gainefficient laser operation at a concentration two orders lower than conventional nanocrystals, with a low loss platform providing high efficiency. This demonstrates the potential of liquid-core fibers for scalable colloidal nanocrystal lasers.

Conclusion: Colloidal nanocrystals are viable for lasing when integrated into suitable optical platforms like liquid-core fibers. This approach reduces required concentrations and could lead to scalable, high-efficiency lasers with low losses.

Abstract: Colloidal nanocrystals are unique optical gain materials due to their high intrinsic absorption, excellent quantum yield, and tunable emission. However, integration of colloidal nanocrystal solutions into photonic systems for lasing applications is challenging since high concentration levels are required for optical amplification. Here, we address this challenge by integrating colloidally dispersed core/crown CdSe/CdS 2D nanoplatelets in liquid-core optical fibers as a scalable platform. The platform allowed achieving sufficiently effective gain for amplified spontaneous emission at a threshold as low as 1.8 kW/cm2 under quasi-CW pumping, even at a con-centration two orders of magnitude lower than the minimal concentration considered to be required for gain in conventional colloidal quantum dots. We show that the low-loss optical waveguiding of the fiber is crucial for efficient stimulated emission, rendering liquid-core fibers as a promising and unique platform to realize lasers based on colloidally dispersed nanocrystals.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of conflicting material properties for UV applications, providing a solution for high-density integrated circuits.

Method: The study combines experiments, characterization, first-principles calculations, and near-field imaging to validate CdPS3's properties.

Result: CdPS3 exhibits an anomalously high refractive index and wide bandgap, surpassing traditional materials in UV_visible photonics.

Conclusion: The findings open new possibilities for advanced photonic devices, marking a significant advancement in nanophotonics.

Abstract: The development of nanophotonics is hindered by a fundamental trade-off between a material's refractive index (n) and its electronic bandgap (Eg), which severely restricts the choice of materials for short-wavelength applications. This challenge is particularly acute in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) spectra, where high-performance devices require materials that are simultaneously highly refractive and transparent. Here, we report on the van der Waals (vdW) crystal cadmium phosphorus trisulfide (CdPS3) as a solution to this long-standing problem. Through comprehensive optical and structural characterization, we show that CdPS3 possesses an anomalously high in-plane refractive index across the visible spectrum approaching 3 in the near-UV, combined with a wide indirect bandgap. This combination of properties, which circumvents the empirical Moss's law, is validated by first-principles calculations and direct near-field imaging of highly confined waveguide modes. These findings establish CdPS3 as a leading material for UV-visible photonics, opening a new pathway for the development of high-density integrated circuits and metasurfaces.

Conclusion: 该研究为范德华材料的折射率测量提供了一种简便、高效的方法，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We present a reflectivity-based method for measuring the in-plane refractive index of transparent van der Waals (vdW) materials. The approach enables the characterization of as small as $3 \times 3$~{\textmu}m$^2$ exfoliated flakes on a non-transmissive substrate without assuming any specific spectral shape of the refractive index. Exfoliated flakes are most commonly obtained through mechanical exfoliation, which generally produces vdW flakes with tens-of-micron lateral dimensions. As a result, conventional ellipsometry - which depends on large, uniform areas and specific spectral models - becomes challenging to apply. Our method determines the refractive index directly from the spectral position of reflectivity minima, provided the flake thickness and the substrate complex refractive index are known. We demonstrate the technique on hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$), a vdW semiconductor with high refractive index and low absorption, retrieving its in-plane refractive index across the visible range. The results both validate previous ellipsometry measurements and establish this method as an accessible and spectral-model-free alternative for refractive index characterization of vdW materials.

Abstract: We introduce higher order polariton topological insulator (HOTI) realized with fractal array of microcavity pillars arranged into Sierpinski gasket-like geometry. This system exhibiting self similarity in different generations, can support localized modes either in the external or multiple internal corners depending on the controllable distortion introduced into first generation structure. Nonlinear corner modes can be selectively excited in this dissipative system using resonant optical pumping. Strong polariton-polariton interactions lead to tilt of the resonance curves and bistability as the pump amplitude increases, allowing control over corner state profiles. Linear stability analysis illustrates dynamical stability of such states. Our results show how nontrivial topology manifests itself in self similar, aperiodic structures and indicate that fractal geometry may bring qualitatively new localization scenarios in polariton HOTIs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model, also known as the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, is arguably the most universal model in classical and quantum physics, describing spectrally narrow or long-wavelength distributions of interacting waves or particles. Modern applications -- from oceanic and atmospheric flows to photonics and cold atoms -- predominantly involve states that are far from equilibrium, culminating in the regime of fully developed turbulence. To date, a consistent theoretical description of such states has only existed for weakly interacting quasiparticles. Here we present a theory of strong turbulence in the two-dimensional $N$-component Gross-Pitaevskii model for both repulsive and attractive interactions, corresponding to the defocusing and focusing cases, respectively. In the focusing case, we show that attraction is enhanced by multi-wave effects, leading to a critical-balance state independent of the pumping level. In the defocusing case, repulsion is suppressed by collective effects, giving rise to another type of universality in strong turbulence -- independence from the bare coupling constant. The theory is confirmed by analytical results in the many-component limit and by direct numerical simulations of the single-component GP model.

Abstract: We study the entanglement asymmetry for the space-inversion symmetry of free fermions on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice with an on-site energy imbalance between the two sublattices. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of a local subsystem exhibits nonanalytic dependence on the energy imbalance, due to the presence of Dirac points in the Brillouin zone. We also study the quench dynamics from the ground state into the inversion-symmetric point at which the energy imbalance vanishes. Under certain conditions on the subsystem geometry, the entanglement asymmetry relaxes to a finite value after the quench, revealing that the inversion-symmetry breaking in the initial ground state can persist even under the symmetric dynamics. We attribute the absence of symmetry restoration to the presence of a flat energy dispersion (flat band) in a specific direction.

Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We feature out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and tripling phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. As for the in-vacuum case, the three-body clustering is always the lowest-lying phase. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper tripling phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.

Abstract: We investigate the stability of current-carrying states with quasi-momentum $K$ in the Bose-condensed phase of the hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on a square lattice, where particles transfer between two sites separated by distance $r$ with hopping amplitude decaying algebraically with $r$ as $\propto r^{-α}$. Using a mean-field theory, we analyze the excitation spectrum and determine the critical quasi-momenta associated with Landau and dynamical instabilities. We find that the long-range hopping suppresses the critical quasi-momenta and makes them vanish at $α=3$. Near $α=3$, we show that the critical quasi-momentum $K_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the dynamical instability exhibits the scaling behavior $K_\mathrm{c} \propto Δ^{1+Δ}$ with $Δ=α-3$, where the scaling exponent explicitly depends on $Δ$, as a consequence of the long-range nature of the hopping.

Abstract: Critical exponents characterize the divergent scaling of thermodynamic quantities near phase transitions and allow for the classification of physical systems into universality classes. While quantum gases thermalizing by interparticle interactions fall into the XY model universality class, the ideal Bose gas has been predicted to form a distinct universality class whose signatures have not yet been revealed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of critical scaling in a two-dimensional quantum gas of essentially noninteracting photons, which thermalize by radiative contact to a reservoir of molecules inside a microcavity. By measuring the spatial correlations near the condensation transition, we determine the critical exponent for the correlation length to be $ν= 0.52(3)$. Our results constitute a first experimental test of the long-standing scaling predictions for the Bose gas universality class.

Abstract: We demonstrate a method for generating entanglement between trapped atomic ions based on adiabatically ramped state-dependent forces. By ramping both the amplitude of the state-dependent force and the motional mode frequencies, we realize an entangling operation that is robust to motional mode occupation and drifts in the mode frequencies. We measure Bell state fidelities above 0.99 across a broad range of ramp parameters and with motional occupations up to 10 phonons. This technique enables high-fidelity entangling operations without ground-state cooling, has a reduced calibration overhead, and is well suited for both quantum logic spectroscopy applications and scalable quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: We introduce a perturbative formulation for a nonlinear extension of the J-matrix method of scattering in two dimensions. That is, we obtain the scattering matrix for the time-independent nonlinear Schrödinger equation in two dimensions with circular symmetry. The formulation relies on the linearization of products of orthogonal polynomials and on the utilization of the tools of the J-matrix method. Gauss quadrature integral approximation is instrumental in the numerical implementation of the approach. We present the theory for a general ψ^{2n + 1} nonlinearity, where n is a natural number, and obtain results for the cubic and quintic nonlinearities, ψ^3 and ψ^5. At certain value(s) of the energy, we observe the occurrence of bifurcation with two stable solutions. This curious and interesting phenomenon is a clear signature and manifestation of the underlying nonlinearity.

Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.

*Ali Abu-Nada,Aryan Iliat,Russell Ceballo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Amplitude damping limits qubit lifetimes by energy loss, and the paper proposes a two-component hybrid upgrade: an ancilla qubit and a predictive circuit. This improves T1 by suppressed decay via cooperativity factors. Hardware modifications are modular and compatible with existing systems. The methods are supported by Lindblad equations and numerical simulations surpassing the W-M limit in simulations with IBM-scale parameters (T1=50μs).Ancilla enhances the system's lifetime, while the predictive circuit boosts efficiency and accuracy. Detailed derivations are provided for educational purposes.visão de motivação: Building on quantum error correction and feedback control in qubit systems, this work addresses a practical challenge in quantum computing. The solution is both analytical and practical, offering a potential hardware upgrade for current quantum technologies. This could be particularly valuable in early-stage quantum computing applications where coherence times are still relatively short. A methodological contribution is the detailed derivation of effective decay rates, which could facilitate further research in feedback control of quantum systems. O metodologia: The paper starts by highlighting the problem, reviews existing solutions, and introduces their limitations before presenting the novel approach. It delves into the physics with equations and model derivations, selects relevant parameters, presents results from simulations, compares results to benchmarks, discusses implications of the findings, and provides instructions for replication. Each step is thorough, though it could be more concise. The approach is promising and feasible, backed by numerical evidence.Overall, this is a solid contribution that could stimulate practical developments in qubit control and quantum error correction, demonstrating the practical importance of feedback control in quantum computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constructing reliable quantum computers requires high coherence times for qubits. Amplitude damping, a form of quantum noise, causes qubits to lose their quantum states rapidly, which is a significant barrier to building quantum computers. The Wiseman-Milburn (W-M) feedback scheme is a standard method to stabilize qubits by continuously measuring and correcting for noise, but it has limitations. For example, it only addresses one quadrature of the qubit at a time, and the corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. This paper proposes an improved feedback scheme to get around some of these limitations, potentially allowing quantum systems to maintain their coherence for longer periods. This could be particularly valuable given the challenges of maintaining stable qubits in current quantum computing technologies and the potential for longer coherence times to enable more complex quantum computations.

Method: The proposed upgrade consists of two components: first, a coherently coupled ancilla qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back quantum-coherently on the system, recovering information from both field quadratures. Second, a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current and phase-aligns the correction to overcome hardware latency. The paper uses Lindblad equations to model the system and derives effective decay rates analytically, showing how the ancilla suppresses emission via cooperativity and how the predictor suppresses residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Numerical simulations with IBM-scale parameters (baseline T1 = 50 μs) demonstrate that the upgrade achieves three to four times longer T1, along with improved population retention and energy efficiency.

Result: The upgrade shows significant improvements, achieving three to four times longer T1 with improved population retention and energy efficiency. The amplification of T1 surpasses the theoretical limit of the standard W-M feedback, demonstrating the effectiveness of the hybrid upgrade. The method is modular, so it can be integrated into existing systems, and numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the design approach.  Additionally, the paper provides a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective decay rates, making the impact of each design element clear.

Conclusion: This work addresses an important challenge in quantum computing - stabilizing qubits against amplitude damping and extending coherence times. By proposing a hybrid feedback scheme combining a quantum ancilla and a predictive circuit, the paper offers a promising solution that overcomes limitations of conventional feedback methods. The numerical evidence from IBM-scale parameters shows remarkable improvements, suggesting the practicality of the approach for real-world quantum systems. Its modular design and detailed analysis make this a valuable contribution to the field of quantum error correction and feedback control, potentially enabling the development of more robust and scalable quantum technologies.

Abstract: Amplitude damping fundamentally limits qubit lifetimes by irreversibly leaking energy and information into the environment. Standard Wiseman--Milburn feedback offers only modest improvement because it acts on a single measured quadrature and its corrective drive is degraded by loop delay. We introduce a compact hybrid upgrade with two components: (i) a coherently coupled \emph{ancilla} qubit that receives the homodyne current and feeds back \emph{quantum-coherently} on the system, recovering information from \emph{both} field quadratures and intentionally engineered to decay much faster than the system; and (ii) a lightweight supervised predictor that forecasts the near-future homodyne current, phase-aligning the correction to overcome hardware latency. A Lindblad treatment yields closed-form effective decay rates: the ancilla suppresses the emission channel by a cooperativity factor, while the predictor further suppresses the residual decay in proportion to forecast quality. Using IBM-scale parameters (baseline \(T_1 = 50~μ\mathrm{s}\)), numerical simulations surpass the W--M limit, achieving \(\sim 3\!-\!4\times\) longer \(T_1\) together with improved population retention and integrated energy. The method is modular and hardware-compatible: ancilla coupling and supervised prediction can be added to existing W--M loops to convert leaked information into a precise, time-advanced corrective drive. We also include a detailed, student-friendly derivation of the effective rates for both ancilla-assisted and prediction-enhanced feedback, making the impact of each design element analytically transparent.

Abstract: We construct parametrized isometric tensor network states -- referred to as skeletons -- that allow us to explore phases of abelian topological order and can be efficiently implemented on quantum processors. We obtain stable finite correlation length deformations of string-net fixed points, which are constructed both by conserving virtual symmetries of the tensor and by imposing local isometry constraints. They connect distinct topological phases via a shared critical point, thereby providing analytically tractable examples of phase transitions beyond anyon condensation. By mapping such classes of 2D tensor networks to 1D stochastic automata with local update rules, we show that expectation values of generalized Pauli strings of arbitrary weight can be efficiently computed using classical methods. Therefore these skeletons not only serve as an organizing principle for abelian topological order but also provide a non-trivial testbed for quantum processors.

Abstract: Many living organisms can exploit quantum mechanical effects to gain distinct biological advantages. In plants, photosynthesis uses quantum coherence to achieve near 100% efficiency in energy transfer. With advances in experimental techniques, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy can reveal dynamic processes such as coherence and coupling within a system, and it plays an important role in studying energy transfer in photosynthesis. On the theory side, methods such as the generalized Bloch-Redfield theory and the hierarchical equations of motion are used to model photosynthetic systems. Quantum simulation, as a high-efficiency and low-complexity approach, has also made progress across various platforms in the study of photosynthesis. In recent years, a series of studies has introduced quantum coherence into artificial systems to enhance energy transfer efficiency, laying the groundwork for the design of coherent devices with efficient energy transport. Birds can use the weak geomagnetic field and spin-dependent chemical reactions to detect direction. Theoretical frameworks for animal navigation include magnetite-based mechanisms, magnetoreceptor genes, and the radical-pair mechanism. Quantum simulations of navigation have also advanced on multiple platforms. Inspired by animal navigation, diverse quantum effects have been applied to improve sensing and to support navigation tasks. This paper presents a comprehensive review of progress on quantum coherence in photosynthesis and avian navigation, along with related theoretical methods, quantum simulation approaches, and research on quantum coherent devices.

Abstract: We present a method to detect entanglement partitions of multipartite quantum systems, by exploiting their inherent symmetries. Structures like genuinely multipartite entanglement, $m$-separability and entanglement depth are detected as very special cases. This formulation enables us to characterize all the entanglement partitions of all three- and four- partite states and witnesses with unitary and permutation symmetry. In particular, we find and parametrize a complete set of bound entangled states therein. For larger systems, we provide a large family of analytical witnesses detecting many-body states of arbitrary size where none of the parties is separable from the rest. This method relies on weak Schur sampling with projective measurements, and thus can be implemented in a quantum computer. Beyond physics, our results extend to the mathematical literature: we establish new inequalities between matrix immanants, and characterize the set of such inequalities for matrices of size three and four.

Motivation: Accurate and efficient simulation of quantum systems is crucial for quantum computing.

Method: Proposes CETE algorithm which reformulates time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem. Starts from a mean-field Slater determinant and captures correlations exactly by solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in a contracted form.

Result: Reduces circuit depth by eliminating repeated correlations, enabling longer simulations on near-term devices. Illustrated through simulation of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction.

Conclusion: CETE offers a promising approach for simulating strongly correlated systems on near-term quantum devices with efficiency gains.

Abstract: We introduce the correlation-efficient time-evolution (CETE) algorithm for simulating quantum many-body dynamics. CETE recasts each step of time evolution as a time-independent correlation problem: the ansatz begins from a mean-field single Slater determinant and is then correlated to capture the true time-evolved state. We derive this exact ansatz from a contraction of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation onto the space of two electrons. Unlike conventional evolution by sequential short-time propagators, which must both correlate and decorrelate the state as the degree of correlation fluctuates in time, CETE correlates only once. This substantially reduces circuit depth, extending accessible simulation times on near-term quantum devices. We demonstrate the approach by simulating the time evolution of the hydrogen molecule's electronic wavefunction, highlighting the potential for the CETE algorithm to simulate strongly correlated systems on near-term devices.

Abstract: Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ansätze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. TrimCI iteratively expands the variational space and trims away unimportant states, allowing a random initial core to self-refine into an accurate approximation of exact ground state. Across challenging benchmarks, TrimCI achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with strikingly efficiency gains of several orders of magnitude. For [4Fe-4S] cluster, it matches recent quantum computing results with $10^6$-fold fewer determinants and CPU-hours. For the nitrogenase P-cluster, it matches selected-CI accuracy using $10^5$-fold fewer determinants. For $8\times8$ Hubbard model, it recovers over $99\%$ of the ground-state energy using only $10^{-28}$ of the Hilbert space. In some regimes, TrimCI attains orders-of-magnitude higher accuracy than AFQMC method. These results demonstrate that high-accuracy many-body ground states can be discovered directly from random determinants, establishing TrimCI as a prior-knowledge-free, accurate and highly efficient framework for quantum many-body systems. The compact explicit wavefunctions it produces further enable direct and rapid evaluation of observables.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for approximating the ground state of two-dimensional quantum systems using an isometric tensor network ansatz, which maps naturally to quantum circuits. Inspired by the density matrix renormalization group, we optimize tensors sequentially by diagonalizing a series of effective Hamiltonians. These are constructed using a tomography-inspired method on a qubit subset whose size depends only on the bond dimension. Our approach leverages quantum computers to enable accurate solutions without relying on approximate contractions, circumventing the exponential complexity faced by classical techniques. We demonstrate our method on the two-dimensional (2D) transverse-field Ising model, achieving ground-state optimization on up to 25 qubits with modest quantum overhead -- significantly less than standard solutions based on variational quantum eigensolvers. Overall, our results offer a path towards scalable variational quantum algorithms in both noisy and fault-tolerant regimes.

Abstract: We present a single-quench protocol that generates unitary $k$-designs with minimal control. A system first evolves under a random Hamiltonian $H_1$; at a switch time $t_s \geq t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ (the Thouless time), it is quenched to an independently drawn $H_2$ from the same ensemble and then evolves under $H_2$. This single quench breaks residual spectral correlations that prevent strictly time-independent chaotic dynamics from forming higher-order designs. The resulting ensemble approaches a unitary $k$-design using only a single control operation -- far simpler than Brownian schemes with continuously randomized couplings or protocols that apply random quenches at short time intervals. Beyond offering a direct route to Haar-like randomness, the protocol yields an operational, measurement-friendly definition of $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$ and provides a quantitative diagnostic of chaoticity. It further enables symmetry-resolved and open-system extensions, circuit-level single-quench analogs, and immediate applications to randomized measurements, benchmarking, and tomography.

Abstract: Nonstabiliserness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, capturing how much a quantum state breaks the symmetries that would make it classically simulable. Can nonstabiliserness be generated from stabiliser states simply by coupling them to a heat bath? We explore the thermodynamic limits of nonstabiliserness under minimal assumptions and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for when such a process can create it from an initial stabiliser state. This provides an analytic characterisation of the nonstabiliser states that are reachable in this way, together with quantitative bounds on their degree of nonstabiliserness. Our framework also identifies optimal regimes, specifying Hamiltonians that maximise nonstabiliserness generation and the critical temperatures at which it emerges.

Conclusion: This work opens a promising direction for practical applications of quantum machine learning by leveraging classical efficiency in training and quantum resources for sampling.

Abstract: Quantum generative learning is a promising application of quantum computers, but faces several trainability challenges, including the difficulty in experimental gradient estimations. For certain structured quantum generative models, however, expectation values of local observables can be efficiently computed on a classical computer, enabling fully classical training without quantum gradient evaluations. Although training is classically efficient, sampling from these circuits is still believed to be classically hard, so inference must be carried out on a quantum device, potentially yielding a computational advantage. In this work, we introduce Fermionic Born Machines as an example of such classically trainable quantum generative models. The model employs parameterized magic states and fermionic linear optical (FLO) transformations with learnable parameters. The training exploits a decomposition of the magic states into Gaussian operators, which permits efficient estimation of expectation values. Furthermore, the specific structure of the ansatz induces a loss landscape that exhibits favorable characteristics for optimization. The FLO circuits can be implemented, via fermion-to-qubit mappings, on qubit architectures to sample from the learned distribution during inference. Numerical experiments on systems up to 160 qubits demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and training framework.

TL;DR: Quantum simulation can reduce the number of arbitrary rotations needed for controlled time evolution by half when using symmetric Trotterizations compared to standard approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing offers promising applications, and optimizing quantum simulation algorithms is crucial for reducing resource requirements.

Method: The study introduces a compilation scheme that applies to symmetric Trotterizations, thereby halving the number of arbitrary rotations needed.

Result: This approach significantly reduces the $T$-cost in fault-tolerant quantum simulation by decreasing the number of required magic states.

Conclusion: The research provides a method to optimize quantum simulation, making it more efficient and practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Quantum simulation is a promising application for quantum computing. Quantum simulation algorithms may require the ability to control the time evolution unitary. Naive techniques to control a unitary can substantially increase the required computational resources. A standard approach to controlling Trotterized time evolution doubles the number of single-qubit arbitrary rotations. Here, we describe a compilation scheme that does not increase the number of arbitrary rotations for symmetric Trotterizations, which applies to second-order and higher Suzuki-Trotter decompositions. This halves the number of arbitrary rotations required to implement controlled, Trotterized time evolution compared to the standard approach. Arbitrary rotations contribute significantly to resource estimates in a fault-tolerant architecture due to the number of required magic states. Therefore, arbitrary rotations dominate the $T$-cost of fault-tolerant implementations of quantum simulation. This construction reduces the number of arbitrary rotations for controlled Trotter evolution to that of uncontrolled Trotter evolution, thereby reducing the cost of fault-tolerant quantum simulation.

Abstract: This study examines the quantitative relationship between linguistic regularities and computational search complexity through a hybrid classical-quantum framework applied to Renaissance Italian texts. Using four representative works from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries-Il Principe (Machiavelli), Il Cortegiano (Castiglione), I Ricordi (Guicciardini), and Orlando Furioso (Ariosto)-we construct character-based n-gram models under both a historically grounded 25-letter orthography and the full modern Italian alphabet. These models provide corpus-derived probabilistic baselines for evaluating substitution-cipher search processes. Combining classical hill climbing and simulated annealing with Grover-style quantum-inspired estimates and a QUBO annealing formulation, we quantify how the probability that a key produces a linguistically plausible decryption (pgood) relates to expected computational effort. Across cipher lengths from 200 to 1000 characters, empirical results confirm the predicted dependence of Grover oracle calls on 1/sqrt(pgood) and show that longer texts yield sharper score distributions and smaller feasible key regions. Overall, the findings establish a link between linguistic redundancy and search-space contraction, providing an empirical framework for comparing classical, quantum-inspired, and idealized quantum search dynamics under unified corpus-driven constraints.

Abstract: We examine a quantum routing mechanism utilizing a giant-atom-like array coupled to two one-dimensional waveguides. The giant-atom-like array is formed by a one-dimensional array of three-level-systems. In the regime of strong atom-waveguide coupling and weak inter-atomic interactions, this system functions as an efficient and directionally controllable single-photon router. Our analysis shows that the routing behavior is influenced by effective phase accumulation and interference effects, which can be adjusted by varying the number of coupling sites $N$, the photon energy $E$, and the inter-atomic coupling strength $J$. Importantly, we identify configurations that enable perfect photon transfer ($100 \%$ efficiency) over a wide range of energies and that provide dynamic control over the output channel. In addition, we investigate how the system responds to changes in its internal parameters, demonstrating the robustness and scalability of routing performance. These findings underscore the potential of this setup for implementation in reconfigurable and integrated quantum photonic networks.

Abstract: Postselection is a non-deterministic mechanism to entangle subsystems, often used in weakly-excited systems. We here show how highly-excited ensembles of two-level emitters can be entangled by photon detection. A collective spin is formed, characterized by a squeezing parameter detected by far-field measurements. While decoherence is detrimental to this conditional entanglement, successive photon detections act as a purification process and restores the spin squeezing. Our work opens up new avenues for the generation of postselected entanglement in open quantum systems.

Abstract: The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.

Abstract: We formulate a canonical quantization of Equilibrium Thermodynamics by applying Dirac's theory of constrained systems. Thermodynamic variables are treated as conjugate pairs of coordinates and momenta, allowing extensive and intensive quantities to be promoted to operators in a Hilbert space. The formalism is applied to the ideal gas, the van der Waals gas, and the photon gas, illustrating both first- and second-class quantization procedures. For the ideal gas, a Schrödinger-like equation emerges in which entropy plays the role of time, and the wave function acquires a phase determined by the internal energy. A pseudo-Hermitian framework restores Hermiticity of the temperature operator and establishes the equivalence among constraint realizations. The approach naturally leads to thermodynamic uncertainty relations and suggests extensions to quantum and topological phase transitions, as well as black-hole and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

Abstract: Entropic uncertainty relations quantify the limits on the predictability of quantum measurements. When the measured system is correlated with a quantum memory, these limits are described by the memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation (MA-EUR). We examine the behavior of MA-EUR when the memory qubit undergoes noisy dynamics implemented via high-order controlled processes, namely, the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip. We consider a setting in which the control qubit is the very system on which the measurements are performed, while the target qubit serves as a noisy quantum memory. Focusing on Pauli channels, we show that feeding them into the quantum switch and the quantum time-flip can significantly reduce the total entropic uncertainty as compared to their direct application. Our results reveal that indefinite causal order and input-output direction can serve as resources to mitigate the effects of noise in the context of MA-EUR and its applications.

Abstract: We look into the task of differentiating between any two quantum channels and reconstructing them from the obtained measurement statistics with possibly limited information about the experimental set-up. We employ the communication matrix formalism where the measurement statistics of a prepare-and-measure scenario is represented as a stochastic communication matrix. In order to differentiate between any two quantum channels, the informational completeness of the set-up is both necessary and sufficient. On the other hand, if we want to uniquely characterize any quantum channel, in addition we also need to have a complete description of the set-up. We show that in many important cases we can deduce this information directly from the communication matrix of the set-up before applying the channel. Given that we trust the dimension of the system, we show that we can deduce the information completeness of the set-up directly from the rank of the communication matrix. Furthermore, we show that another quantity of the communication matrix, called the information storability, can be used to self-test the set-up (up to unitary or antiunitary freedom) for an important class of states and measurements. This provides us a semi-device-independent way to identify quantum channels from the prepare-and-measure statistics. Lastly, we consider scenarios where we might have some additional information about the channels or additional resources at our disposal which could help us relax some of the assumptions of the proposed scenario.

Abstract: Strongly correlated multi-photon states are indispensable resources for advanced quantum technologies, yet their deterministic generation remains challenging due to the inherent weak nonlinearity in most optical systems. Here, we propose a scalable architecture for producing correlated few-photon entangled states via cascaded inelastic scattering in a nonlinear waveguide. When a single photon scatters off a far detuned excited two-level emitter, it coherently converts into a propagating doublon, a bound photon pair with anomalous dispersion. This doublon can subsequently scatter off a downstream excited emitter to further convert into a triplon, and so on, thereby establishing a photon-number amplification cascade $|\cdot \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \!\! |\!\!: \rangle \!\! \rightarrow \! \! |\!\!\therefore \rangle \!\! \to \!\! ...$ Central to this process is the concept of a pseudo-giant atom, which we introduce here to capture the non-local scattering potential emergent from the wave functions of bound states. By implementing this scheme using a real giant atom with multiple engineered coupling points, we achieve unidirectional and full controllable photon conversion without backscattering. The resulting output state forms a programmable superposition of spatially and temporally isolated photon-number components, automatically sorted by their distinct group velocities. This work opens a new paradigm in quantum state engineering, enabling on-demand generation of complex multi-photon resources for quantum simulation, metrology, and scalable quantum networks.

Abstract: As quantum computers continue to improve and support larger, more complex computations, smart control hardware and compilers are needed to efficiently leverage the capabilities of these systems.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the execution of quantum algorithms on distributed quantum systems. The proposed method involves the development of a hardware design that supports parallel instruction execution and a compiler that modifies the order of instructions to increase parallelism opportunities. The hardware design can be flexibly configured to facilitate parallel execution of instructions that have identical parameters. Furthermore, the compiler uses the underlying hardware constraints to intelligently reorder and decompose instructions to avoid dependencies.
  The compiler, hardware, and their combination are evaluated using a runtime calculator and a benchmark quantum algorithm set. The results demonstrate a significant speedup, achieving a maximum average speedup of 16.5x and a maximum single-benchmark speedup of 56.2x relative to a baseline, serial execution model. Furthermore, we show a speedup can be obtained across all benchmarks using any of the proposed hardware schemes, although the degree of speedup is largely dependent on the type of quantum algorithm. Taken together, the results of this paper represent a significant step towards realizing high-performance quantum computing systems.

Motivation: Diamond NV centers are promising for quantum computing due to high coherence times and scalability.

Method: The compiler is built using specific instructions optimized for diamond NV centers, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps.

Result: The new compiler reduces execution time and gate count, and integrates classical instructions for state tomography and measurement-based operations.

Conclusion: The compiler successfully improves circuit execution fidelity by leveraging diamond-specific optimizations.

Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms as well as in control hardware designs are continuously being made. These quantum algorithms, expressed as quantum circuits, need to be translated to a set of instructions from a defined quantum instruction-set architecture (ISA), which are executed by the control hardware. These translations can be done by a compiler, targeting different qubit technologies. Specifically for diamond NV centers, no compiler exists to perform this translation. Therefore, in this paper we present a compiler designed for quantum computers utilizing diamond NV center specific instructions, such as direct carbon control and partial swaps, to reduce execution times and gate count. Additionally, our compiler adds on top of general compilers by allowing classical instructions to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations. The output of the compiler is tested in a diamond NV center specific simulator. Comparing a general compiler output with the diamond NV center specific output of our compiler while applying decoherence and depolarization noise showed reduced noise effects due to diamond specific decomposition. The compiler was also tested to perform state tomography and measurement-based operations, which showed to be functional. Our results show that we have successfully created a compiler with integrated classical and quantum instructions support, which can improve circuit execution fidelity by utilizing diamond specific optimizations.

Abstract: We propose quantum-mechanical systems in which the number of spatial dimensions is promoted to a dynamical quantum variable. As a consequence, the effective dimension depends on the physical state of the system. Interestingly, systems of this form exhibit enhanced symmetries compared to their fixed-dimensional counterparts. As an explicit example, we analyze a harmonic oscillator for which the spatial dimension is represented by a quantum operator. By evaluating the corresponding partition function, we uncover a temperature-dependent effective dimension. Our framework opens a new avenue for constructing physical systems, from gravity to condensed matter, where the very notion of dimensionality becomes quantum.

Abstract: We study quantum algorithms for approximating Lasserre's hierarchy values for polynomial optimization. Let $f,g_1,\ldots,g_m$ be real polynomials in $n$ variables and $f^\star$ the infimum of $f$ over the semialgebraic set $S(g)=\{x: g_i(x)\ge 0\}$. Let $λ_k$ be the value of the order-$k$ Lasserre relaxation. Assume either (i) $f^\star=λ_k$ and the optimum is attained in the $\ell_1$-ball of radius $1/2$, or (ii) $S(g)$ lies in the simplex $\{x\ge 0: \sum_j x_j\le 1/2\}$, and the constraints define this simplex. After an appropriate coefficient rescaling, we give a quantum algorithm based on matrix multiplicative weights that approximates $λ_k$ to accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ with runtime, for fixed $k$, \[ O(n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+n^{k/2}\varepsilon^{-5}),\qquad O\!\left(s_g\!\left[n^k\varepsilon^{-4}+\!\left(n^{k}+\!\sum_{i=1}^m n^{k-d_i}\right)^{1/2}\!\varepsilon^{-5}\right]\right), \] where $s_g$ bounds the sparsity of the coefficient-matching matrices associated with the constraints. Classical matrix multiplicative-weights methods scale as $O(n^{3k}\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ even in the unconstrained case. As an example, we obtain an $O(n\varepsilon^{-4}+\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-5})$ quantum algorithm for portfolio optimization, improving over the classical $O(n^{ω+1}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ bound with $ω\approx2.373$.
  Our approach builds on and sharpens the analysis of Apeldoorn and Gilyén for the SDPs arising in polynomial optimization. We also show how to implement the required block encodings without QRAM. Under the stated assumptions, our method achieves a super-quadratic speedup in the problem dimension for computing Lasserre relaxations.

Abstract: Information scrambling, the process by which quantum information spreads and becomes effectively inaccessible, is central to modern quantum statistical physics and quantum chaos. These lecture notes provide an introduction to information scrambling from both static and dynamical perspectives. The spectral properties of reduced density matrices arising from Haar-random states are developed through the geometry of the unitary group and the universal results of random matrix theory. This geometric framework yields universal, model-independent predictions for entanglement and spectral statistics, capturing generic features of quantum chaos without reference to microscopic details. Dynamical diagnostics such as the spectral form factor and out-of-time-ordered correlators further reveal the onset of chaos in time-dependent evolution.
  The notes are aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students in physics, mathematics, and computer science who are interested in the connections between quantum chaos, information dynamics, and quantum computing. Concepts such as entanglement growth, Haar randomness, random-matrix statistics, and unitary t-designs are introduced through their realization in random quantum circuits and circuit complexity. The same mathematical framework also underpins modern quantum-device benchmarking, where approximate unitary designs and random circuits translate geometric ideas into quantitative tools for assessing fidelity, noise, and scrambling efficiency in real quantum processors.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization, where an optimization problem is subject to PDE constraints, arises in various applications such as design, control, and inference. Solving such problems is computationally demanding because it requires repeatedly solving a PDE and using its solution within an optimization process. In this paper, we first propose a fully coherent quantum algorithm for solving PDE-constrained optimization problems. The proposed method combines a quantum PDE solver that prepares the solution vector as a quantum state, and a quantum optimizer that assumes oracle access to a quantized objective function. The central idea is the explicit construction of the oracle in a form of block-encoding for the objective function, which coherently uses the output of a quantum PDE solver. This enables us to avoid classical access to the full solution that requires quantum state tomography canceling out the potential quantum speedups. We also derive the overall computational complexity of the proposed method with respect to parameters for optimization and PDE simulation, where quantum speedup is inherited from the underlying quantum PDE solver. We numerically demonstrate the validity of the proposed method by applications, including a parameter calibration problem in the Black-Scholes equation and a material parameter design problem in the wave equation. This work presents the concept of composing quantum subroutines so that the weakness of one (i.e., prohibitive readout overhead) is neutralized by the strength of another (i.e., coherent oracle access), toward a bottleneck-free quantum algorithm.

Abstract: The Dirac delta function potential is considered within the real Hilbert space approach for complex wave functions, as well as quaternionic wave functions. As has been previously determined, the real Hilbert space approach enables the possibility of self-interacting physical systems. The self-interaction precludes confining states, and also imposes non-stationary quantum states, both of them representing novel situations that cannot be observed in terms of quantum wave functions. These results remark the differences between quaternionic quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm H$QM) and complex quantum mechanics ($\mathbbm C$QM), and also establish a method of solving the wave equation that may be applied to a variety of different cases.

Abstract: We develop a hybrid qubit-qumode framework for simulating quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions. In this approach, fermionic matter fields are represented by qubits, while U(1) gauge fields are encoded in continuous-variable bosonic modes whose canonical quadratures capture the electric and vector-potential components of the theory. To reconcile the non-compact phase space of the qumodes with the compact U(1) gauge symmetry, we introduce and compare two complementary constraint-enforcement strategies: (i) a squeezing-based projection that confines qumode states to the unit circle through an effective modification of the inner product, and (ii) a method that dynamically enforces compactness via a penalty Hamiltonian term. We construct the corresponding hybrid Hamiltonian, derive its decomposition into experimentally accessible qubit-qumode gates, and analyze its spectrum in the analytically tractable single-plaquette limit. The hybrid formulation reproduces the correct gauge-invariant dynamics and provides a scalable route toward simulating Abelian lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter on near-term hybrid quantum architectures. Ground-state preparation and convergence are demonstrated using a continuous-variable extension of the Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) algorithm, establishing a general framework for hybrid discrete-continuous quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories.

Abstract: Electron matter waves coherently diffract when passing through a periodic structure of light formed by two interfering light waves. In this so-called Kapitza-Dirac effect, the electron momentum changes due to absorption and emission of photons via stimulated Compton scattering. Until now, the effect has only been observed with low energy electrons due to the small momentum of a visible photon compared to the momentum of high energy electron leading to diffraction angles of 10^(-4) rad or smaller. We report on the observation of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in a scanning electron microscope using high energy (20 keV and 30 keV) electrons with de-Broglie wavelengths of 9 pm and 7 pm, respectively. The photon sidebands in the electron transverse momentum spectrum are detected in the convergent beam diffraction geometry using spatial filtering. As the coupling strength between the electrons and the light field increases, the sideband populations exhibit coherent, reversible oscillations among diffraction orders. The effect can serve as a coherent electron beam-splitter or a phase-plate in various types of electron microscopes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for current quantum devices. It employs a classical optimizer to iteratively update the parameters of a variational quantum circuit in order to search for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The efficacy of VQEs largely depends on the optimizer employed. Recent studies suggest that Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (QNG) can achieve faster convergence than vanilla gradient descent (VG), but at the cost of additional quantum resources to estimate Fubini-Study metric tensor in each optimization step. The Fubini-Study metric tensor used in QNG is related to the entire quantum state space and does not incorporate information about the target Hamiltonian. To take advantage of the structure of the Hamiltonian and address the limitation of additional computational cost in QNG, we propose Hamiltonian-aware Quantum Natural Gradient Descent (H-QNG). In H-QNG, we propose to use the Riemannian pullback metric induced from the lower-dimensional subspace spanned by the Hamiltonian terms onto the parameter space. We show that H-QNG inherits the desirable features of both approaches: the low quantum computational cost of VG and the reparameterization-invariance of QNG. We also validate its performance through numerical experiments on molecular Hamiltonians, showing that H-QNG achieves faster convergence to chemical accuracy while requiring fewer quantum computational resources.

TL;DR: Introducing chirality in quantum walks through random phases improves their effectiveness for protein interaction network prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy and reliability of network analysis algorithms has significant implications for biological research, particularly in understanding protein interactions which are critical for disease mechanisms.

Method: The authors enhanced the non-chiral quantum walk model by incorporating chirality via random-phase generators. They created a ' swarm' of quantum walks to leverage increased diversity in exploring the network structure. The method involved adjusting the Hamiltonian generators with phase parameters and employing a swarm-based approach to optimize performance.

Result: The chiral quantum walk method demonstrated enhanced robustness compared to the non-chiral version, significantly reducing the dependency on optimal evolution times. This improvement was attributed to the complementary dynamics within the swarm. By carefully choosing phase-sampling strategies, a balance was achieved between high predictive accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The integration of chirality through random phases in quantum walk algorithms offers a promising enhancement in network medicine, specifically for reconstructing protein-protein interaction networks. This approach not only maintains high accuracy under optimal conditions but also exhibits greater resilience, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where hyperparameter optimization is challenging.

Abstract: Reconstructing protein-protein interaction networks is a central challenge in network medicine, often addressed using link prediction algorithms. Recent studies suggest that quantum walk-based approaches hold promise for this task. In this paper, we build on these algorithms by introducing chirality through the addition of random phases in the Hamiltonian generators. The resulting additional degrees of freedom enable a more diverse exploration of the network, which we exploit by employing a swarm of chiral quantum walks. Thus, we enhance the predictive power of quantum walks on complex networks. Indeed, compared to a non-chiral algorithm, the chiral version exhibits greater robustness, making its performance less dependent on the optimal evolution time--a critical hyperparameter of the non-chiral model. This improvement arises from complementary dynamics introduced by chirality within the swarm. By analyzing multiple phase-sampling strategies, we identify configurations that achieve a practical trade-off: retaining the high predictive accuracy of the non-chiral algorithm at its optimal time while gaining the robustness typical of chirality. Our findings highlight the versatility of chiral quantum walks and their potential to outperform both classical and non-chiral quantum methods in realistic scenarios, including comparisons between successive versions of evolving databases.

Conclusion: This study reveals practical improvements for quantum thermal technologies.

Abstract: Coherence is an inherently quantum property that deeply affects microscopic processes, including thermalization phenomena. A striking example is the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), in which a system can exhibit anomalous relaxation, thermalizing faster from a state initially farther from equilibrium than from one closer. Here, we experimentally investigate the genuine QME and observe how the dynamics of a spin-1/2 system interacting with a heat sink can be sped-up to equilibrium. Furthermore, we apply the QME in a quantum Otto refrigerator, thereby increasing its cooling power. This proof-of-concept experiment unveils new practical paths for improving quantum thermal tasks.

We also present a possible extension of our approach to the phase sensitive case via a parametrization of POVMs on the complex Stiefel manifold which enables gradient based optimization restricted to this manifold.

Method: Establish symplectic basis; develop algebraic/stable models; introduce derived automorphisms.

Result: Detailed logical operator structure of tile codes; efficient construction via cellular automata; derived automorphism framework for fault tolerance.

Conclusion: Tile codes are promising for quantum computation with significant structural advances and practical implementation benefits.

Abstract: The recently introduced tile codes are a promising alternative to surface codes, combining two-dimensional locality with higher encoding efficiency. While surface codes are well understood in terms of their logical operators and boundary behavior, much less is known about tile codes. In this work, we establish a natural and precise description of their logical operator space. We prove that, under mild assumptions, any tile code admits a canonical symplectic basis of logical operators supported along lattice boundaries, which can be generated efficiently by a simple cellular automaton with the number of update rules only depending on the non-locality of the tile code. Further, we develop algebraic and algebro-geometric frameworks for tile codes, by resolving them by translationally invariant Pauli stabilizer models and showing that they arise as derived sections of a Koszul complex on $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$. Finally, we introduce the concept of derived automorphisms for quantum codes. These are automorphism-like operations that can exist even for codes that do not have symmetries. We explain how derived automorphisms can be implemented for tile codes in a low-overhead and fault-tolerant manner by extending the lattice on one side and shrinking it on the other. While this operation is trivial for the surface code, it induces a product of logical CNOT gates on the encoded information. Our results provide new structural insights into tile codes and lay the groundwork for tile codes as building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give noise-robust, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees of global $\varepsilon$-optimality for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver under explicit geometric conditions. For periodic ansatzes with bounded generators -- yielding a globally Lipschitz cost landscape on a toroidal parameter space -- we assume that the low-energy region containing the global minimum is a Morse--Bott submanifold whose normal Hessian has rank $r = O(\log p)$ for $p$ parameters, and which satisfies polynomial fiber regularity with respect to coordinate-aligned, embedded flats. This low-curvature-dimensional structure serves as a model for regimes in which only a small number of directions control energy variation, and is consistent with mechanisms such as strong parameter tying together with locality in specific multiscale and tied shallow architectures.
  Under this assumption, the sample complexity required to find an $\varepsilon$-optimal region with confidence $1-δ$ scales with the curvature dimension $r$ rather than the ambient dimension $p$. With probability at least $1-δ$, the algorithm outputs a region in which all points are $\varepsilon$-optimal, and at least one lies within a bounded neighborhood of the global minimum. The resulting complexity is quasi-polynomial in $p$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and logarithmic in $δ^{-1}$. This identifies a geometric regime in which high-probability global optimization remains feasible despite shot noise.

Result: 在20量子位的IBMQ Tokyo平台上测试，DIRSH在时间预算不同情况下都优于其他LightSABRE变种，减少了深度和交换次数。

Conclusion: 将分块分解与基于启发式的方法结合起来，利用 bandit参数调整，能够在NISQ设备上有效地为量子电路进行路由。

Abstract: This paper introduces the DIRSH algorithm for the Qubit Routing Problem (QRP), using a heuristic-guided randomized divide-and-conquer strategy. The method splits the circuit into chunks and optimizes each one with a stochastic selection of gates and swaps. It balances global search, via restarts and adaptive tuning of bandit parameters with depth-sensitive local pruning. Tested on RevLib benchmarks mapped to the 20-qubit IBMQ Tokyo topology, DIRSH outperformed three LightSABRE variants across different time budgets, achieving shorter depths and fewer swaps. These results confirm that combining chunk-based decomposition with bandit-driven heuristics is effective for routing quantum circuits on NISQ devices.

Motivation:  Quantum entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory and has significant implications in quantum computing and teleportation.

Method:  The paper uses the Schmidt decomposition, a mathematical method, to determine if a system is entangled, and applies this method to demonstrate quantum teleportation.

Result:  The use of Schmidt decomposition successfully shows that certain systems are entangled and enables the teleportation of quantum states.

Conclusion:  The paper effectively illustrates the role of quantum entanglement and its applications through the Schmidt decomposition and quantum teleportation.

Abstract: Quantum information theory is a rapidly growing area of math and physics that combines two independent theories, quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum entanglement is a concept that was first proposed in the EPR paradox. In quantum mechanics, particles can be in superposition, meaning they are in multiple different states at once. It is not until the particle is measured that it is forced into a single state. However, it is possible that particles can be tied to other particles, meaning that the measurement of one particle will determine the measurement of the other particle. Entanglement is at the very core of quantum information theory. It is one of the core pieces that allows for the massive increase in computing power. For this paper, we decided to focus on demonstrating the mathematical method (the Schmidt decomposition) for determining if a system is entangled, and a demonstration of quantum entanglement's use (quantum teleportation) as well as a quick look at how to extend the uses of the Schmidt decomposition.

Abstract: We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution refinement applied to both single-particle basis states as well as a spatial lattice grid. For basis refinement, we compute few-body ground states of the Busch model for interacting particles in a harmonic trap in one dimension. For lattice refinement, we compute Hartree-Fock nuclear states for a central Woods-Saxon potential in three dimensions, and we compute bound states and continuum states in a multi-species Hubbard model of fermions in one dimension. In all cases, the method is efficient and requires an adiabatic evolution time comparable to the inverse of the energy gap in the physical spectrum.

Conclusion: 该研究为生成高质量的 GKP 状态提供了一种有效的方法，对实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: We present an architecture for the generation of GKP states in which quadrature squeezing operations are used to control the average photon number statistics of probabilistic photon number measurements on Gaussian resource states. Specifically, we present an architecture employing a teleportation-based squeezing protocol and polynomial-gate applications integrated into a time-multiplexed multi-mode cluster state to generate cat states with high amplitudes, which are consequently used to generate GKP states with high quadrature effective squeezing. Compared to our previous work, in addition to using squeezing as a resource, the present architecture reduces damping and noise by minimizing the number of homodyne measurements required in GKP state generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these improvements - including dynamic input-state resetting and an improved breeding algorithm - by achieving a fault-tolerance threshold of 11.5 dB cluster squeezing using the RHG surface code for error correction, without requiring active switching or photon-number resource states.

Abstract: We present a gradient-based method to construct memory-efficient, high-fidelity, single-qubit gates for fluxonium qubits. These gates are constructed using a sequence of single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses that are sent to the qubit through either capacitive or inductive coupling. The schedule of SFQ pulses is constructed with an on-ramp and an off-ramp applied prior to and after a pulse train, where the pulses are spaced at intervals equal to the qubit period. We reduce the optimization problem to the scheduling of a fixed number of SFQ pulses in the on-ramp and solve it by relaxing the discretization constraint of the SFQ clock as an intermediate step, allowing the use of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimizer. Using this approach, gate fidelities of 99.99 % can be achieved for inductive coupling and 99.9 % for capacitive coupling, with leakage being the main source of coherent errors for both approaches.

Abstract: In this note, we conjecture and provide evidence that quantum gravity cobordism classes are trivialized by elementary generators with tension at most order 1 in Planck units. Motivated by the attractor mechanism and a number of key examples, we propose that there is always a regime in the field space of the EFT in which the intrinsic tension of such an object is at most Planckian. This work brings together kinematic and dynamical aspects of cobordism defects in the context of the Swampland program.

Abstract: Motivated by sparseness conditions for holographic CFTs, we investigate sparseness of modular forms, lattices, and codes. For this we investigate the free energy of such objects as their weight, dimension or size goes to infinity. We construct families of modular forms that are sparse, such as the Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(τ)$. We then investigate lattices that come from codes and introduce a sparseness condition for such lattices. We investigate the limit of lattices constructed from self-dual Reed-Muller codes and provide evidence that they are sparse in this sense.

Abstract: In this paper, using equivariant localization for foliations, we compute the on-shell action of a general class of supersymmetric solutions of five-dimensional gauged supergravity with vector multiplets. Unlike previous literature, we also allow for a non-trivial topology for the space-time as well as for the gauge fields. In practice, we achieve this by covering the spacetime manifold with patches and localizing in each patch. We derive a general formula for the on-shell action that depends on topological data only and can be used without a detailed knowledge of the solution. Our final result is relevant for the physically interesting examples of multi-center black holes, black rings and black lenses, topological solitons and Euclidean black saddles. We also show how to connect the topological data with the thermodynamic data: electrostatic potential, the magnetic fluxes and the possible flat connections of the solutions. Our formula for the on-shell action is derived in the context of gauged supergravity, but it is straightforward to take the ungauged limit. Thus, we reproduce known results for a large class of explicit asymptotically flat supersymmetric solutions, and we provide predictions for AdS solutions still to be found.

### [66] [Reconstructing the Gravitational Waveform from Its Probe Limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13835)
*Carlo Heissenberg,Rodolfo Russo*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Gravitational observables for binary systems simplify in the post-Minkowskian regime and can be reconstructed using specific symmetry properties to improve waveform modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding gravitational waveforms is crucial for detecting and analyzing binary systems in gravitational wave astronomy.

Method: The paper leverages post-Minkowskian expansions and particle interchange symmetry to reconstruct waveform approximations, combining amplitude integrands and tail formulas for improved accuracy.

Result: The authors successfully calculate probe-limit waveforms up to 10PN and extend them to 5PN for generic masses in the center-of-mass frame.

Conclusion: This work contributes to advancing high-precision waveform modeling for gravitational wave observations by simplifying the PN expansion process.

Abstract: Gravitational observables for binary systems exhibit a simple polynomial dependence on the masses $m_1$, $m_2$ of the two scattering objects when they are written in terms of the appropriate kinematic variables in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime. We point out that this property, combined with particle interchange symmetry, allows one to reconstruct the leading and subleading PM waveforms from their probe limit, $m_1 \gg m_2$. As an application, focusing on their re-expansion in the small-velocity or post-Newtonian (PN) regime, we calculate the probe-limit waveforms up to 10PN, and then exploit this observation to deduce from them the waveforms for generic masses in the center-of-mass frame up to 5PN. To this end, we employ both the amplitude-based waveform integrands and the tail formula. This combined approach simplifies substantially the PN expansion of the full subleading PM waveform.

Abstract: We compute three-loop corrections to the three-point form factor of the operator $\operatorname{tr}(φ^2)$ in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory. In particular, our result is valid beyond the leading-color limit and will consequently be an important input towards extending the amplitude-bootstrap program beyond the leading-color approximation. We find that our analytic formulae are strikingly compact expressions in terms of integer linear combinations of generalized polylogarithms of weight six.

### [68] [Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics and the Rayleigh-Jeans Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13943)
*Jorge Gamboa,Natalia Tapia Arellano*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores how Berry phases in Infrared Quantum Electrodynamics (IR-QED) can influence the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum.

Method: The authors develop a theoretical framework by interpreting soft photons as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds and use a functional Berry phase approach.

Result: The analysis concludes that the energy density of the CMB receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law, producing a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain.

Conclusion: The observed deviations in the CMB spectrum, as suggested by ARCADE 2 data, align with the theoretical predictions of IR-QED.

Abstract: Infrared quantum electrodynamics (IR-QED) acquires a natural geometric interpretation once soft photons are described as adiabatically transported electron-photon clouds. Within this framework, the relevant infrared structure is encoded in a functional Berry phase associated with the space of gauge connections, and the corresponding Berry corrections modify the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The infrared scaling symmetry of the Rayleigh-Jeans law leads to a simple renormalization-group equation whose solution determines the frequency dependence of an effective factor $F_{\rm eff}(ω)$ controlling the strength of the electron-photon cloud dressing. As a result, the energy density of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) receives a Berry-induced correction that scales as a power law and produces a frequency-dependent temperature excess in the radio domain. Although the exponent $γ$ governing this scaling behaviour is not fixed internally by the present formulation of IR-QED and must instead be determined phenomenologically, the existence and structure of the excess are genuine predictions of the theory. Remarkably, the resulting expression is extremely simple and naturally aligns with the deviations suggested by the ARCADE 2 data. Taken together, these results indicate that Berry phases in IR-QED may lead to observable consequences in the low-frequency tail of the CMB spectrum.

### [69] [Vortex stability in pseudo-Hermitian theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14300)
*R. A. Battye,S. J. Cotterill,P. Millington*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Pseudo-Hermitian field theories with PT-symmetric vacuum can exhibit metastable vortex solutions even when the model is within the stable parameter regime. The metastability arises from a small breaking of the antilinear symmetry due to the topological defect, leading to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion and inducing complex frequencies and exceptional points in the spectrum. This result suggests potential applications in cosmology and beyond high energy physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding metastable solutions in non-Hermitian field theories is crucial for exploring novel physical phenomena. This paper provides an example of how PT-symmetric theories can exhibit stability not explained by conventional Hermitian theories, which has implications for both high energy physics and cosmology.

Method: The analysis involves deriving equations of motion for fluctuations around the vortex in a PT-symmetric field theory, perturbing around the exact antilinear symmetric vacuum. Through linear stability analysis and numerical simulations, the authors identify the conditions under which the solutions become metastable.

Result: The vortex solutions are shown to exhibit metastability due to small symmetry-breaking induced by the topological defect. The equations of motion for fluctuations show exceptional-point structures and complex mode frequencies, allowing for long-lived configurations beyond conventional stability.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that pseudo-Hermitian field theories can have metastable solutions even in the stable regime of the vacuum symmetry. These results open new avenues for studying extended stability mechanisms in non-Hermitian systems, with potential applications in cosmology and high energy physics.

Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian (including $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) field theories support phenomenology that cannot be replicated in standard Hermitian theories. We describe a concrete example in which the vortex solutions that are realised in a prototypical pseudo-Hermitian field theory exhibit a novel metastability, despite the model parameters residing within the naively stable regime of exact antilinear symmetry of the vacuum theory. This instability is identified analytically and confirmed through numerical simulations, and it arises from the small breaking of the underlying antilinear symmetry of the pseudo-Hermitian theory due to the presence of the topological defect. This leads to spacetime-dependent parameters in the equations of motion governing fluctuations around the vortex, inducing non-trivial exceptional-point structures and complex frequencies within their spectrum. Aside from offering intriguing possibilities for cosmology, this result serves to illustrate the ability to produce long-lived metastable configurations in pseudo-Hermitian field theories of relevance beyond cosmology and high energy physics.

Result: 即使的小的违反因果性，能产生非零残留熵和持续的负性，模拟量子引力效应。

Conclusion: 弦行破坏经典因果性可能在黑洞信息动力学留下持久印记。

Abstract: We extend a four-qubit quantum circuit model of black hole evaporation that enforces semi-causality, a condition that allows information to enter a black hole but strictly forbids any information from escaping from the interior to outside through the horizon. In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics.

Result: 实验结果表明，当外加磁场强度超过5 Tesla时，合金材料完全表现出磁屏蔽行为，磁性被完全抑制。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，合金材料在强外加磁场下确实表现出磁屏蔽现象，这对于材料科学和超导体技术的发展具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: We derive the Seiberg-Witten map to first order in the non-commutativity parameter for D-branes in the presence of a large R-R background field. This result enables a systematic investigation of the commutative formulation of the corresponding Lagrangian. In the SU($N$) sector, the map introduces a non-local operator. In contrast, in the U(1) sector, this non-locality can be removed. This contrast suggests that the essential source of non-local behavior lies in the non-Abelian degrees of freedom. The commutative description obtained here offers further insight into both the Dirac-Born-Infeld structure and its possible extensions to the dynamics of M5-branes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this note, we consider specific scenarios of matter-gravity interaction based on the source theory to clarify the issue regarding the Gravitationally Induced Entanglement (GIE) protocol, which posits that the detection of quantum entanglement induced by a pure gravitational effect serves as a probe of quantum gravity. Thus, the GIE protocol implies that classical gravity cannot produce or mediate quantum entanglement, to which a recent paper \cite{Aziz:2025ypo} shows the opposite. In all three scenarios of matter-gravity interactions, including mini-superspace, semiclassical gravity, and stochastic gravity approaches, our results agree with the GIE protocol and its implications. More precisely, we show that the mesoscopic quantum bodies with their parities of mass quadrupoles interacting via Newtonian gravity can get entangled only if the parity of the gravitational tidal field sourced by the quantum body is also quantized. We also point out a possible loophole that could seemingly violate the GIE protocol due to the truncation of higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion by orders of the Newton constant.

Conclusion: 这是引力统一研究的重要进展，为理解强相互作用和引力关系提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy gravities with Internal Interactions is based on the following two facts. The first is that the tangent group of a curved manifold and the manifold itself do not necessarily have the same dimensions. The second is that both gravitational theories considered here have been formulated in a gauge theoretic way. Here we would like to start by reviewing the gauge theoretic approach of gravities commenting in particular their diffeomorphism invariance. Then we will review the construction of the Conformal Gravity and the Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravity using the gauge theoretic framework. Finally based on an extension of the four-dimensional tangent group we will present the Unification of both Gravities with the Internal Interactions. Both unified schemes will be examined further concerning their behaviour in low energies after suitable spontaneous symmetry breakings as well as the possible signals of the related cosmic strings in the gravitational waves.

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究具有非零旋转的渐近平面时空提供了新工具，并发现这些解及其对称性在平坦共形引力和扰动研究中有重要应用。

Abstract: We extend the Bondi formalism to describe asymptotically-flat spacetimes where the outgoing null geodesic congruence is not hypersurface-orthogonal, i.e. has a non-vanishing twist. In the Newman-Penrose formulation, the twist $\text{Im}(ρ)$ is sourced by a twist potential sitting in the transverse null dyad $(m,\bar{m})$, while in the metric formulation this potential arises from $g_{ra}\neq0$. We explain how to arrange and solve the Einstein equations for such generalized line elements, thereby providing an extension of the Bondi hierarchy to asymptotically-flat spacetimes with non-vanishing twist. We work out the twisting generalizations of all the well-known features pertaining to asymptotically-flat spacetimes in Bondi gauge, such as the solution space, the flux-balance laws, the asymptotic symmetries, and the transformation laws. The twist potential has a natural Carrollian interpretation as an Ehresmann connection, and gives rise to Carroll boosts as extra asymptotic symmetries. One of the advantages of the Bondi gauge with non-vanishing twist is that it allows to write algebraically special solutions in a manifestly finite radial expansion, and with a repeated principal null direction such that $Ψ_0=Ψ_1=0$. This is in particular the case for the Kerr-Taub-NUT solution. The asymptotic symmetries of algebraically special solutions also have a finite radial expansion, which enables to study the supertranslated Schwarzschild solution and its charges quite straightforwardly. We expect that these results will find applications in the development of flat holography for algebraically special solutions and in the study of their perturbations. We also study an analogue of the twist in three-dimensional spacetimes with non-vanishing cosmological constant, and find an 8-dimensional solution space which encompasses and generalizes the existing results in the literature.

TL;DR: -paper presents a method for finding characteristic decompositions for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) with applications to numerical simulations.-


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: numerical simulations of GRMHD are computationally challenging, and lack of efficient characteristic decompositions limits the use of accurate computational methods like full-wave Riemann solvers.-

Method: the paper introduces quasi-invertible transformations to derive characteristic decompositions, starting with simpler relativistic hydrodynamics before applying the method to GRMHD.-

Result: simplified characteristic decomposition for relativistic hydrodynamics and new decomposition for GRMHD when evolved with fluid in nuclear statistical equilibrium.-

Conclusion: this framework provides a foundation for efficient numerical methods in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations.

Abstract: The characteristic decomposition for GRMHD is not known in a form useful for current numerical simulations. This prevents us from using the most accurate known computational methods, such as full-wave Riemann solvers. In this paper, we present a new method of finding decompositions. The method is based on transformations from the comoving frame, where the fluid flow is simplest and the decomposition has been known for a long time. The key innovation we introduce is that of quasi-invertible transformations. In this first paper, we introduce these transformations using the simpler example of relativistic hydrodynamics. We recover the known decomposition for relativistic hydrodynamics in somewhat simpler form than previously derived, and without the need for computer algebra. A new result in this paper is the characteristic decomposition when the the evolution tracks the composition of a fluid in nuclear statistical equilibrium. In Paper II of this series, we apply a quasi-invertible transformation to derive the complete characteristic decomposition for GRMHD in the conserved variables used in simulations.

Abstract: We provide a construction of a new class of axisymmetric extremal isolated horizons admitting a structure of U(1)-principal fiber bundle over a two-sphere. In contrast to the previous examples, the null generators are assumed to be transversal to the bundle fibers. We impose the Einstein equations at the horizon and explicitly derive all intrinsic geometries of the extremal horizon, consisting of a two-sphere metric and a rotation 1-form, in the above class. The 2-geometries turn out to be equivalent to the classification of conically singular horizons with product topology. Both the rotating and non-rotating horizons are then embedded in the Plebański-Demiański spacetimes, which naturally admit horizons of this type. Furthermore, we compare our results with previously obtained solutions to the Einstein vacuum extremal horizon equation with cosmological constant and the solution of Petrov type D equation with transversal bundle structure.

Abstract: Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.

Abstract: Throughout this paper, we conduct our discussion by a partial review of Elko's Hermiticity, introducing the Hermitian formulation for interacting mass dimension one fermions based on Elko spinor. It includes pivotal observations about renormalizability and the study of some allowed interactions. Beyond these points, since dark-matter phenomenology is mainly connected to gravitation, we introduce original remarks on how the Hermitian prescription can be readily generalized to include curved space-time, considering the very definition of the Elko spinor structure. We establish the Elko dual as arising from the path-integral formulation of a more fundamental structure. It enables one to include a curved background space-time and also quantum gravity into our investigations.

Abstract: Light propagating from near a black hole horizon to the outside world is highly redshifted. In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three.

Abstract: We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.

Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{μν}\Box^{-2}R_{μν}$, $R^{μνσδ}\Box^{-2}R_{μνσδ}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{ΛCDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm.

*Chao Zhang,Tao Zhu*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The gamma-metric modifies the Schwarzschild metric by introducing a deformation parameter gamma, which influences the properties of periodic orbits and gravitational-wave radiation in the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to understand how deviations from spherical symmetry, as parameterized by gamma, affect the observed gravitational waves in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

Method: The study classifies periodic orbits using topological numbers (z, w, v) and investigates how gamma != 1 impacts the radii and angular momentum of these orbits. Gravitational waveforms are computed to correlate gamma deviations with waveform features.

Result: The research reveals that gamma deviations lead to altered orbital properties and more complex gravitational-wave patterns. This suggests that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals could constrain deviations from spherical symmetry, providing insights into gamma's impact.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the gamma-metric's deviations from the Schwarzschild solution manifest in distinct ways, particularly in the form of gravitational-wave signals and orbital behavior, offering a promising avenue for constraining gamma through gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: The gamma-metric, also known as Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, is a static, axially symmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations characterized by two parameters: mass and the deformation parameter gamma. It reduces to the Schwarzschild metric when gamma = 1. In this paper we explore potential signatures of the gamma-metric on periodic orbits and their gravitational-wave radiation. Periodic orbits are classified by a rotational number specified by three topological numbers (z, w, v), each triple corresponding to characteristic zoom-whirl behavior. We show that deviations from gamma=1 alter the radii and angular momentum of bound orbits and thereby shift the (z, w, v) taxonomy. We also compute representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits and demonstrate that gamma != 1 can induce phase shifts and amplitude modulations correlated with changes in the zoom-whirl structure. In particular, larger zoom numbers lead to increasingly complex substructures in the waveforms, and finite deviations from gamma=1 can significantly modify these features. Our results indicate that precise measurements of waveform morphology from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals may constrain deviations from spherical symmetry encoded in gamma.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=α\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+α)$, with $α$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto ρ_m$, $f \propto ρ_{de}$, and $f \propto ρ_m + ρ_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(Ω_{de}, Ω_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.

Conclusion: 论文展示了通过引入场强可以解决k-essence理论中的紧致物不存在问题

Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $φ$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(φ, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $μ(φ) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $μ(φ)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)<{\cal C}<{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $μ(φ)>0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.

Abstract: We give the first general construction of solutions of the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler equations, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV-)equation, with prescribed density functions allowed to be discontinuous and non-uniform; these solutions describe stellar phase transitions in General Relativity. Boundedness of the resulting pressure functions solving the TOV-equations, from the boundary down to the stellar center, is obtained by identifying a novel condition on the prescribed density, in generalization of the classical Buchdahl limit. Moreover, we introduce a new necessary condition for the existence of such bounded pressure functions, which in the special case of a uniform density state reduces to the classical Buchdahl limit on the stellar mass-radius relationship. We present various examples to study the stellar mass-radius relationships resulting from our new conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the accelerating phase of the Universe within the context of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$, $L_m$, and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar, matter Lagrangian, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. We focus on a particular form of modified gravity defined by $f(R,L_m,T) = R - μL_m T - γ$, with $μ$ and $γ$ being positive constants. The matter sector is characterized by the Lagrangian density $L_m = -ρ$, where $ρ$ denotes the energy density of the cosmological fluid. We conduct an in-depth examination of the model using phase space analysis, thoroughly evaluating the evolution of cosmological solutions with dynamical system techniques. The results is illustrated through graphs in the phase space, the characteristics of critical points and the stable attractors within the proposed modified gravity $f(R,L_m,T)$ cosmological framework. We investigate the transition from the initial decelerating phase of the universe to its current accelerating phase. The behaviour of the EoS, deceleration parameter with the appropriate initial conditions have been investigated.

Abstract: The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding environment is fundamental to understanding galactic evolution. This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.

Abstract: We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.

Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional magnetic materials has provided an ideal platform for exploring physical phenomena in the two-dimensional limit. However, intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials have been rarely reported, limiting systematic studies of their electronic properties. The discovery of novel intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnets and the development of robust synthesis strategies, therefore, remain significant challenges. Here, we report the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of CrOCl monolayer films and nanosheets that exhibit excellent air stability. The CrOCl morphology is tunable, ranging from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional flower-like structures, with lateral sizes ranging from several microns to continuous monolayer films. Structural characterization confirms the materials composition and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, magnetic measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal a Néel temperature for CrOCl of ~14 K. This work provides a reliable route for preparing two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.

Conclusion: V形结构下的磁电效应由时间反演对称性 presence/absence 决定，不仅工作中理解微纳结构中的多极现象，也指导 bulk 系统中形状效应的开发.mulitpole 展开机制需要仔细研究。

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the shape dependence and microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric effect, including both nonmagnetic (Edelstein-type) and magnetic origins, in a V-shaped one-dimensional chain model. Numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula reveal that the magnitude of the nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response reaches a maximum at an apex angle of $θ\approx 0.6π$. To clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior, we construct a low-energy effective Hamiltonian by projecting onto the $s$-orbital subspace and demonstrate that the polarity induced by the V-shaped geometry manifests as an effective spin--orbit interaction. An analytical derivation of the Green's function shows that the geometric effect appears as a $T$-matrix contribution, reflecting the local breaking of translational symmetry at the V-shaped edge. Furthermore, by employing a multipole-basis representation, we identify the selection rules that govern the magnetoelectric tensor and reveal that the coupling between the effective spin--orbit interaction and the orbital angular momentum generated across the apex plays an essential role. The resulting angular dependence, $\sinθ\sin{θ/2}$, peaks at $θ= 2\tan^{-1}\sqrt{2} \approx 0.608π$, in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze a ferromagnetic V-shaped model including the Zeeman interaction and show that the magnetic-driven magnetoelectric response originates from the spin magnetization induced by the coupling between the electric-field--driven charge-potential gradient and the Zeeman term. These findings demonstrate that the V-shaped geometry gives rise to distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and provide a microscopic framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems.

TL;DR:  cryocrystals' low-temperature isochoric heat capacity can be scaled using a universal function that relates heat capacity anomaly magnitude and characteristic temperature T_max, linked to the first van Hove singularity in the phonon spectrum. T_max shifts systematically with molar volume, reflecting vibrational properties and scaling due to phonon Brillouin zone contributions, bridging thermodynamics and vibrational density of states.

Motivation:  Progressing from experimental observations of anomalies in heat capacity at low temperatures in cryocrystals, fundamental understanding of lattice dynamics and phonon contributions to thermal properties of crystals is being explored.

Method:  Theoretical analysis using universal scaling functions and phonon spectrum analysis, combined with consideration of vibrational density of states and molar volume effects.

Result:  A universal scaling function explains the relationship between heat capacity anomaly, T_max and molar volume, linking phonon anomalies to vibrational singularities and scaling in crystal classes.

Conclusion:  Lattice dynamics and phonon properties are key contributors to low-temperature heat capacity anomalies in crystals; a universal scaling approach is needed to predict such behaviors across crystal classes.

Abstract: The low-temperature isochoric heat capacity of cryocrystals was scaled using the universal scaling function. This universality links the magnitude of the anomaly and the characteristic temperature of the hump $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ in heat capacity, which is related to the first van Hove singularity in the phonon spectrum. For atomic, molecular, and quantum cryocrystals, $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ systematically shifts with molar volume, reflecting Brillouin zone scaling and revealing a common vibrational origin. These findings for the scaling function bridge thermodynamics with the vibrational density of states, highlighting fundamental universality in lattice dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding spin polarization in magnetic systems without an electric field has potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

Method: The study utilized a tight-binding model and the Green's function method to analyze a helix with non-uniform magnetic moments.

Result: The results show significant spin polarization under both correlated and uncorrelated non-uniformity, across a range of physical parameters.

Conclusion: This opens new avenues for achieving spin selectivity in zero net magnetization systems, potentially leading to novel functionalities in future materials.

Abstract: The occurrence of a finite mismatch between the up and down spin energy channels due to the application of an electric field, leading to the generation of a polarized spin current from an unpolarized beam in antiferromagnetic materials, has already been established. But, in this work, we report for the first time that even in the absence of any electric field, spin polarization can be achieved. We choose a tight-binding antiferromagnetic helix, where the strengths of magnetic moments at different lattice sites are non-uniform. The non-uniformity is introduced in two distinct forms, correlated and uncorrelated, and in each case we find a high degree of spin polarization. The Greens formalism is used to compute the results under various input conditions, and the results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters. Our analysis can open up a new direction of getting spin selectivity in different magnetic systems with zero net magnetization, in the absence of an electric field.

Abstract: We study the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in its ultrathin limit i.e. when the thickness is of the same order as the surface state penetration depth. It is expected that in this limit a hybridization gap opens at the Dirac point, which gives rise to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) or insulating phase, depending on the material thickness. We fabricate (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with a thicknesses of 6 and 9 nm and measure an insulating phase around the Dirac point for low bias and at sub-Kelvin temperatures only in samples fabricated from the 6 nm films, which indicates the presence of a hybridization gap. The effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the hybridization gap is studied but remains partially unresolved. The results form an important step towards experimentally realizing the quantum spin Hall state via hybridization in ultrathin films of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, yet, they also expose a knowledge gap regarding transport measurements in these systems.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium charge transport through a trimer molecular transistor composed of three quantum dots arranged in a triangular geometry, which is placed on a substrate, has been studied in the presence of electron electron and electron phonon interactions. The entire system is described by an extended Anderson Holstein Caldeira Leggett Hamiltonian, in which the Caldeira Leggett term accounts for phonon damping arising from the coupling between the molecular vibrations and the substrate phonon bath. The electron phonon interaction is treated nonperturbatively using the Lang Firsov canonical transformation, while the electron electron interaction is incorporated at the mean field level. Keldysh nonequilibrium Greens function framework is used to study the transport properties, allowing us to calculate the spectral function, tunneling current, ad differential conductance of the trimer molecular transistor. The formalism enables systematic evaluation of the effects of Coulomb interaction, electron phonon coupling, and dissipation on the devices electronic transport characteristics.

Abstract: Nanoscale conductors are interesting for thermoelectrics because of their particular spectral features connecting separated heat and particle currents. Multiterminal devices in the quantum regime benefit from phase-coherent phenomena, which turns the thermoelectric effect nonlocal, and from tunable single-particle interactions. This way one can define quantum thermocouples which convert an injected heat current into useful power in an isothermal conductor, or work as refrigerators. Additionally, efficient heat management devices can be defined. We review recent theoretical and experimental progress in the research of multiterminal thermal and thermoelectric quantum transport leading to proposals of autonomous quantum heat engines and thermal devices.

Motivation: Understanding surface topography and imaging contrast in electron microscopy is crucial for advancing nanotechnology and materials science.

Method: A physical model was developed considering SE emission and magnetic field interactions.

Result: The model enables more reliable interpretation of SE images and supports 3D surface reconstruction.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for enhanced imaging techniques and applications in 3D surface analysis.

Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging offers a powerful complementary capabilities to conventional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) by providing surface-sensitive, pseudo-3D topographic information. However, contrast interpretation of such images remains empirical due to complex interactions of emitted SE with the magnetic field in the objective field of TEM. Here, we propose an analytical physical model that takes into account the physics of SE emission and interaction of the emitted SEs with magnetic field. This enables more reliable image interpretation and potentially lay the foundation for novel 3D surface reconstruction algorithms.

Abstract: Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.

Abstract: Layered van der Waals crystals of topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe2As2, EuSn2As2, EuSn2P2, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about 5% up to the spin-polarization field. Although this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that is inherent in AFM metals and is based on violation the binary T2 symmetry. It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.

Abstract: We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.

Conclusion: CMRT 为理解 rare 地球元素化合物的超新质态和相变提供了强有力的理论框架，未来可用于预测更多相关化合物的相变和电子行为。

Abstract: We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.

Benchmarking on the single-band Hubbard model for the Bethe lattice demonstrates quantitative accuracy across metallic, strongly correlated, and insulating regimes.

Abstract: 4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.

Abstract: A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity spectra of the rare-earth (RE) dodecaborides RB12 (R- Ho, Er and Tm) and Tm1-xYbxB12 substitutional solid solutions was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability. We demonstrate that even at room temperature the MIT is accompanied with simultaneous decrease in concentration of Drude-type electrons and redistribution of carriers to localized JT collective modes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.

Motivation: The paper likely explores the universality of deformations in elastic solids, possibly to understand material behavior under various symmetries.

Method: Mathematical analysis focusing on hyperelasticity and Cauchy elasticity for different symmetry classes, proving equivalence of universal deformations.

Result: Universal deformations and material preferred directions are identical across symmetry classes, matching isotropic results.

Conclusion: This finding simplifies the understanding of universal deformations by showing they are symmetry-independent.

Abstract: In this paper we study universal deformations in anisotropic Cauchy elasticity. We show that the universality constraints of hyperelasticity and Cauchy elasticity for transversely isotropic, orthotropic, and monoclinic solids are equivalent. This implies that for each of these symmetry classes the universal deformations and the corresponding universal material preferred directions of hyperelastic and Cauchy elastic solids are identical. This is consistent with previous findings for isotropic solids. Universal deformations and material preferred directions are therefore independent of the existence or absence of a strain energy function.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The displacement current, introduced by Maxwell, has led to persistent confusion regarding its role in generating magnetic fields. To find a new way to understand classical magnetism, in this work, the displacement current is first decomposed into a localized internal part and an external field component by developing a discal regularization over the dipole distribution. Due to a surprising cancellation of the electric current by the internal displacement current, the magnetic field in the Coulomb gauge can be reformulated, in terms of the external component of the displacement current, as an instantaneous Biot-Savart law. The new expression allows for a reinterpretation of the generation of magnetic fields, viewing it as a magnetic effect related to the external displacement current, rather than directly to the electric current. The consistency of the Biot-Savart law with the Ampère-Maxwell law is thus confirmed, eliminating a dogged dispute in history. This result offers a potential recognition of the displacement current enigma. The regularization method is also applied to the polarization model to develop and refine the Clausius-Mossotti equation within the special Wigner-Seitz primitive-cell regularization.

Abstract: We investigate phase space transport in a two-dimensional stretched caldera potential using the Origin-Fate Map (OFM) framework, complemented by Lagrangian Descriptor (LD) analysis. The caldera potential, a model for reaction dynamics with multiple exit channels, is adjusted by a stretching factor lambda that controls the directional bias of the four-saddle landscape. Several OFMs are constructed for two Poincare surfaces of section using forwards and backwards symplectic integration to assign each initial condition a channel of origin and fate. Our results reproduce the highly symmetric lambda = 1.0 patterns reported in Hillebrand et al. (Phys. Rev. E 108, 024211, 2023), and reveal, for smaller lambda, pronounced channel imbalance, figure-eight transport loops, and complex mixed-channel chaotic regions. Long-time integrations show a reduction of trapped regions with boundaries that exhibit self-similarity under deep zoom, revealing fractal-like structures. High-resolution OFMs and LD gradient maps uncover lobe dynamics and manifold structures that govern transport, showing near-perfect alignment between LD ridges and OFM boundaries.

Abstract: We experimentally show that an electric dipole moment of more than 1 Debye can be induced in the dysprosium (Dy) atom, in a long-lived state that is about 17513 cm$^{-1}$ above the ground state. This metastable state is part of a strongly coupled opposite-parity doublet. Using optically detected microwave spectroscopy in an atomic beam, we determine the approximately 1.12 cm$^{-1}$ doublet spacing for the five stable bosonic isotopes of Dy with kHz-level accuracy. From the shift of the microwave transition frequency in low electric fields (below 150 V/cm) and from optical spectra in high electric fields (up to 150 kV/cm), a reduced transition dipole moment of 7.65 $\pm$ 0.05 Debye between the doublet states is extracted. In high electric fields the doublet interacts with a third state at 17727 cm$^{-1}$, that connects to the ground state via an electric-dipole transition. The three-state Stark interaction enables preparation of Dy atoms in the metastable state via single-photon excitation from the ground state.

Abstract: Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $Ω/Λ$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the interaction of PIM-1 with nitroaromatic explosives using molecular orbital theory and experiments, showing that PIM-1 can detect TNT with good sensitivity and selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to explore how PIM-1, a type of thin film sensor, can detect nitroaromatic explosives, which is important for improving explosive detection technology.

Method: The research involves growing PIM-1 thin films, exposing them to DNT and TNT, measuring their absorption and emission spectra, and using electronic-structure calculations to understand the interactions between PIM-1 and the explosives.

Result: The study found that the microporous polymer interacts with nitroaromatic molecules through specific molecular interactions, and the electronic properties of the polymer change when it binds with these analytes. The response of PIM-1 to TNT was found to be more significant than to non-explosive molecules like benzene.

Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that PIM-1-based sensors can be used for detecting TNT with good sensitivity and selectivity, which could lead to practical applications in explosive detection.

Abstract: This work investigates the molecular-level interactions of a fluorescent microporous polymer (PIM-1) with nitroaromatic explosives, in the context of thin film explosive sensors. Thin films of the PIM-1 were exposed to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and their steady-state absorption and emission spectra measured. For comparison, the response of PIM-1 to non-explosive molecules such as benzene (BN) was also explored. Complementary electronic-structure calculations were used to predict absorption and emission spectra and to determine binding energies for the PIM-1-analyte complexes. The calculations agree well with experiment and reveal that association of nitroaromatic analyte molecules with PIM-1 alters the energy levels and the arrangements of frontier orbitals, indicating significant molecular interactions. Calculations show that the electronic properties and photo-excited electron transfer can be described by interaction with a single repeat unit of the polymer. The molecular binding, however, involves interaction with at least three repeat units, with the DNT or TNT molecule binding into a pocket in the contorted structure of the microporous polymer. Together, the experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that PIM-1 is a promising platform for selective nitroaromatic detection and provide molecular design principles that could improve sensitivity and selectivity in future sensor materials.

Abstract: The details of multiple charge transfer within or among molecules (including the accompanying molecular structure evolution and energy distribution) are typically not accessible on a single molecule level in experiments targeting complex condensed chemical or biological systems. In order to gather such detailed insight, small prototype systems that cover the essence of such processes need to be identified and investigated. Here, we employ a small system consisting of a combination of covalent and van der Waals bonds for our studies, namely N2Ar dimers. We use synchrotron radiation to site-selectively enable the charge transfer processes and perform a coincidence measurement of the resulting electrons and ions. In combination with ab initio calculations, this approach enables a step-by-step tracking of the charge transfer and fragmentation dynamics. We find that ultrafast structural evolution of the dimer can trigger a second CT, thereby opening complex reaction pathways, in which electrons transfer back and forth between Ar and N2, and nonadiabatic transitions occur twice through conical intersections. These results demonstrate that multiple CT-induced transitions, particularly in such a simple dimer system, provide benchmark insights into the mechanisms of nonadiabatic reactions in complex natural systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to bridge the gap between nanoprecipitation's theoretical principles and practical applications, showcasing its versatility and potential in advanced nanomaterial design.

Method: The paper employs a systematic review methodology, integrating recent research advancements to provide an in-depth analysis of stimulus-assisted nanoprecipitation. It evaluates various stimuli and mixing technologies alongside their impact on nanoparticle properties.

Result: The key findings include the effectiveness of integrating stimuli with mixing technologies to achieve better control over nanoparticle characteristics, as well as insights into multiscale modeling, design rules, and data-driven optimization frameworks.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for continued research to enhance the theoretical understanding and industrial applications of nanoprecipitation.

Abstract: Nanoprecipitation, the rapid solvent-displacement route to nanoscale phase separation, has matured from a simple batch operation into a versatile platform for nanomaterial synthesis. This review synthesizes recent progress in stimulus-assisted nanoprecipitation, wherein externally applied triggers (ultrasonic, electrical, supergravity, thermal, chemical, and photonic/other stimuli) are integrated with contemporary mixing technologies (batch, flash, microfluidic, membrane and high-shear reactors) to decouple and selectively control over nucleation, growth kinetics, and assembly processes. These methods allow for the precise tuning of the size, morphology, stability and functionality of nanoparticles (NPs), thereby broadening their applications in drug delivery, catalysis and materials science. We distill mechanistic principles by which each stimulus alters local supersaturation, chain mobility, interfacial instabilities, or droplet/film microreactor dynamics, and compare advantages and limitations by surveying research works from recent years. We also explore the potential development trends of multiscale coupling models, design rules for stimulus-compatible continuous reactors, and adoption of data-driven optimization frameworks to expand the capabilities of nanoprecipitation for advanced nanomaterial design.

Abstract: This paper presents the setup assembled to characterize and measure the spatial and timing resolutions of AC-coupled Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (AC-LGADs), using a 1060 nm laser source to deposit initial charges with a defined calibration methodology. The results were compared to those obtained with a 120 GeV proton beam. Despite the differences in the charge deposition mechanism between the laser and proton beam, the spatial and temporal resolutions were found to be compatible between the two sources after calibration. With 4D tracking detectors expected to play a vital role in upcoming collider experiments, we foresee this work as a way to evaluate the performance of semiconductor sensors that can augment testbeam measurements and accelerate R$\&$D efforts. Additionally, simulation studies using Silvaco TCAD and Weightfield2 were carried out to understand the various contributing factors to the total time resolution in AC-LGAD sensors, measured using the laser source.

Abstract: Thermal neutron detectors are crucial to a wide range of applications, including nuclear safety and security, cancer treatment, space research, non-destructive testing, and more. However, neutrons are notoriously difficult to capture due to their absence of charge, and only a handful of isotopes have a sufficient neutron cross-section. Meanwhile, commercially available $^3$He gas filled proportional counters suffer from depleting $^3$He feedstocks and complex device structures. In this work, we explore the potential of a carborane containing conjugated polymer ($o$CbT$_2$-NDI) as a thermal neutron detector. The natural abundance of $^{10}$B in such a polymer enables intrinsic thermal neutron capture of the material, making it the first demonstration of an organic semiconductor with such capabilities. In addition, we show that thermal neutron detection can be achieved also by adding a $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitiser additive to the analogous carborane-free polymer PNDI(2OD)2T, whereas unsensitised PNDI(2OD)2T control devices only respond to the fast neutron component of the radiation field. This approach allows us to disentangle the fast and thermal neutron responses of the devices tested and compare the relative performance of the two approaches to thermal neutron detection. Both the carborane containing and the $^{10}$B$_4$C sensitised devices displayed enhancement due to thermal neutrons, above that of the unsensitised polymer. The detector response is found to be linear with flux up to $1.796\,\times\,10^7\,$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ n$_{th}\bar{v}$ and saturates at high drive biases. This study demonstrates the viability of carboranyl polymers as neutron detectors, highlights the inherent chemical tuneability of organic semiconductors, and opens the possibility of their application to a number of different low-cost, scalable, and easily processable detector technologies.

Abstract: We report on the scintillation characterization of a 1 cm^3 CsI(Tl) crystal coupled to a 6 x 6 mm^2 SiPM read out with a custom transimpedance amplifier at cryogenic temperatures. The crystal was prepared with optical-grade surfaces and enclosed in a multi layer shielding system to suppress ambient light and background radiation. The detector response was studied at temperatures ranging from 100 K to room temperature. A figure of merit, defined as the ratio of the 59.5 keV peak position to the baseline resolution, showed a maximum at 175 K, indicating optimal photon detection efficiency. Pulse shape analysis demonstrated temperature-dependent variations in scintillation decay. At 175 K, the baseline resolution was sigma ~ 1 keV, corresponding to an effective threshold of ~ 3 keV. These results confirm the capability of the CsI(Tl) SiPM system to operate at low thresholds for rare-event searches and low-energy particle detection.

Conclusion: 量子效应对病毒过程至关重要，需要引入超对称量子力学方法研究。

Abstract: Classical computational methods, such as molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, have long been the standard for modeling viral structure and function. However, these approaches may overlook crucial quantum phenomena that operate at the nanoscale, particularly within the highly-compacted genetic material of the viral capsid. The confined, high-density environment of genetic material within the capsid strongly suggests that quantum confinement effects play a significant, yet unexplored, role in viral processes. This study introduces a novel quantum approach using Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics (SQM) to investigate the quantum confinement effects on viruses. In this paper, the viral capsid environment is modeled using the Pariacoto virus, a model system well-suited for this analysis due to its specific structural properties. The findings reveal that quantum effects are not merely marginal but essential for understanding key processes inside the capsid, providing new insights beyond the scope of classical physics.

Abstract: By integrating the principles of kirigami cutting and data-driven modeling, this study aims to develop a personalized, rapid, and low-cost design and fabrication pipeline for creating body-conformable surfaces around the knee joint. The process begins with 3D scanning of the anterior knee surface of human subjects, followed by extracting the corresponding skin deformation between two joint angles in terms of longitudinal strain and Poisson's ratio. In parallel, a machine learning model is constructed using extensive simulation data from experimentally calibrated finite element analysis. This model employs Gaussian Process (GP) regression to relate kirigami cut lengths to the resulting longitudinal strain and Poisson's ratio. With an R2 score of 0.996, GP regression outperforms other models in predicting kirigami's large deformations. Finally, an inverse design approach based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is used to generate kirigami patch designs that replicate the in-plane skin deformation observed from the knee scans. This pipeline was applied to three human subjects, and the resulting kirigami knee patches were fabricated using rapid laser cutting, requiring only a business day from knee scanning to kirigami patch delivery. The low-cost, personalized kirigami patches successfully conformed to over 75 percent of the skin area across all subjects, establishing a foundation for a wide range of wearable devices. The study demonstrates this potential through an impact-resistant kirigami foam patch, which not only conforms to dynamic knee motion but also provides joint protection against impact. Finally, the proposed design and fabrication framework is generalizable and can be extended to other deforming body surfaces, enabling the creation of personalized wearables such as protective gear, breathable adhesives, and body-conformable electronics.
