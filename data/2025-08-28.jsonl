This has been motivated by the high quality of data collected recently\nby programs such as the International Space Station (ISS), by the fundamental\nimportance of the topic, and by the unsatisfactory state of our understanding\nof the actual source of cosmic rays. A ``minor'' change in the Newtonian\ngravitational formulation converts solar production of high energy cosmic rays\nfrom ``impossible'' to ``likely'', without much disrupting the vast existent\ndomain of well understood astronomical gravitational processes. This change\nenables the sun to ``capture'' protons of energy so high that they would,\notherwise, escape the solar system. This change in Newton's gravitational\nformula would disrupt current cosmological understanding of missing mass and\ndark energy. With this changed understanding of gravity, it has been quite easy\nto produce a semi-quantitative understanding of the solar origin of cosmic rays\nup to energies at least as great as $10^6$\\,GeV/nucleon that have by now been\ndetected and measured so persuasively. A ``Double Slingshot'' mechanism is\nproposed according to which at least a substantial fraction of all cosmic rays\ncould have begun their life within the solar system. Accelerator-based nuclear\nastrophysics is promoted, beginning with the functioning of an ``{\\rm E}\\&{\\rm\nM}'' storage ring for laboratory-based study of processes such as ${\\rm 6LI} +\n{\\rm 7Li} \\rightarrow {\\rm 13C} + \\gamma$. Especially to be emphasized are\nexperiments made possible by ''rear-end collisions'' between nuclear isotopes\nof two different types traveling simultaneously at different velocities in the\nsame direction in the same storage ring. This amounts to ``studying nuclear\nphysics in a moving frame of reference''."}

One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of\nthe hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and\ntheoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms\nassociated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive.\nHere, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase\nphotoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events\nleading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The\nprocess begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific\ntopological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed\nby two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen\natom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100\nfemtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving\nrise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated\nexcess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast\ncoupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the\nformation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can\nsurvive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of\nvisible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the\ninterpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured\nover the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical\nand experimental fronts."}

The advantage of the proposed formalism in comparison with the\ncanonical theory stems from the application of Tucker decomposition format to\nthe ground- and excited-states triply-excited amplitudes tensors.

The Tlalpan Interpretation (QTI) proposes that the\nwavefunction collapse is not a primitive, axiomatic rule but an emergent\nphenomenon, a spontaneous breaking of time symmetry triggered by amplification\nand record creation. The novelty of QTI lies in its embedding of collapse\nwithin the conceptual language of critical phenomena in statistical physics.\nThe theory introduces measurable parameters (the amplification fraction, the\nrecord asymmetry, and the retrocausal coherence time) that serve as order\nparameters describing the quantum-classical transition. Collapse is thus\ncharacterized not as a mysterious fiat but as a phase transition, with\nthresholds and scaling laws analogous to magnetization in ferromagnets. This\nperspective allows the interpretation to retain microscopic time symmetry and\nspatial locality, while attributing quantum correlations and Bell-type\nviolations to retrocausal boundary constraints rather than instantaneous action\nat a distance. Collapse corresponds to the granularization of trajectories: the\nconversion of smooth, time-symmetric quantum evolution into discrete,\nirreversible records. Most importantly, QTI is testable. It predicts: (1) sharp\nthreshold-like disappearance of interference when amplification exceeds a\ncritical value, (2) anomalously fast decay of reversibility in chaotic optical\ncavities compared with regular ones, and (3) qualitatively new interference\nfringes in a time-symmetric generalization of Moshinsky's diffraction in time.\nIf confirmed, these predictions would place collapse squarely in the realm of\nthermodynamic processes, removing the last \"mystical\" postulate from quantum\ntheory."}

Moreover, owing to the large size of the detectors, energy\ndeposits can produce vastly different phonon propagation patterns depending on\ntheir location in the substrate, resulting in a strong position dependence in\nthe readout-channel pulse shapes. Both of these effects can degrade the energy\nresolution and consequently diminish the dark matter search sensitivity of the\nexperiment if not accounted for properly. We present a new algorithm for pulse\nreconstruction, mathematically formulated to take into account correlated noise\nand pulse shape variations. This new algorithm fits N readout channels with a\nsuperposition of M pulse templates simultaneously - hence termed the N$\\times$M\nfilter. We describe a method to derive the pulse templates using principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and to extract energy and position information using a\ngradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). We show that these new N$\\times$M and\nGBDT analysis tools can reduce the impact from correlated noise sources while\nimproving the reconstructed energy resolution for simulated mono-energetic\nevents by more than a factor of three and for the 71Ge K-shell electron-capture\npeak recoils measured in a previous version of SuperCDMS called CDMSlite to $<$\n50 eV from the previously published value of $\\sim$100 eV. These results lay\nthe groundwork for position reconstruction in SuperCDMS with the N$\\times$M\noutputs."}

In the layered\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a\nuniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover\nfrom thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of\nquantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the\nmicroscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that\nsingle-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle\ntransitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration\nrates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is\nrescaled as $T \\to h_x^n T$ with $n \\approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of\nfirst- and second-order single-particle processes.

Single-photon MIR imaging offers a label-free, non-invasive\nalternative, yet its adoption is hindered by the lack of efficient,\nroom-temperature MIR single-photon detectors.

This\napproach enables MIR spectral imaging using cost-effective, visible-wavelength\nsilicon single-photon avalanche diodes (Si-SPADs), supporting room-temperature,\nlow-noise, and high-efficiency operation. Time-correlated photon pairs\ngenerated via SPDC suppress classical intensity noise, enabling near\nshot-noise-limited hyperspectral imaging.

In the layered\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a\nuniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover\nfrom thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of\nquantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the\nmicroscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that\nsingle-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle\ntransitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration\nrates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is\nrescaled as $T \\to h_x^n T$ with $n \\approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of\nfirst- and second-order single-particle processes.

Incorporating the bound\nmodes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this\nphenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free\nenergy and entropy that are valid across all phases.
