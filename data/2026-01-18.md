### [1] [Trapping $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ Flux in Metals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09847)
*Zohar Komargodski,Fedor K. Popov*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 报告了一种新磁通量子化现象，发现金属在磁场影响下会捕获0或h/(2e)的磁通量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究材料中磁场和磁通量的量子效应

Method: 通过研究自由携带者受到的磁力，并考虑到磁通的量子化

Result: 金属中被束缚的磁通量为0或h/(2e)。当磁体被移动时，出现能隙均匀分布，磁通被束缚。当磁体被关闭时，存在永久的局部平衡电流

Conclusion: 导体对磁通的束缚效应表现出强磁滞特性。在无外磁场时，导体表现出磁阻特性，即与磁场无关的异常磁滞回环；当conducting medium被磁通穿透和环绕，并且磁场被缓慢关闭时，导体出现与外界无关的磁滞回环。

Abstract: We report on a new flux quantization phenomenon in metals. We study the response of normal metals to the presence of localized magnetic flux. We find that, due to backreaction effects, the metal traps 0 flux or $\tfrac{h}{2e}$ flux (half flux). We exhibit this effect both for metals pierced by magnetic solenoids and metals wrapping a magnetic solenoid. In the latter case we demonstrate the trapping of magnetic flux analytically. Furthermore, we find that as the solenoid is adiabatically turned off, a logarithmically enhanced localized equilibrium current persists, reflecting perfect defect-diamagnetism of the Fermi gas.

### [2] [Composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid in a half-filled Chern band](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09924)
*Zhengyan Darius Shi,Pavel A. Nosov*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper discusses a new phase of matter, the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL), which arises in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with $C_3$ symmetry. This phase exhibits unique properties such as incompressibility, quantized Hall conductance, and topological ground state degeneracy. It also has distinct transport properties, such as metallic $T$-linear specific heat and non-analytic $|m{q}|^3$ contributions to the structure factor. The CBFL offers a new avenue for understanding gapless topological phases beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors propose a novel phase of matter by considering composite fermions in Chern bands without external magnetic fields, inspired by recent experiments and numerical studies suggesting the possibility of an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL). This work broadens the understanding of topological phases and their potential for hosting exotic states.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis based on composite fermion theory, numerical simulations, and experimental observations from platforms such as twisted bilayer graphene and other 2D materials. The authors leverage insights from quantum Hall physics and topological phases to predict the existence of the CBFL in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with $C_3$ symmetry.

Result: The theoretical framework leads to the identification of the CBFL, characterized by neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. Key results include the incompressibility of the phase, quantized Hall conductance, absence of quantum oscillations, and topological ground state degeneracy. Additionally, the phase exhibits unique transport properties, such as metallic behavior with $T$-linear specific heat and non-analytic contributions to the equal-time structure factor $S(m{q})$.

Conclusion: The discovery of the CBFL represents a significant advance in the understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands. This work opens new possibilities for exploring exotic electronic states and their potential applications in quantum technologies. The CBFL is a promising candidate for hosting new types of orders and exotic excitations, furthering the exploration of topological matter in realistic 2D systems.

Abstract: The composite Fermi liquid (CFL) in the half-filled Landau level is a cornerstone of the quantum Hall phase diagram. Recent experiments and numerics indicate that an anomalous composite Fermi liquid (ACFL) can also arise at half filling of a Chern band without any external magnetic field, opening new possibilities for paired states of composite fermions beyond the fully gapped Pfaffian phase. We argue that in inversion-asymmetric Chern bands with lattice rotational symmetry reduced to $C_3$, as realized in experimental platforms where signatures of the ACFL have been observed, composite fermions can form a superconductor with neutral gapless Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. We term the resulting electronic state {\it the composite Bogoliubov Fermi liquid (CBFL)}. This phase has a number of remarkable properties that make it distinct from both the ACFL and the fully gapped Pfaffian. For instance, it is incompressible, has quantized Hall conductance, shows no quantum oscillations as a function of magnetic field or doping, and has topological ground state degeneracy on a torus despite the presence of gapless quasiparticles. At the same time, the neutral Bogoliubov Fermi surface yields metallic $T$-linear specific heat, non-quantized thermal conductance, Landau damping of density fluctuations, and a non-analytic $|\mathbf{q}|^3$ contribution to the equal-time structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$. We also briefly discuss vortex physics and possible fractionalized daughter states induced by doping or external magnetic fields. Our results pave the way for a broader understanding of gapless topological phases arising from paired composite fermions in Chern bands that go beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm.

### [3] [Comparison of SCAN+U and r2SCAN+U for Charge Density Wave Instability and Lattice Dynamics in CuTe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10146)
*Seungha Ju,Sooran Kim*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究确定了SCAN和r2SCAN泛函在描述铜碲材料中波色子 ordering中的表现,发现只有r2SCAN+U能够准确模拟实验中观察到的Te链偏移和声软模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释材料的本征物理性质和预测其性能需要合适的泛函和计算条件。

Method: 使用Meta-GGA泛函SCAN和r2SCAN，通过在CuTe材料中加入和不加入Hubbard U，分析Te-Te键变形、声子色散和电子结构以评估这两个泛函在捕捉波色子ordering中的表现。

Result: r2SCAN+U能准确模拟实验中的Te链偏移和声软模式，而SCAN表现出不合理的声子行为。

Conclusion: r2SCAN相较于SCAN更适合于描述波色子ordering和 lattice动态在CuTe中的形成。

Abstract: Identifying an appropriate exchange-correlation functional and computational conditions is essential for explaining the fundamental physics of materials and predicting their properties. Here, we investigate the performance of the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN, with and without a Hubbard U, for describing the charge density wave (CDW) in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe. By examining the Te-Te bond modulation, phonon dispersions, and electronic structures, we identify clear differences in how the two functionals capture the structural and dynamical properties of the CDW formation. r2SCAN+U reproduces the experimentally observed Te-chain distortions in the CDW phase and the phonon soft mode at qCDW=(0.4, 0.0, 0.5) in the non-CDW phase, whereas SCAN exhibits unphysical phonon behavior. The atomic displacements of the soft mode agree well with the experimental Te modulation. Despite their similar electronic structures and optimized lattice constants, our results demonstrate that r2SCAN is a more suitable choice than SCAN for describing CDW formation and lattice dynamics in CuTe.

Result: 沿(1,1,1)方向的电场不破坏Luttinger液态行为，其他方向的电场会导致系统形成双子层态；估算表明，(1,1,1)方向的电场对 Luttinger参数的调制能力在实际材料中具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 电场方向显著影响一维Kitaev模型的量子相变，为探索电场调控的量子相变和双子层态提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We perform a systematic study on the effects of electric fields in the Luttinger liquid phase of the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ $K_1J_1Γ_1Γ_1^\prime K_2J_2$ model in the region of ferromagnetic nearest-neighboring Kitaev coupling. We find that while electric fields along $(1,1,1)$-direction maintain the Luttinger liquid behavior, fields along other directions drive the system to a dimerized state. An estimation is made on how effective a $(1,1,1)$-field is for tuning the Luttinger parameter in real materials. Our work is useful for understanding the effects of electric fields in one-dimensional generalized Kitaev spin models, and provides a starting point for exploring the electric-field-related physics in two dimensions based on a quasi-one-dimensional approach.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity in Ce-based Kondo-lattice materials emerges almost exclusively in the vicinity of weak dipolar magnetic orders, while higher multipolar orders are only known to occur in a few Pr-based unconventional superconductors and possibly URu$_2$Si$_2$. The multiphase superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ appears to be a notable exception from this trend. Showing clear signatures of magnetism, this tetragonal system is suspected to host a concomitant quadrupolar order, which could be causing the strong enhancement of the ordering temperature when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the fourfold ($c$) axis of the lattice. In this work, we show that the field-temperature phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has a remarkable basal-plane anisotropy. This finding supports the scenario of coupled magnetic and multipolar ordering, which may have implications for the pairing mechanism of the superconductivity, and guides the development of the next iteration of theoretical models.

### [6] [Magnetic field-induced phases in a model S=1 Haldane chain system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10489)
*I. Jakovac,M. S. Grbić,M. Dupont,N. Laflorencie,S. Capponi,Y. Hosokoshi,S. Krämer,Y. Skourski,S. Luther M. Takigawa,M. Horvatić*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper investigates the field-induced phase transitions in an S=1 Haldane chain, specifically the zero-field Haldane phase, the benzene-based TLL phase, and the Bose-Einstein condensate phase at moderate to strong fields. The study uses combined theoretical framework and experiments including ^1H NMR to map the phase diagram, determine critical exponents, and confirm quantum-critical scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding field-induced phase transitions in Haldane chains is important for exploring the interplay between quantum fluctuations, magnetic interactions, and quantum critical phenomena. This study provides experimental validation of theoretical predictions.

Method: The researchers synthesize a constrained Haldane chain organic compound and use DFT calculations to model the phase diagram. They combine this with ^1H NMR spectroscopy to probe the TLL and BEC phases under various magnetic fields.

Result: The phase diagram reveals a complete sequence of phases: zero-field Haldane, field-induced TLL, and BEC. The critical exponent ν at the BEC transition is approximately 0.66, and the system exhibits universal quasiparticle scaling at the quantum critical point.

Conclusion: The study confirms the existence of the TLL and BEC phases in an S=1 Haldane chain and validates theoretical predictions about their properties and phase boundaries under magnetic fields. This is a significant experimental demonstration of field-induced quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional systems.

Abstract: An $S=1$ Haldane chain is a one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet where strong fluctuations result in quantum disordered singlet ground state with a gapped excitation spectrum. The gap magnitude is primarily set by the dominant intrachain interaction ($J_\text{1D}$). An applied magnetic field closes the gap at $B_\text{c1}$ and drives the system into a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) regime, followed by, at lower temperatures, a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) ground state, persisting up to $B_\text{c2} \propto 4 J_\text{1D}/gμ_B$. Almost all previously studied experimental realizations of such systems were based on transition-metal complexes which typically suffer from intrinsic anisotropies or large $J_\text{1D}$ values, limiting the access to the full theoretical phase diagram. We report a comprehensive study of TLL and BEC phases in the organic Haldane chain system 3,5-bis(N-tert-butylaminoxyl)-3'-nitrobiphenyl (BoNO). The absence of anisotropy and a moderate $J_\text{1D}$ enable exploration of the complete $B-T$ phase diagram. Through $^1$H nuclear magnetic resonance, combined with theoretical analysis, we characterize the TLL properties, map the BEC phase boundary $T_c (B)$, determine the associated critical exponent $ν\approx 0.66$ at $B_\text{c2}$, and demonstrate universal quasiparticle scaling in the quantum-critical regime. These results provide full experimental validation of theoretical predictions for field-induced phases in an $S=1$ Haldane chain, made over two decades ago.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Charge transfer is a common phenomenon in van der Waals heterostructures with proper work function mismatch, which enables electrostatic gating to control band alignment and interlayer charge distributions. This provides a tunable platform for studying coupled bilayer correlated electronic systems. Here, we theoretically investigate heterostructures of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) and an insulating substrate with gate-tunable band alignment. We first develop a self-consistent electrostatic theory for layer charge densities incorporating charge transfer, which reproduces the experimentally observed broadened and bent charge neutrality region. When the substrate's band edge has a much larger effective mass than RMG, its carriers can form a Wigner crystal at low densities. This creates a quantum superlattice that induces topological flat bands in the RMG layer, which may lead to Chern insulators driven by intralayer Coulomb interactions. Conversely, with comparable effective masses, we find an interlayer excitonic insulator state at charge neutrality stabilized by interlayer Coulomb coupling. Our work establishes these charge-transfer heterostructures as a rich platform for topological and excitonic correlated states, opening an avenue for ``charge-transferonics''.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The kagome lattice, a well known example of the geometrically frustrated system, hosts a dispersionless flat band that offers a unique platform for studying correlation-driven quantum phenomena. At appropriate particle concentrations, the existence of a flat band allows a representation of percolation with nontrivial weights. In this work, we investigate the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the repulsive SU($N$) Hubbard model on the kagome lattice within this percolation framework. In this representation, the model can be rigorously mapped to a classical $N$-state site-percolation problem on a triangular lattice, with the SU($N$) symmetry reflected in the nontrivial weights. By large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for SU($3$), SU($4$), and SU($10$) symmetries, we demonstrate that the critical particle concentration for ferromagnetism exceeds the standard percolation threshold and increases with $N$, indicating a strengthening of the effective entropic repulsion.

Abstract: We investigate the role of strong Coulomb interactions beyond the standard Hubbard model in two distinct physical contexts. First, we analyze the superconducting phase transition occurring near the Mott metal-insulator transition. Second, we study transport properties of artificial nano-scale structures containing quantum dots coupled to external electrodes. In both cases, we focus on the impact of the correlated (assisted) hopping (CH) interaction. For superconductors, CH acts as a driving mechanism for the phase transition and modifies the spectral properties of the system. We present the evolution of the spectral function as the system approaches the Mott-type transition under varying model parameters. In quantum-dot-based devices, CH influences the tunneling amplitude between the dot and metallic leads. We demonstrate that the characteristic changes in the conductance of a normal metal-quantum dot-normal metal structure provide a clear signature of the presence and sign of CH interaction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show a single Landau level (LL) dressed with periodic electrostatic potentials can realize a plethora of interacting topological phases where the Hall conductivity generally does not equal to the LL filling factor. Their physics can be captured by a minimal model of a delta potential lattice within a single LL, realizing exact zero energy Chern bands (denoted as decorated Landau levels or dLL) gapped from dispersive bands with rich geometric properties. With $p/q$ magnetic fluxes per unit cell, there are $q$ dispersive bands and $p-q$ zero energy bands forming the dLL. When the one-body potential strength dominates the electron-electron interaction, band mixing is suppressed and the dispersion bands consist of ``localized states" with vanishing total Chern number. Nevertheless these dispersive bands can have highly nontrivial Berry curvature distribution, and even non-zero Chern numbers when $q>1$. Interestingly even in the limit of large short range interaction, band mixing between dLL and dispersion bands can be strongly suppressed at low filling factor, leading to robust topological phases within the dLL stabilized by the one-body potential. The dLL and the associated dispersive bands can serve as minimal theoretical models for correlated physics in lattice or moire systems; they are also highly tunable experimental platforms for realizing rich phase diagrams of exotic 2D quantum fluids.

Abstract: Using the transport-of-intensity approach for free-space optical propagation in the paraxial regime, we show that diffraction is fundamentally related to the Fisher information associated with models of the transverse intensity distribution. By interpreting intensity as a probability density, we show that a) free-space diffraction will always act to flatten the intensity distribution as the beam propagates, and consequently b) diffraction will monotonically minimize the Fisher Information with respect to any parameterization of the intensity distribution model that depends on propagation distance.

Abstract: Partially coherent light is typically studied in the context of freely propagating continuous fields. Recent developments have indicated the existence of a `coherence advantage' in multimode optical communications, where partially coherent light outperforms coherent light. However, exploiting partial coherence in such applications requires manipulating multimode field coherence in programmable on-chip platforms. We present here the first example of on-chip synthesis and characterization of two-mode optical fields in an integrated on-chip hexagonal mesh of Mach-Zehnder interferometers. Starting with incoherent two-mode light, we adjust the degree of coherence on the chip with non-unitary transformations, construct $2\times2$ unitary transformations to synthesize prescribed coherence matrices, and reconstruct the coherence matrices via measurements of the spatial Stokes parameters. These results indicate the possibility of deploying programmable photonics for producing large-dimensional structured partially coherent light for applications in communications, cryptography, sensing, and spectroscopy.

Abstract: Recent research in nanophotonics for scintillation-based imaging has demonstrated promising improvements in scintillator performance. In parallel, advances in nanophotonics have enabled wavefront control through metasurfaces, a capability that has transformed fields such as microscopy by allowing tailored control of optical propagation. This naturally raises the following question, which we address in this perspective: can wavefront-control strategies be leveraged to improve scintillation-based imaging? To answer this question, we explore nanophotonic- and metasurface-enabled wavefront control in scintillators to mitigate image blurring arising from their intrinsically diffuse light emission. While depth-of-field extension in scintillation faces fundamental limitations absent in microscopy, this approach reveals promising avenues, including stacked scintillators, selective spatial-frequency enhancement, and X-ray energy-dependent imaging. These results clarify the key distinctions in adapting wavefront engineering to scintillation and its potential to enable tailored detection strategies.

### [14] [Variable coherence model for free-electron laser pulses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09885)
*Austin Bartunek,Nils H. Sommerfeld,Francois Mauger*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Variable coherence model (VCM) enables fine control over FEL pulse noise while maintaining average parameters. VCM allows for adjusting coherence width to vary sub-pulse statistics, generating pulses from maximally random to fully coherent. The model's flexibility is demonstrated through systematic statistical analyses and an absorption simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling the characteristics of free-electron laser (FEL) pulses is important for various applications, including precision metrology, imaging, and spectroscopy. The ability to adjust pulse noise characteristics while maintaining average parameters is crucial for optimizing these applications.

Method: The study builds on previous work by Pfeifer et al. (2010) and introduces a variable coherence width parameter, which enables fine-tuning of pulse characteristics. The method involves implementing the VCM, systematically analyzing sub-pulse statistics under different coherence widths, and applying the model in time and frequency domains. The method also includes statistical analyses across different FEL parameter regimes to demonstrate the model's flexibility.

Result: Results show that the VCM allows for continuous control of pulse characteristics. By adjusting the coherence width parameter, the model can generate pulses ranging from maximally random to fully coherent. Systematic analyses reveal how sub-pulse statistics are influenced by the coherence width. These findings demonstrate that VCM provides a versatile tool for controlling FEL pulses across various regimes.

Conclusion: The study provides a novel approach for controlling FEL pulse characteristics through the VCM, offering flexibility for different applications. This model extends previous work by enabling variable coherence control, which is likely to improve the predictability and reliability of FEL pulses in practical scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce the variable coherence model (VCM) for simulating free-electron laser (FEL) pulses generated through self-amplified spontaneous emission. Building on the established partial coherence model of [T. Pfeifer et. al, Opt. Lett. 35, 3441 (2010)], we demonstrate that the implementation of a variable coherence width allows for continuous control over the pulses' characteristic noise, while keeping the average pulse parameters such as the bandwidth fixed. We demonstrate this through systematic statistical analyses of the intensity and number of sub-pulses in VCM pulses, in both time and frequency. In particular, we analyze how the sub-pulse statistics are affected by the coherence width parameter. We perform our analyses across three distinct regimes of FEL parameters and demonstrate how the VCM can generate pulses that range from maximally random to fully coherent. Finally, we illustrate the effect of the VCM variable coherence width on an absorption simulation.

Abstract: Energy conservation imposes fundamental bounds on the polarizabilities of nanoparticles (NPs). While such bounds are well established for isotropic and bianisotropic NPs, they remain unexplored for magneto-optical NPs. Here, we derive the exact energy-conservation law governing the electric and magnetic dipolar response of axially symmetric magneto-optical NPs under general illumination conditions and arbitrary external magnetic fields. Two central results follow from energy conservation: (i) purely magneto-optical scattering, where the non-magnetic polarizability vanishes, is fundamentally forbidden, and (ii) strong magneto-optical scattering regimes, in which the magneto-optical polarizability dominates, are intriguingly allowed.

Abstract: Interfering deep ultraviolet (DUV) lasers can induce substantial density modulations in an ozone-doped gas flow via photochemical reactions, creating volume diffraction gratings. These transient optics are immune to target debris and shrapnel and feature orders-of-magnitude higher damage thresholds than conventional solid optics, providing a promising method for efficiently manipulating high-energy lasers. In this work, we describe gas gratings that can efficiently diffract probe beams across a variety of wavelengths and pulse durations, ranging from deep ultraviolet to near-infrared and from nanosecond to femtosecond, achieving a full beam diffraction efficiency up to 99% while preserving the focusability and wavefront quality. In addition, we present a comprehensive characterization of the performance of the gas gratings under various experimental conditions, including imprint fluence, gas composition, and grating geometries, showing significant enhancement of this process with the addition of carbon dioxide. We also demonstrate stable performance over hours of operation. Our results validate a previously developed theoretical model and suggest optimal parameters to efficiently scale gas gratings to high-energy applications.

Abstract: The accurate identification of historical restoration traces and material degradation is essential for the scientific preservation of ancient bronzes. In this study, the prestigious FUHAO bronze artifact (late Shang period, 13th-11th century BCE) was non-destructively examined using pulsed thermal imaging (PT). By combining single- and double-layer heat conduction models with Thermal Tomography (TT), this approach allowed for precise spatial localization of repair crevices, patches, and filler materials, while also distinguishing restorative interventions from the original bronze substrate. The artifact was revealed to have been assembled from multiple fragments, exhibiting uneven surface corrosion and clear evidence of prior conservation. The results not only provide direct insights for conservation strategy and historical interpretation but also demonstrate the capability of pulsed thermal imaging as an effective diagnostic tool for the integrated surface and subsurface assessment of cultural heritage objects.

Abstract: Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is motivated by the need for better understanding and control of particle manipulation at ENZ surfaces for applications in sensing and microfluidics.

Method: The study used photonic force microscopy to measure light-induced forces on dielectric particles near ENZ surfaces, varying the wavelength of visible light.

Result: The experimental results show that at the ENZ frequency, particles experience a repulsive force, which may be due to a combination of optical ENZ effects and thermophoretic forces.

Conclusion: This work provides a novel mechanism for contactless manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles using light-driven forces at ENZ interfaces, opening up possibilities for new applications in micro- and nanofluidics.

Abstract: Optical manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles near surfaces is fundamental for applications in sensing and microfluidics, yet controlling particle-surface interactions remains challenging. Here we experimentally investigate light-induced forces on dielectric particles near epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial surfaces using photonic force microscopy. By illuminating trapped particles with tunable visible light, we observe a wavelength-dependent repulsive force unique to ENZ surfaces, contrasting with the attractive forces near dielectric or metallic substrates. This repulsion peaks near the ENZ frequency and may be attributed to combined optical ENZ effects and thermophoretic forces. Our findings demonstrate that ENZ metamaterials can induce stable levitation of particles via light-driven forces, offering a novel mechanism for contactless manipulation in microfluidic environments. This work advances understanding of light-matter interactions at ENZ interfaces and suggests potential for ENZ-based optical control of micro- and nanoscale objects, with potential applications in micro- and nanofluidic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is crucial for biomedical imaging, but its data-intensive nature limits high-throughput applications. This paper aims to enhance efficiency through a neural network approach.

Method: An NN-based method was developed to generate LIV-based DOCT images from only four OCT volumes instead of 32.

Result: The NN model successfully produced LIV images with similar quality and quantitatively comparable to 32-volumes data. It reduced data size to 5.3 GB from 42 GB, transfer time to 55 seconds from 7 minutes, and processing time to 30 minutes from 4 hours.

Conclusion: This advancement enables faster and more efficient OCT imaging, opening possibilities for real-time applications.

Abstract: A neural-network (NN)-based method for high-speed, high-definition dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) using full-field swept-source optical coherence microscopy (FF-SS-OCM) is demonstrated. FF-SS-OCM provides high-definition OCT images, but, particularly in DOCT imaging, it results in a significant enlargement of the data size and subsequently long data streaming and processing time, which prevents high-throughput imaging. We address this issue by introducing an NN-based DOCT method that generates high-definition logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) -based DOCT images from only four OCT volumes, whereas the conventional method required 32 volumes. The NN model successfully generates an LIV image that is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the LIV image computed from 32 volumes. This approach significantly reduces data size, transfer time, and processing time for DOCT imaging by a factor of eight. Specifically, these were reduced from 42 GB to 5.3 GB, 7 min to 55 s, and 4 hours to 30 min, respectively.

Abstract: Spectrally engineered multifrequency nanolasers are highly desirable for on-chip photonics, multiplexed biosensing, and display technologies; yet, achieving them within a single compact platform remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate multimode lasing from symmetry-broken TiO2 metasurfaces integrated with an SU8 slab waveguide containing Rhodamine 6G. By co-engineering guided-mode resonances, surface lattice resonances near Rayleigh anomalies, and quasi-bound states in the continuum, we realize complementary high-Q feedback pathways that overlap with the gain spectrum. The direction of the lasing emission is tailored through outcoupling via second-order Bragg diffraction and Rayleigh anomaly conditions, supporting both normal and oblique emission. Experiments reveal discrete lasing outputs across ~100 nm bandwidth (548-648 nm), spanning nearly the full Rhodamine 6G emission band, with thresholds as low as ~7 nJ per pulse (35.7 uJ/cm^2) and up to four concurrent lasing peaks from a single device. These results establish a metasurface-dye platform for multifrequency and angle-selective lasing, opening new opportunities for compact, multifunctional nanophotonic sources.

Abstract: We establish a majorization-based theory for bounding observables of waves with varied coherence. For any measurement, exact bounds are attained by the maximal and minimal elements in the set of input coherence spectra. The set's supremum and infimum, which may lie outside the set, provide optimal universal bounds: any alternative spectrum yielding universal bounds produces weaker constraints. We present an algorithm to compute the supremum and infimum, and prove that they lie either at singular boundary points or strictly outside the set of coherence spectra.

Abstract: Weyl degeneracies in spectra of magnetoplasma waves enable nonreciprocal energy flow and topologically protected modes, yet conventional materials require impractical magnetic fields to operate. Developing an effective Hamiltonian framework for magnetic Weyl semimetals, we show that these systems overcome the limit, hosting Weyl magnetoplasma physics at zero field due to their giant intrinsic anomalous Hall response. The resulting topology supports nonreciprocal modes localized at magnetic domain walls, including a pair of topological "Fermi-arc-like modes and additional bound states. These effects are fully developed across a broad THz window, and we propose feasible experimental routes for their detection.

Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems host exotic transport regimes that are distinct from those found in periodic or disordered lattices. In this work, we study quantum transport in the Aubry-André-Harper lattice in a two-terminal setup coupled to zero-temperature reservoirs, where the conductance is evaluated via the nonequilibrium Green's function method. In the extended phase, we uncover a universal subdiffusive transport when the bath chemical potential aligns with the band edges. Specifically, the typical conductance displays a scaling of $\mathcal{G}_{\text{typ}}\sim L^{-2}$ with system size $L$. We attribute this behavior to the emergence of an exceptional point (Jordan normal form) in the transfer matrix in the thermodynamic limit. In the localized phase, the conductance shows exponential decay governed by the Lyapunov exponent. Intriguingly, in the critical phase, we identify pronounced log-periodic oscillations of the conductance as a function of system size, arising from the discrete scale invariance inherent to the singular-continuous spectrum. We further extend our analysis to the generalized Aubry-André-Harper model and provide numerical evidence suggesting that the exact mobility edge resides within a finite spectral gap. This results in a counter-intuitive exponential suppression of conductance precisely at the mobility edge. Our work highlights the distinct transport behaviors in quasiperiodic systems and elucidates how they are rigorously dictated by the underlying local spectral structure.

TL;DR: This paper investigates neutral free excitons in 2D electron-hole systems in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Two types of excitons are identified: heavy-hole excitons (HE) and light-excitons (X⁰). EL spectra reveal energy, lifetime, and spatial properties consistent with 2D behavior. The x⁰ exciton shows an energy level slightly above the bulk GaAs PL line, while its lifetime is significantly shorter than that of the bulk PL. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias and its properties are tunable via the topgate voltage. The x⁰ exciton's brightness and emission timing also depend on the topgate voltage, and the temperate dependence of the x⁰ peak energies supports a 2D character for these excitons. Time-resolved measurements suggest that the x⁰ exciton is primarily responsible for the temperature-dependent emission. This work bridges the understanding of 2D exciton physics with 2DEG and 2DHG platforms in undoped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, showing that these excitons can be electrically generated and controlled. Analyzer pulsed EL (tidal effect) confirms the controllable nature of X⁰ excitons and their relevance in 2D exciton physics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the generation and properties of neutral free excitons in undoped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures and to bridge 2D exciton physics with 2DEG/2DHG systems.

Method: The investigation combines photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, time-resolved measurements, and transfer electron microscopy (TEM) to analyze the EL spectra of the x⁰ and HE excitons. The authors also use the tidal effect to study the electrically generated X⁰ exciton.

Result: The paper identifies two types of excitons: the heavy-hole exciton (HE) and the light-exciton (X⁰). The X⁰ exciton shows a longer-tailed transient emission, consistent with being prompt and possibly of a 2D origin. The HE exciton shows Stark broadening and its emission properties are tunable by the topgate voltage. The x⁰ exciton's characteristics such as its temperature dependence of energy are consistent with a 2D-like origin. The experiments confirm the existence of these excitons and their controllable generation.

Conclusion: The paper conclusively demonstrates the existence and controllable generation of neutral free excitons, specifically X⁰ and HE, in undoped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. The results suggest that these excitons exhibit 2D-like behavior and provide a deeper understanding of 2D exciton physics, which is essential for 2DEG/2DHG platforms in undoped GaAs based devices. This work broadens the application of 2D exciton physics in optoelectronic systems.

Abstract: Bright electroluminescence (EL) from dopant-free ambipolar lateral p-n junctions in GaAs/AlGaAs single heterointerface (SH) heterostructures is used to probe neutral free excitons arising from two-dimensional electron and hole gases (2DEGs and 2DHGs). The EL spectra reveal both the heavy-hole neutral free exciton (X$^0$) and the high-energy free exciton of the H band (HE). A combination of transition energies, lifetimes, spatial emission profiles, and temperature dependences points to a predominantly two-dimensional character for these excitons at the SH. For X$^0$, the EL peak energies (1515.5-1515.7 meV) lie slightly above the corresponding bulk GaAs photoluminescence (PL) line at 1515.3 meV, while time-resolved measurements yield markedly shorter lifetimes for EL than for PL (337 ps vs. 1610 ps), consistent with recombination in a confined interfacial layer. The HE exciton exhibits a Stark blueshift under forward bias below threshold, and its energies and lifetimes (down to 575 ps) are tuned by the topgate voltage; above threshold, HE emission is quenched in favor of X$^0$. Finally, the tidal effect $-$ a form of pulsed EL generated by swapping the topgate voltage polarity in ambipolar field-effect transistors $-$ produces an X$^0$ line at the same energy as in the lateral p-n junction and reproduces the characteristic nonmonotonic frequency dependence of the brightness previously observed in quantum-well heterostructures, again indicating a 2D-like origin. Taken together, these results show electrically generated and controllable 2D-like excitons (HE and X$^0$), thereby bridging 2D exciton physics and 2DEG/2DHG platforms in dopant-free GaAs/AlGaAs SH devices.

Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.

Abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.

Abstract: Advances in the next generation of mesoscopic electronics require an understanding of topological phases in inhomogeneous media and the principles that govern them. Motivated by the nature of motifs available in printable conducting inks, we introduce and study quantum transport in a minimal model that describes a bundle of one-dimensional metallic wires that are randomly interconnected by semiconducting chains. Each of these interconnects is represented by a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, which can reside in either a trivial or a topological phase. Using a tight-binding approach, we show that such a system can transit from an insulating phase to a robust metallic phase as the interconnects undergo a transition from a trivial to a topological phase. In the latter, despite the random interconnectedness, the metal evades Anderson localization and exhibits a ballistic conductance that scales linearly with the number of wires. We show that this behavior originates from hopping renormalization in the wire network. The zero-energy modes of the topological interconnects act as effective random dimers, giving rise to an energy-dependent localization length that diverges as $\sim 1/E^2$. Our work establishes that random networks provide a yet-unexplored platform to host intriguing phases of topological quantum matter.

Motivation: The study of mechanical properties at the molecular scale in nanosheets, particularly in polymeric systems, has significant implications for nanomechanical devices and soft matter physics.

Method: Nanomechanical resonators were synthesized via transferring 2DPA-1 films onto etched chip surfaces with circular microwells. The molecules were analyzed under different gas conditions to understand their mechanical behavior.

Result: The resonators exhibited Eigenfrequencies consistent with tensioned plate theory when gas was absent, but shifted significantly with gas presence due to structural changes.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for scalable synthesis of synthetic polymer-based NEMS devices with unique material properties and structural tunability.

Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.

Abstract: The dynamic motion of topological defects in magnets induces an emergent electric field, as exemplified by the continuous flow of skyrmion vortices. However, the electrodynamics underlying this emergent field remains poorly understood. In this context, magnetic domain walls - one dimensional topological defects with two collective modes, sliding and spin tilt - offer a promising platform for exploration. Here, we demonstrate that the dissipative motion of domain walls under oscillatory current excitation generates an emergent electric field. We image domain patterns and quantify domain wall length under applied magnetic fields in mesoscopic devices based on the magnetic Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. These devices exhibit exceptionally strong domain wall scattering and a pronounced emergent electric field, observed in the imaginary component of the complex impedance. Spin dynamics simulations reveal that domain wall sliding dominates over spin tilting, where the phase delay of the domain wall motion with respect to the driving force impacts the emergent electric field. Our findings establish domain-wall dynamics as a platform for studying emergent electromagnetic fields and motivate further investigations on the coupled motion of magnetic solitons and conduction electrons.

Abstract: Extracting the complete quantum geometric and topological character of Bloch wavefunctions from experiments remains a challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we resolve this by introducing the "wavefunction form factor" (WFF) matrix, a quantity directly constructible from intensities in momentum- and energy-resolved spectroscopies like ARPES and INS. We demonstrate that band topology is encoded in "spectral nodes" -- momentum-space points where the WFF determinant vanishes, providing a direct readout of topological invariants via a topological selection rule. Furthermore, when the number of independent probes exceeds the number of the target bands, our framework yields an effective band projector. This enables the determination of Wilson loop spectra and the extraction of an effective quantum geometric tensor, providing a model-independent measurement of the non-Abelian Berry curvature and quantum metric as resolved by the experimental probes.

Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.

Abstract: Advances in fabrication techniques and high-performance electronics have facilitated the development of fine-pitch Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs). Earlier experimental and simulation findings suggest that these reduced-pitch GEMs can outperform the standard configuration in terms of effective gain, collection efficiency, and position resolution. However, a noticeable fraction of avalanche electrons is lost within the GEM systems, resulting in a degradation of charge collection efficiency. Therefore, a comprehensive simulation-based study is essential to provide deeper insights into the extent of degradation and its contributing factors. In this context, we employ ANSYS and Garfield++ to model the Triple GEM detectors with reduced pitch sizes of 90 and 60 $μ$m, and perform a comparative performance analysis with the standard configuration (pitch size: 140 $μ$m). At first, the simulation framework is validated by comparing the results of the standard configuration with available experimental data and previously reported simulation outcomes. Despite the characteristic gain offset, the framework remains physically consistent and reliable in capturing microscopic avalanche dynamics, reproducing the experimental trend. Following validation, we investigate electron losses at the metal electrodes and within the Kapton holes, electron transmission through the transfer and induction regions, electron diffusion on the induction electrode, and the overall collection efficiency. These parameters are analyzed as functions of GEM potential, outer hole diameter, inner hole diameter, Kapton thickness, metal thickness, and gas composition, thereby offering insights for designing efficient GEM detectors.

Abstract: In this paper we present a compact test facility for the measurement of optical properties of liquid argon as scintillation detector. The setup is under preparation at Roma Tre and it has a volume of 40 L liquid argon, which is liquefied from argon gas with a purity of $\ge 99.9999\%$ vol. To readout the scintillation photons from liquid argon with the highest intensity near 127 nm, we use the vacuum ultraviolet silicon photomultipliers from Hamamatsu. By submerging the photon detectors directly inside the liquid argon, we can eliminate the systematics from the wave length shifter and light guides which have been commonly used to detect the scintillation photons of liquid argon.

Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding radiative association is critical for space chemistry, especially for astrophysical studies involving ion-molecule reactions.

Method: A glow-discharge ion source, quadrupole mass filter, and ion trap were used to measure kinetics. The reaction of Ag⁺ and O₂ under pseudo-first-order conditions at room temperature provided the data points for the study.

Result: The study established the lower limit for the effective radiative-association rate coefficient, demonstrating the instrument's capability for diverse reactions.

Conclusion: This versatile instrument advances our ability to measure reaction rates for various ion-neutral interactions in space and laboratory settings.

Abstract: The ability to directly measure radiative-association rate coefficients for reactions between ions and neutral molecules has long challenged chemical physics laboratories, yet radiative association is one of the most important processes occurring in cold, diffuse regions of space. A reaction kinetics instrument has been developed for the investigation of ion--molecule radiative-association reactions, aimed at measuring slow, effective reaction rate coefficients for species relevant to astrophysical objects. The instrument consists of a glow-discharge ion source for production of bright and stable ion currents, a quadrupole mass filter for mass selection and detection, and a quadrupole ion trap capable of trapping reactants and products for the long times needed to measure slow kinetics. The performance and adaptability of the glow-discharge ion source has been evaluated using several configurations. To assess the feasibility of measuring reaction rate coefficients, the reaction of Ag$^{+}$ and O$_{2}$ was studied under pseudo-first-order conditions in the ion trap at room temperature. We present the first pressure-dependent study of this reaction and extract a lower limit of $1 \times 10^{-15}$ cm$^3$ molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ for the Ag$^{+}$ + O$_{2}$ effective radiative-association rate coefficient. Measurements of effective radiative-association rate coefficients are possible for diverse atomic and molecular ions that react with neutral molecules over a range of rates in this versatile new instrument.

TL;DR: A comprehensive model of water transport and impedance in PEM fuel cells across various conditions was developed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuel cell optimization through detailed water management is crucial for their efficiency and performance.

Method: The research involved developing an impedance model for water transport and integrating a two-phase cathode model to analyze current density and air flow effects.

Result: Findings reveal that carbon catalyst layer saturation decreases with higher current, influenced by water pressure, while higher relative humidity enhances double layer capacitance by increasing active surface area.

Conclusion: This model provides insights for optimizing PEM fuel cell operation by considering water-related impediments across different conditions and current densities.

Abstract: Effective water management is essential for the optimal performance of PEM fuel cells. We have developed an impedance model for liquid water transport through the membrane and coupled it with the two-phase model for cathode side impedance. The complete model was fitted to experimental spectra measured at anode/cathode relative humidities (RH) of 32/32\%, 50/50\% and 100/100\% within a current density range of 100 to 1000 mA cm$^{-2}$ and an air flow stoichiometry of 2. Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient. For all RH values, the CCL oxygen diffusivity increases dramatically with cell current due to progressive involvement of larger pores into the proton current conversion. Higher RH leads to higher double layer capacitance, which indicates that liquid water increases the electrochemically active surface area.

Conclusion: 量子类比方法在处理分布式电子体系和大分子系统的精确计算中展现出巨大的潜力，为未来量子化学的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Accurately capturing electron correlation in large-scale molecular systems remains one of the foremost challenges in quantum chemistry and a primary driver for the development of quantum algorithms. Classical configuration-interaction methods, while rigorous, suffer from exponential scaling, rendering them impractical for large or strongly correlated systems. Overcoming this limitation is central to realizing the promise of quantum computing in chemistry. Here, we investigate the pyridine-Li ion complex using three quantum algorithms: the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the subspace quantum diagonalization (SQD) method, and the recently introduced handover iterative VQE (HI-VQE). Our results demonstrate how new generations of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks overcome the scalability and noise sensitivity that constrain conventional VQE approaches. SQD and HI-VQE achieve ground-state energy calculations for problem sizes inaccessible to classical computation, marking a clear advance toward quantum advantage. In particular, HI-VQE enables calculations within active spaces as large as (24e,22o), requiring 44 qubits-well beyond the reach of classical CASCI and VQE. This capability provides a systematic pathway for incorporating increasing numbers of electrons into quantum treatment, thereby approaching exact molecular energies. Importantly, both SQD and HI-VQE exhibit robustness against hardware noise, a critical improvement over earlier approaches. By enabling quantum simulations of molecular systems previously deemed intractable, SQD and HI-VQE offer a realistic route toward practical quantum advantage in computational chemistry. The comparison between HI-VQE and SQD shows that optimizing circuit parameters is crucial for accurate simulation.

Result: 发现激发态内相干振动模式沿高频 C-C 振动模式快速衰减，而低频模式保持更长时间。此行为通过非adiabatic 电子态间振动能量重排机制合理解释。

Conclusion: 这些结果为理解 flavin 在光敏蛋白质中的功能以及设计光敏生物传感器提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Flavins are the chromophores in several blue-light-sensitive photoreceptor proteins and act as redox cofactors in many enzymes relevant for biological processes. Despite their biological relevance and numerous, detailed optical investigations of their photophysical properties, the ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics of their elementary optical excitations are not yet fully known. Here, we use ultrafast coherent vibrational spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution in the 450-nm spectral range to study their excited state coherent vibrational dynamics. We observe that coherent wavepacket motion along high-frequency C-C stretching modes with ~ 20-fs period is rapidly damped on a 20-fs timescale. In contrast, coherent motion along several low-frequency modes persists much longer. We attribute this to a mode-selective intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution driven by nonadiabatic couplings between the optical bright state and a close-lying dark electronic state, in accordance with model calculations. Our results may be of relevance for the formation of long-lived radical pair states in magnetic-field sensitive proteins.

Abstract: The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is a key quantity for describing and predicting intermolecular and ion-molecule interactions. Here, we assess the ability of machine-learning (ML) models to infer the MEP, based on the equivariant graph-convolutional neural network architecture PiNet2 and trained on dipole and quadrupole moments. For the established QM9 dataset, we find that including the quadrupole contribution in the ML models substantially improves their ability to recover the MEP compared to dipole-only models. This trend is confirmed on the SPICE dataset, which spans a much broader region of organic chemical space. Together, this study underscores the central role of the quadrupole moment as a fitting target for ML models aiming at rapid access to the MEP.

Abstract: We demonstrate for the specific case of $C_{3v}$ how the direct-product decomposition scheme for the treatment of symmetry in coupled-cluster (CC) calculations can be extended to non-Abelian point groups. We show that for the two-electron integrals and CC amplitudes a block structure can be obtained by resolving the reducible products of two irreducible representations into their irreducible representations. To deal with the necessary resorts of the ordering of the two-electron integrals and amplitudes, spin-adaptation, and the O(M$^5$) contractions (with M as the number of basis functions) of a CC calculation, we suggest a strategy that uses both the reduced and non-reduced representation of the corresponding quantities and switches back and forth between them. While the reduced representations are the ones used in the O(M$^6$) contractions, the other steps are better carried out in the non-reduced representation. Our pilot implementation of the CC singles and doubles method confirms in test calculations for NH$_3$ and PH$_3$ using different basis sets that significant savings (of more than 20 compared to treatments without symmetry and about 5 compared to treatments using $C_s$ symmetry) are possible and suggest that the exploitation of non-Abelian symmetry would render CC computations on large highly symmetric molecules possible

Abstract: We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.

Abstract: High-temperature technical superconductors are potential candidates for compact and high-field tokamak magnets. The demand for higher fusion power can be met with an on-axis high magnetic field due to toroidal magnets. An R&D activity has been initiated at the Institute for Plasma Research, India, to develop a compact D-shaped superconducting magnet utilizing REBCO high-temperature superconducting tapes. Under this initiative, a toroidal configuration with a major radius of 0.42 m, consisting of eight D-shaped, four poloidal field, and a central solenoid high-temperature superconducting magnets producing an on-axis toroidal magnetic field of 0.23 T has been conceptualized.

In this paper, we report the design of a compact D-shaped coil, the fabrication of a long length HTS cable, a winding pack, and its integration with a cryogenic casing and vacuum enclosure. The winding pack terminations, joints, its interfacing with the power supply, and performance testing are also reported in this paper.

TL;DR: The paper describes a method using muon beams to detect precursor signals for earthquakes by measuring tectonic stress changes along active faults. This method, named ERMES, distinguishes itself by detecting signals within quartz crystals rather than in open space, potentially enabling early warnings for earthquakes. The muon beam's penetration capability is modeled to be about 3 km for a 10 TeV beam, with Geant4 simulations revalidated to understand secondary muon contributions. The approach offers a new way to monitor tectonic stress for early earthquake prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop an early warning system for earthquakes through precise monitoring of tectonic stress changes using advanced muon beam technology, which could significantly improve civil protection systems and public safety.

Method: The method involves using high-energy muon beams to interrogate quartz-rich granite rocks surrounding active faults. This allows the detection of piezoelectrically generated electromagnetic signals within the rocks, distinct from signals measured in open space. A newly designed muonic lens manipulates the beam's properties after it traverses the rock, and simulations are used to predict the beam's effectiveness in detecting these signals and to assess secondary particle production effects.

Result: The study proposes a system that can detect precursor signals up to 3 km deep in rock, particularly for high-energy muon beams. Simulations using Geant4 validate the effectiveness of the muon beam management in detecting precursor signals and provide insights into secondary particle interactions, which could be crucial for system optimization.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel technique for earthquake prediction using muon beams, demonstrating potential for real-world application. By detecting stress changes early, the method could contribute to more effective early warning systems, enhancing disaster prevention and mitigation efforts potentially saving lives and property.

Abstract: In this paper we extend a previous analysis of a newly conceived technique based on active interrogation of tectonic stress evolution in regions hosting active seismogenic faults. The aim is to monitor and detect stable and reliable precursor signals on an adequate time scale, well before an earthquake event, that can play a crucial role in activating alarms for civil protection systems. The precursor signal relies on continuous measurements of the time evolution of tectonic stress, obtained by interrogating underground, with a high energy collimated muon beam, the piezoelectric fabrics present in quartz rich granite like rocks surrounding a known seismogenic fault in the Earth crust. Beam propagation through the rock across the active fault conveys to a detector at the exit of the traversal information on the amplitude of the piezoelectric field, which scales with the tectonic stress applied to quartz crystals embedded in the rock. The system, named ERMES (Earthquake Reconnaissance using Muon beam Evolution in Silicon dioxide), differs from other techniques under study detecting electromagnetic signals generated by piezoelectricity outside the Earth crust, as it probes piezoelectric effects directly inside the source region of the associated electromagnetic field, namely the near field within quartz crystals rather than the far field in open space. We present a focused analysis of muon beam manipulation after rock traversal and before detection using a newly conceived muonic lens, and we explore the maximum rock penetration capability of a high energy muon beam, reaching about 3 km of rock thickness for a 10 TeV beam. Owing to the peculiarity of muon propagation through such kilometer scale targets, we cross checked previous FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to clarify the secondary muons role generated by primary muon interactions in solid matter over long propagation lengths.

TL;DR: The paper discusses how slit-profiler methods in photo injectors can introduce systematic errors in measuring transverse emittance, including effects from slit size, beamlet imaging, and space charge, and proposes corrections using simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate measurement of transverse emittance is crucial for evaluating beam quality in photo injectors, which directly impacts the performance of the facility.

Method: The paper uses slit-profiler methods, which involve scanning a slit across the beam and measuring divergence with a downstream profiler.

Result: Systematic errors from slit size, beamlet imaging, and space charge can significantly affect emittance measurements, especially in strongly coupled 2D phase spaces.

Conclusion: The paper presents correction methods for these systematic errors, validated through simulations and experiments at the PITZ facility.

Abstract: In photo injectors, the transverse emittance is one of the key measures of beam quality as it defines the possible performance of the whole facility. As such it is important to measure the emittance in photo injectors and ensure the accuracy of these measurements. While there are many different methods of measuring the emittance, this paper focuses on quantifying the systematic errors present in transverse phase space measurements taken with slit-profiler methods, i.e. scanning a narrow slit over the beam and continually measuring the passed beamlets' divergence with a downstream profiler. The measurement errors include effects of the slit size, beamlet imaging, and residual space charge. While these effects are generally small, they can have significant impact on the measured emittance when the 2D phase space is strongly coupled. The systematic effects studied and corrections are demonstrated with simulations and measurements from the Photo Injector Test facility at DESY in Zeuthen (PITZ) using a slit-screen emittance scanner.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the effects of key electrical parameters on the dynamics of a plasma opening switch in a small-sized electron accelerator and proposes a method for determining voltage multiplication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research addresses the challenge of achieving high voltage multiplication factors in compact electron accelerators by improving the plasma opening switch's dynamics.

Method: An experimental method was developed using current oscillograms to assess voltage changes, verified with minimal error by a capacitive voltage divider.

Result: Successful determination of current and voltage dynamics during posit opening, reduction of diagnostic tools in the chamber.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for optimizing accelerator operation and enhancing voltage multiplication through improved diagnostics.

Abstract: To increase the voltage multiplication factor in a small-sized direct-acting electron accelerator DIN-2K with an inductive energy storage and a plasma opening switch, it is necessary to ensure an increase in the rate of change of the current and its amplitude during the POS opening for the purpose of obtaining an explosive electron emission with the formation of an electron beam and a virtual cathode. However, the opening process depends on many electrical parameters of the plant, and it re-quires determining their joint and individual effect on its dynamics. The purpose of this research is to study and determine the effects of electrical parameters, including those of the discharge voltages of the entire electrical circuit of the accelerator on the dynamics of the plasma opening switch, in particular opening speed, current amplitudes, and opening time, as well as to give recommendations on optimizing the operation of accelerators of this type and highlight possible ways to increase the voltage multiplication factor. Methodology. A method for determining the induced voltage according to experimental current oscillograms has been proposed. The methodology was verified by the coincidence of its data with the results of measurements by a capacitive voltage divider with the data spread of less than 20%. Scientific novelty. The rates of change in the current at the plasma switch opening stage were determined depending on the main electrical parameters of the DIN-2K accelerator. The diagnostics of the voltage induced during the POS opening were provided using no capacitive voltage divider in the internal volume of the accelerator, which enabled the removal of some diagnostic tools from the working volume of the chamber. Practical significance.

Abstract: We study stem-terminally differentiated (TD) lineages in small niches where demographic noise from discrete division and death events is non-negligible. Starting from a mechanistic five-channel, density-dependent CTMC (symmetric self-renewal, symmetric differentiation, asymmetric division, dedifferentiation, TD death), we derive its mean-field limit and a functional CLT, obtaining a chemical Langevin diffusion whose explicit state-dependent covariance exactly matches the CTMC's aggregated channel-wise infinitesimal covariances. Within this diffusion approximation we remove the dedifferentiation flux and obtain a sharp dichotomy: in subcritical regimes the stem coordinate becomes extinct asymptotically almost surely, whereas in supercritical regimes polynomial moments diverge exponentially. This identifies, at the diffusion level, a structural failure mode of strictly hierarchical lineages under demographic fluctuations and clarifies how a cyclic return flux can rescue homeostasis. For interpretation we also derive an exact totals ODE backbone from a damage-structured transport model and obtain two steady-state constraints (ratio and equalization laws) linking compartment ratios to turnover and balancing dedifferentiation against fate bias. Numerical experiments corroborate the $Ω^{-1/2}$ fluctuation scaling, illustrate the pathology, and contrast theorem-regime global convergence with threshold (Allee-type) behaviour outside the theorem hypotheses.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding collective behavior in active systems with environmental modulation is important in various fields, from biology to robotics.

Method: The study uses a persistent random walk model combined with chemotaxis, analyzing system phases under chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise.

Result: The model shows distinct phases of collective behavior ranging from disordered to polar waves and nematic clusters, driven by resource dynamics.

Conclusion: This work bridges active matter physics and movement ecology, showing how complex patterns can emerge from resource dynamics alone, potentially useful for designing autonomous systems.

Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.

Abstract: Mo-Si multilayer mirrors are central to extreme ultraviolet lithography, where nanoscale optical interference and heat accumulation together constrain reflectivity and operational stability. Here we develop an analytical electromagnetic-thermal coupling model that directly links transfer-matrix-based interference-controlled energy deposition with transient heat conduction in EUV-irradiated multilayers. The model reveals a fundamental trade-off whereby increasing the multilayer period number enhances reflectivity but simultaneously elevates temperature by impeding heat dissipation. Interference-driven volumetric absorption further gives rise to pronounced axial temperature gradients and a post-pulse downward migration of the heat-flux maximum, a delayed-heating effect inaccessible to conventional surface-flux-based models. Systematic analysis establishes scaling laws connecting interfacial thermal resistance, beam size, and incident energy density to thermal confinement and temperature rise. By incorporating interfacial compaction kinetics, the model enables a quantitative assessment of mirror lifetime. This work offers a theoretical tool for thermal-optical co-design of multilayer nanostructures including EUV mirrors under pulsed irradiation across a wide spectral range.

TL;DR: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) improves parameter estimation speed in gravitational wave astronomy but can be computationally expensive for longer signals. This paper proposes a modified construction strategy using a PyROQ-based method that utilizes multiband waveforms to speed up the basis search process without sacrificing likelihood speed or accuracy. The new method constructs ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalV3 waveform, achieving a 20% to 30% reduction in basis size and a 10-fold decrease in construction time.

Abstract: Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to speed up parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, the construction of ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood speed and accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass range using the \texttt{IMRPhenomXAS\_NRTidalV3} waveform. We find a 20\% to 30\% decrease in basis size and a $\sim 10$ times decrease in basis construction time. We verify the altered method preserves the likelihood accuracy and mantains consitent parameter estimation results.

Abstract: In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.

Abstract: We studied the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (KBR) spacetime, an exact rotating electrovacuum solution describing a black hole (BH) immersed in an intrinsic, uniform electromagnetic field. We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.

Abstract: We explore the cosmological dynamics of a teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet gravity model defined by the torsion scalar $T$ and the torsion-based Gauss-Bonnet invariant $T_{\mathcal{G}}$, deriving modified Friedmann equations for a flat FLRW Universe and corresponding linear scalar perturbation equations. Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $Λ$CDM paradigm. Stability is confirmed via scalar perturbation analysis of Hubble and matter density fluctuations, positioning $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity as a robust framework to address cosmic acceleration challenges. The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $ω_{\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \approx -0.664$ to \(-0.693\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\kms. These findings highlight the potential of $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity to resolve fundamental cosmological puzzles while aligning with late-time observational data.

Abstract: Waves propagating through a gravitational potential exhibit wave-optics effects when their wavelength is not significantly smaller than the lensing scales. We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $α$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.

Abstract: The definition of weak equivalence principle of quantum matter is an open problem at present. In order to reflect the probability of quantum system in the quantum version of weak equivalence principle, we proposed a quantum weak equivalence principle based on differential scattering cross section at tree level, that is, the differential scattering cross section does not depend on the mass and properties of the scattered particles when the target particles take the large mass limit. This version of the quantum equivalence principle we proposed will be broken by the spin properties of quantum matter. In the non-relativistic case, the difference of differential scattering cross sections of scattered particles with different spin properties scattered by target particles is mainly reflected in the order of $ \mathcal O (p _ {\mathrm{cm}} ^2) $. In the relativistic case , we studied the asymptotic behavior of differential scattering cross sections at small angles. When the target particles are scalar particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/θ^2) $ order. When the target particles are Dirac particles, the difference of light particles with different spin properties is mainly reflected in the $ \mathcal O (1/θ^4) $ order. The polarization of differential scattering cross section when scattered particles are Dirac particles is investigated. The result of the degree of polarization depends on the polarization direction of the incident particles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational-wave detection, particularly distinguishing backgrounds, is crucial for astrophysical insights. Current methods rely on averaged detector responses, which introduce biases. This paper aims to address these biases.

Method: The authors revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. They find that to improve parameter estimation accuracy, second-order corrections should be considered alongside an approach that accounts for the source distribution's sky integration, while avoiding excessive computational demands.

Result: Simulations and analyses show that the proposed method effectively reduces parameter estimation biases, even when applied to anisotropic backgrounds, and remains computationally tractable.

Conclusion: This advancement allows for more accurate modeling of gravitational-wave backgrounds, enhancing the detection and characterization of astrophysical events like binary black hole mergers.

Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections, particularly from binary black hole mergers, there is increasing anticipation that an astrophysical background, formed by an ensemble of faint, high-redshift events, will be observed in the near future by the ground-based detector network. This background is anticipated to exhibit non-Gaussian statistical properties. To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. In this work, we demonstrate that properly accounting for the detector antenna pattern is essential. Current approaches typically rely on the overlap reduction function averaged over the sky. Through simulations, we show that using such an averaged response introduces significant biases in parameter estimation. In addition, we propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections as an approximation of the full integral over the source distribution. Our results indicate that this approach effectively eliminates these biases. We also show that our method remains robust even when considering anisotropic backgrounds.

Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.

Abstract: We show how our Universe can emerge from a symmetry breaking of a multicomponent $W_3$ algebra, where the components in addition form a Jordan algebra. We discuss how symmetry breaking related to the Jordan algebras $H_3(C)$ and $H_3(O)$ over the complex and octonion numbers can lead to an extended four-dimensional spacetime, where the expansion of the Universe is governed by a modified Friedmann equation. We finally discuss how this modified Friedmann equation might explain a number of puzzling cosmological observations.

Abstract: The remnants of binary neutron star mergers are expected to be massive, rapidly rotating stars whose oscillations produce gravitational waves in the kilohertz band. The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.

TL;DR: 研究发现，带有净磁电荷的旋转黑洞对带电标量场表现出显著增强的超辐射不稳定性，比中性库普卡黑洞高几个数量级。这种增强源于磁单极子导致的离心势垒减小。这种效应深化了引力束缚态势垒，导致不稳定性增强速率显著提高，形成一个可以产生强双色连续引力波（GW）的宏观玻色云。研究表明，这种引力波强度高于库普卡黑洞情况。磁单极谐振选择规则限制了波源的辐射方向。两者叠加产生近圆偏振的连续引力波，具有固定的位置在偶极子引力理论中。这些发现为磁单极子和超轻子的探测提出潜在的目标策略。不同于库普卡黑洞的情况，磁单极残留物在几周内通过地基和空间引力波探测器探测到强双色连续引力波信号，并且在mHz频段。以磁单极大质量残留物为例，双黑洞合并后的快速 follow-up引力波信号在几周内就能探测到。未来极化测量（如椭圆度）可以区分磁单极子情况与库普卡情况，同时为偶极子引力理论中圆偏振的引力波提供一种机制。

Abstract: We present an analytic framework demonstrating that a spinning black hole endowed with a net magnetic charge exhibits a dramatically amplified superradiant instability against charged scalar fields, enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the neutral Kerr case. The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.

Motivation: 暗能量对宇宙加速膨胀的影响是一个重要的天体物理问题，研究$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity模型如何解释这一现象。

Method: 研究采用了扩展$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity模型，结合 barotropic 液体的 Friedmann 方程，通过 Markov 链蒙特卡罗方法进行参数约束。

Result: 通过 DESI DR2 BAO 数据、P-BAO 数据及 cosmic chronometer 数据，研究得出：$H_0 	hat{69.5}	ext{ km s}^{-1}	ext{ Mpc}^{-1}$，$q_0 	hat{-0.57}$，转换红移$z_{	ext{tr}} 	hat{0.56-0.77}$，以及有效物质量参数的平滑演化暗示宇宙从早期减速到后期加速。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity模型为GRAlternative的宇宙学提供了一个有效的替代，尤其在解释暗能量驱动的加速膨胀方面表现出色。

Abstract: We investigate late-time cosmology in the context of modified $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, considering a non-linear model$ f(Q,L_m) = αQ + βL_m^n + λ$ where, $α$, $β$, $λ$, and $n$ are some free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a barotropic cosmic fluid, and an analytical solution for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is obtained. Using the latest DESI DR2 BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets, we constrain the model parameters through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. Our results show that the model successfully describes the observed late-time cosmic acceleration with slightly tighter constraints from the inclusion of DESI dataset. The present-day Hubble constant is determined as $H_0 \simeq 69.5\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, while the deceleration parameter confirms accelerated expansion with $q_0 \simeq -0.57$. The transition redshift, where the universe switches from deceleration to acceleration, occurs in the range $z_{\rm tr} \sim 0.56 - 0.77$. Similarly, a smooth and physically consistent transition from a matter-dominated decelerated period at high redshifts to an accelerated phase at late times is revealed by the evolution of $ω_{eff}(z)$. While statefinder diagnostic shows the model favours a Chaplygin gas like nature for DESI and DESI+CC, whereas the model favours as quintessence dominated evolution for P-BAO+CC in the late time regime. Conclusively, all these results along with the study of the energy conditions and stability analysis showcases the given $f(Q,L_m)$ model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了拓扑算子在 bulk 中的行为，揭示了 bulk 和边界理论的独特性质。

Abstract: Topological field theories (TFTs) play an important role in characterizing the deep infrared (IR) of many quantum systems with a mass gap, as well as the global symmetries of quantum field theories (QFTs) decoupled from gravity. In gravitational asymptotically AdS spacetimes, TFT sectors which are putatively decoupled from local metric data are nevertheless non-perturbatively sensitive to Newton's constant via a sum over topologically distinct saddle point configurations. Tracking the fate of this non-decoupling in the boundary dual, we argue that in spite of appearances, this dependence on Newton's constant extends to local metric fluctuations. Said differently, TFTs are in the Swampland. In tandem with earlier results on the absence of global symmetries in theories with subregion-subregion duality, this also establishes that topological operators of boundary systems with a gravity dual are always non-topological in the bulk.

### [66] [Superball of Strings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09785)
*Yoav Zigdon*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper explores the low-energy limit of string theory and presents a solution of the supergravity equations corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. This solution involves a 'Superball of Strings' which is a static, spherically symmetric 'fuzzball' of BPS strings with a size set by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory in a significant part of parameter space. While the solution does not constitute a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, there are noted connections. The paper discusses a singular extremal black hole and the 'Superball of Strings,' both existing as Supergravity solutions with the same asymptotic boundary conditions, but argues that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper 'Superballs of Strings' aims to solve the equations of the low-energy limit of string theories to obtain a specific solution involving a 'Superball of Strings.' The author introduces this concept after a brief overview of superstring theory and its implications. The paper seems to investigate this concept in the framework of supergravity to make connections with existing works for further understanding.

Method: The author describes solving the equations of the low-energy limit of string theory and discusses a 'Superball of Strings' which is a static, spherically symmetric 'fuzzball' of BPS strings. The size of this solution is set by a random walk scaling. This approach is based on previous works of Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, particularly regarding a Euclidean, horizonless solution, and draws connections to the 'fuzzball' proposal. The author also presents a singular extremal black hole and the 'Superball of Strings' as Supergravity solutions with same boundary conditions, arguing that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.

Result: The paper introduces a new solution, the 'Superball of Strings,' which is a static, spherically symmetric configuration of BPS strings. This solution is obtainable by solving the low-energy limit of string theory’s equations and can be embedded into string theory within a significant part of parameter space. It is noted that this solution resembles a 'fuzzball' but does not correspond to a Lorentzian interpretation of a Euclidean, horizonless solution. Additionally, the paper points out connections between the 'Superball of Strings' and a singular extremal black hole in Supergravity, arguing that the 'Superball of Strings' represents generic BPS microstates with specific asymptotic boundary conditions.

Conclusion: Despite its complexity and the limited understanding of the central mechanism of this 'Superball of Strings,' the author’s work presents a compelling argument for the existence of a static, spherically symmetric configuration of BPS strings as a viable solution to the low-energy limit of string theory. The paper effectively draws connections between different string theory concepts and Supergravity solutions, contributing valuable insights into microstates and black hole entropy.

Abstract: I solve the equations of the low-energy limit of string theory to obtain a solution corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. This ``Superball of Strings'' is a static, spherically symmetric ``fuzzball'' of BPS strings with a size set by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory in a significant part of parameter space. While the solution does not constitute a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, a few connections are noted. A singular extremal black hole and the Superball of Strings exist as Supergravity solutions with the same asymptotic boundary conditions; however, I argue that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.

Abstract: First-order phase transitions occur through the nucleation of critical bubbles of the stable phase within the metastable phase. Using holography, we present a fully microscopic description of these bubbles in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory at finite temperature. In the gravitational dual, these bubbles correspond to static, inhomogeneous and unstable black-brane solutions with a localized deformation on the horizon. We construct these solutions across the entire metastable branch and compute the surface tension and the nucleation rate. We then compare these microscopic results with those obtained from a two-derivative effective action for the order parameter in two different scenarios. When the effective action is derived from the microscopic theory via holography, we find remarkable agreement. However, when the effective action is constrained only by the equation of state and dimensional analysis, significant discrepancies emerge. These discrepancies can be resolved if an additional constraint related to the surface tension is imposed.

Abstract: We investigate how a thermodynamical first-order phase transition affects the dynamical chaotic behaviour of a given model. To this effect, we analyze the model of Berkooz, Brukner, Jia and Mamroud that interpolates between the double-scaled SYK model and an integrable chord Hamiltonian. This model displays a first-order phase transition given by a kink in the free energy. We map out the dynamical behaviour, as characterized by chord number, Krylov complexity, and operator size, of the model across the phase diagram. We observe a jump in the chord numbers at the transition point, in agreement with the first-order transition. We further determine how scrambling measures, i.e.~the growth of the Lanczos coefficients and the time dependence of the operator size, change across the phase diagram. Deep inside the two phases, these measures indeed display integrable and chaotic behaviour, respectively. Across the transition however, we observe no qualitative change in these measures. This means that the thermodynamical transition does not imply a sharp transition in the growth exponent characterizing the dynamical chaotic behaviour. We also discuss a possible holographic interpretation of the model.

Abstract: The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double-copy construction reveals a fundamental structural connection between gauge and gravity theories. At its core, the BCJ double copy is directly due to a duality between the algebraic relations of a color root and those of a kinematic root. We generalize this principle beyond the conventional Lie algebra structure of tree-level Yang-Mills theory. By demanding color-kinematics duality for the complete basis of four-point color structures -- including those involving the symmetric $d^{abc}$ constants -- we define the universal double copy. We systematically classify the bases of all such parity-even generalized gauge-theory numerators and, independently, the space of all parity-even four-graviton higher-derivative operators. We demonstrate that our universal double-copy construction precisely spans the entire tower of parity-even four-graviton amplitudes in any dimension, except for the Lovelock $R^3$ contribution in $D >6$ which we can express in terms of a particularly simple universal triple-copy involving gauge theories coupled to scalars. Explicit machine-readable expressions for the complete basis of gauge-theory numerators and fundamental gravitational building blocks are provided in the ancillary files. This establishes that all possible four-point gravitational interactions can be factorized into products of gauge-theory building blocks governed by this universal notion of color-kinematics duality.

Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral was recently used to argue that standard Euclidean axion wormholes do not dominate computations of connected AdS/CFT partition functions. We now apply similar methods to study the seemingly-analogous Jackiw-Teitelboim wormholes constructed by Garcia-Garcia and Godet using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with an imaginary-valued minimally-coupled massless scalar field. However, this time we find that these wormholes do dominate our path integral for the relevant connected partition function. This supports the suggestion by Garcia-Garcia and Godet that contributions from such wormholes parallel the physics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at complex couplings. The result also illustrates the sensitivity of wormhole contributions to details of the relevant physics.

Abstract: Boundary integrability provides rare analytic control over field theories in the presence of an interface, from quantum impurity problems to open string dynamics. We develop an analytic framework for integrable boundaries in two-dimensional sigma-models that determines admissible reflection maps directly from the meromorphic Lax connection. Applying it to open strings on $AdS_3\times S^3$ with mixed NSNS and RR flux, we find two branches of integrable boundary conditions. One branch admits D-branes wrapping twisted conjugacy classes on $SU(1,1)\times SU(2)$, with the mixed-flux deformation encoded entirely into dynamical boundary data. At the exactly solvable WZW point these coincide with the conformal D-branes, providing a natural link to conformal perturbation theory.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A holographic entropy inequality (HEI) is a linear inequality obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi holographic entanglement entropies, or equivalently by the minimum cut function on weighted graphs. We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.

Abstract: Quantities computed by minimal cuts, such as entanglement entropies achievable by the Ryu-Takayanagi proposal in the AdS/CFT correspondence, are constrained by linear inequalities. We prove a previously conjectured property of all such constraints: Any $k$ systems on the "greater-than" side of the inequality are subsumed in some $k$ systems on its "less-than" side (accounting for multiplicity). This finding adds evidence that the same inequalities also constrain the entropies under time-dependent conditions because it preempts a large class of potential counterexamples. We prove several other properties of holographic entropy inequalities and comment on their relation to quantum erasure correction and the Renormalization Group.

Abstract: We consider the question of counting the degrees of freedom in theoretical models, with an emphasis on theories of fields and gravity. Among the possible approaches, the Hamiltonian formulation remains one of the most systematic and robust tools. However, it can easily become long and technically involved. In this work, we present a broadly applicable recipe to find the degrees of freedom directly, based on the Lagrangian formulation. We compare it to the standard approaches, highlight the challenges that may arise in the latter, and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to transparent insights about the dynamical nature of theory in a quick, simple, and straight-forward way.

Conclusion: 该研究在 shellworld 模型中找到了稳定的无奇点宇宙学行为，为 bulk- boundary 对应关系的应用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In the braneworld scenario, we introduce a uniformly distributed cloud of infinitely long strings in the five dimensional AdS bulk spacetime. The end points of the strings are attached to the brane and becomes the source of the four dimensional matter on the brane, while the body of the strings hang onto the radial direction of the bulk and act as the gluonic field on the brane. The presence of matter in the brane induces a nonsingular cosmological evolution for the scale factor of the brane world under certain conditions of mass and cosmological parameters. However, the nonsingular nature is unstable since the bounce occurs inside the Cauchy horizon. Further, we consider the shellworld or the dark bubble scenario for the same bulk spacetime. It shows stable nonsingular cosmological nature of the bubble universe under certain conditions on the bulk and bubble parameters.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the eigenfunctions of twisted Cherednik operators and their properties under different limits, highlighting the complexity and solvability of the equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of such operators is important for understanding algebraic structures and their applications in related fields.

Method: The authors analyze eigenfunctions by examining limits as q approaches 1 and considering symmetric and non-symmetric polynomial eigenfunctions.

Result: They find that the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set under certain conditions, which is useful for further analysis and solving related problems.

Conclusion: Understanding these eigenfunctions can provide insights into symmetric and non-symmetric polynomial solutions for Cherednik operators, potentially applicable to various mathematical problems.

Abstract: The common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators can be first analyzed in the limit of $q\longrightarrow 1$. Then, the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set originating from the symmetric ground state of non-vanishing degree and excitations over it, described by non-symmetric polynomials of higher degrees and enumerated by weak compositions. This pattern is inherited by the full spectrum at $q\neq 1$, which can be considered as a deformation. The whole story looks like a typical NP problem: the Cherednik equations are difficult to solve, but easy to check the solution once it is somehow found.

*D. G. C. McKeon,F. T. Brandt,J. Frenkel,S. Martins-Filho*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper examines the first-order Einstein-Cartan (EC) action in 2+1 dimensions, including a cosmological term and its supersymmetric extension. The spin connection is expressed as an axial vector, allowing the action to be bilinear in the quantum fields and enabling quantization without background fields. The paper identifies the complete set of first-class constraints and derives the associated gauge transformations, which differ from the standard diffeomorphism and local Lorentz invariances. Using the closed gauge algebra, the paper constructs the Faddeev-Popov-Nielsen path integral and shows how a Lagrange multiplier field can be introduced to remove higher-loop contributions while preserving unitarity and gauge invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper presents a detailed analysis of the first-order Einstein-Cartan (EC) action in a specific spacetime dimension and includes advanced topics such as supersymmetry, spin connections, and gauge transformations. This indicates a motivation to explore foundational aspects of gravitational theories and quantum field theory in lower dimensions, which could have implications for understanding quantum gravity and related phenomena.

Method: The authors use a systematic approach, starting with the construction of the EC action in 2+1 dimensions. They incorporate a supersymmetric extension and analyze the spin connection in terms of an axial vector. The method involves identifying constraints, deriving gauge transformations, and constructing the path integral using the Faddeev-Popov-Nielsen procedure. The introduction of a Lagrange multiplier field is also a key methodological step.

Result: The main results of the paper include a thorough identification of the first-class constraints in the EC action framework, the derivation of associated gauge transformations, and the successful construction of the path integral. Additionally, the paper demonstrates how to introduce a Lagrange multiplier field to eliminate higher-loop contributions, ensuring unitarity and gauge invariance while maintaining the quantum consistency of the theory.

Conclusion: The paper provides a comprehensive and rigorous analysis of the first-order EC action in 2+1 dimensions, incorporating supersymmetry and the removal of higher-loop contributions. The results contribute to our understanding of gravitational theories in lower dimensions and the quantization of such systems while preserving unitarity and gauge invariance.

Abstract: We examine the first-order Einstein-Cartan (EC) action in 2+1 dimensions, including a cosmological term and its supersymmetric extension.

Abstract: Soft current algebras capture the infrared structure of scattering in asymptotically flat spacetimes, but an analogous algebraic description of finite-energy dynamics has been missing. We uncover an infinite-dimensional hard current algebra that encodes finite-energy contributions to scattering and implies novel Ward identities. The soft current algebras are not independent but arise naturally from the hard ones. This provides a unified algebraic framework underlying quantum theory in flat spacetime.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We analyze a static open string in a general stationary spacetime, which can represent a heavy quark-antiquark pair within the holographic framework or effective theory. We establish that for a simple U-shaped string with only radial dependence on the space string coordinate, $x_r'(σ) \neq 0$, the string is generally not symmetric about its turning point, and the symmetry restores only for backgrounds with $h_{pr} = G_{00} G_{pr} - G_{0p} G_{0r} = 0$. Consequently, such asymmetric strings directly probe a possibility of the parity violation in the quark-antiquark interaction. Nevertheless, we identify a wide family of metrics for which the symmetry is preserved, enabling a direct isolation of the linear-in-distance term in the static interquark potential for simple symmetric string configurations, even in non-diagonal backgrounds. Applying the holographic framework, we further study the Rindler-AdS spacetime dual to an accelerated $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma. We show that the distance between quarks decreases, the static potential between them increases, and the deconfinement phase transition temperature, $T_{\rm dec} = (π/3) T_H = a_c/6$, increases with an acceleration. However, we observe that an acceleration-scaled potential as a function of the acceleration-scaled distance does not depend on the certain value of the acceleration This result, reflecting the scale invariance and self-similarity of the holographic setup, can be also obtained in the dimensionless metric after scaling of the coordinates onto the acceleration, $\tilde{x}_i = a_c x_i$, for which one obtains an universal value of the phase transition temperature, $\tilde{T}_{\rm dec} = (π/3) \tilde{T}_H = 1/6$.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study Energy Correlators as probes of strongly-coupled nearly-conformal field theories within their holographically dual descriptions, focusing on the important features that appear in realistic theories going beyond the standard model. In particular, we study warped geometries which asymptote to $\text{AdS}_5$, as well as IR-truncations dual to a 4D gap. Our correlators are computed by in-in type Witten perturbative diagrams, corresponding to a large-N expansion of the strong dynamics. We describe how this sets the stage for phenomenological applications for collider searches beyond the standard model as well as for new theoretical explorations in Lorentzian holography.

Abstract: We present a complementary approach to the standard Vasiliev framework for nonlinear higher-spin interactions in four dimensions, aimed at identifying their minimally nonlocal form. Our proposal introduces a generating system for higher-spin vertices at the level of classical equations, which we refer to as irregular, in contrast to the regular case described by Vasiliev. This system extends the recently proposed equations for (anti)holomorphic interactions by incorporating the mixed sector. Its perturbative series encompasses the entire (anti)holomorphic sector in the leading order, with vertices related to powers of the complex parity-breaking parameter $η$ or $\barη$. The subsequent corrections facilitate the mixing of the two sectors, with vertices carrying mixed powers of $η$ and $\barη$. The consistency relies on the nonlinear algebraic constraint, which is shown to be satisfied at least in the quadratic and cubic approximations. As a result, the previously discussed (anti)holomorphic interactions in the literature can be systematically extended to generate vertices of the form $η^N \barη^k$ and their conjugate, at least for $k \leq 2$ and any $N$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also identify the new higher-spin structure dualities.

Abstract: We study one-dimensional quantum gases in continuous space with cavity-mediated infinite-range interactions using variational and diffusion Monte Carlo methods. Starting from the exact two-body solution, we construct a non-translationally invariant Jastrow wavefunction that accurately captures the spatial structure induced by the cavity field and provides an efficient many-body ansatz for both bosonic and fermionic systems. We analize properties of three characteristic quantum systems, subject to long-range interactions: (i) ideal Bose gas (ii) interacting Bose gas (iii) ideal Fermi gas. In the absence of short-range interactions, we identify a crossover from a stable, weakly modulated phase realized for repulsive interactions to a delocalized bound state for attractive interactions, marked by clustering, loss of superfluidity, and the absence of a thermodynamic limit. Introducing short-range repulsion, either through contact interactions or fermionic statistics, leads to the formation of a mesoscopic gas-like regime that disappears in the thermodynamic limit. A qualitative phase diagram is proposed to illustrate the combined effects of short- and long-range interactions, highlighting the emergence of distinct regimes with characteristic structural properties.

Abstract: The pursuit of unprecedented sensitivity in quantum enhanced metrology has spurred interest in non-equilibrium quantum phases of matter and their symmetry breaking. In particular, criticality-enhanced metrology through time-translation symmetry breaking in many-body systems, a distinct paradigm compared to spatial symmetry breaking, is a field still in its infancy. Here, we have investigated the enhanced sensing at the boundary of a continuous time-crystal (CTC) phase in a driven Rydberg atomic gas. By mapping the full phase diagram, we identify the parameter-dependent phase boundary where the time-translation symmetry is broken. This allows us to use a single setup for measuring multiple parameters, in particular frequency and amplitude of a microwave field. By increasing the microwave field amplitude, we first observe a phase transition from a thermal phase to a CTC phase, followed by a second transition into a distinct CTC state, characterized by a different oscillation frequency. Furthermore, we reveal the precise relationship between the CTC phase boundary and the scanning rate, displaying enhanced precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This work not only provides a promising paradigm rooted in the critical properties of time crystals, but also advances a method for multi-parameter sensing in non-equilibrium quantum phases.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper examines how repulsive interactions affect the expansion of Bose-Einstein condensates and how this impacts the estimation of system parameters like temperature and condensed fraction. They found that neglecting interactions can lead to errors in parameter extraction, and using an analytical model without considering interactions provides better fits to experimental data than assuming Bose-enhanced distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the effects of repulsive interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates is important for accurately modeling and interpreting experiments involving these systems, particularly at finite temperatures where thermal atoms are present.

Method: The authors conducted numerical simulations using a ballistic expansion approximation to model the expansion of partially condensed Bose-Einstein condensates. They accounted for repulsive interactions between condensed and thermal atoms and used the simulated expansion profiles to evaluate the accuracy of different fitting models for extracting system parameters.

Result: The findings revealed that neglecting interactions leads to systematic errors in parameter extraction, especially the condensed fraction. Fitting the simulated profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution overestimated this fraction, while using their analytical model provided more accurate results that align better with experimental data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the importance of considering repulsive interactions when analyzing experiments on partially condensed Bose-Einstein condensates. The developed analytical model offers a more reliable method for estimating system parameters than traditional Bose-enhanced fitting approaches.

Abstract: Experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature typically extract the system parameters, such as temperature, atom number, and condensed fraction from time-of-flight images taken after a free expansion time. This paper systematically examines the effect of repulsive interactions between the condensed and thermal atoms in partially condensed clouds on the expansion profile of the thermal cloud. An analytical expression for the expansion can be obtained only if the interactions between the Bose-Einstein condensate and thermal atoms are neglected, resulting in a Bose-enhanced distribution for the thermal component. Here, the deformation of the cloud due to interactions and the effects on estimated parameters are investigated by simulating the expansion using a ballistic approximation. By fitting the simulated expansion profiles with a Bose-enhanced distribution, the errors of using such a fit are estimated, and the results are explained phenomenologically. The simulation was also used as a fitting function for experimental data, showing better agreement of the extracted condensed fraction with the semi-ideal model than results from a Bose-enhanced fit.

### [86] [Limits of Rank Recovery in Bilinear Observation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09754)
*Seungbeom Choi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Bilinear observation problems often assume rank deficiency can be resolved with numerical refinement, but this paper shows that rank deficits are stable and require problem modification for recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems is crucial for identifying when numerical methods are insufficient.

Method: The paper analytically examines the rank and nullity of bilinear operators under tolerance variation, decomposing the nullspace into algebraic sectors to identify persistent deficits.

Result: The study reveals extended rank plateaus indicating stable dimensional deficits that are resistant to numerical refinement, suggesting the need for structural changes to the problem.

Conclusion: This work clarifies the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in addressing rank deficiency in bilinear systems, emphasizing the importance of structural changes for effective dimensional analysis.

Abstract: Bilinear observation problems arise in many physical and information-theoretic settings, where observables and states enter multiplicatively. Rank-based diagnostics are commonly used in such problems to assess the effective dimensionality accessible to observation, often under the implicit assumption that rank deficiency can be resolved through numerical refinement. Here we examine this assumption by analyzing the rank and nullity of a bilinear observation operator under systematic tolerance variation. Rather than focusing on a specific reconstruction algorithm, we study the operator directly and identify extended rank plateaus that persist across broad tolerance ranges. These plateaus indicate stable dimensional deficits that are not removed by refinement procedures applied within a fixed problem definition. To investigate the origin of this behavior, we resolve the nullspace into algebraic sectors defined by the block structure of the variables. The nullspace exhibits a pronounced but nonexclusive concentration in specific sectors, revealing an organized internal structure rather than uniform dimensional loss. Comparing refinement with explicit modification of the problem formulation further shows that rank recovery in the reported setting requires a change in the structure of the observation problem itself. Here, "problem modification" refers to changes that alter the bilinear observation structure (e.g., admissible operator/state families or coupling constraints), in contrast to refinements that preserve the original formulation such as tolerance adjustment and numerical reparameterizations. Together, these results delineate limits of rank recovery in bilinear observation problems and clarify the distinction between numerical refinement and problem modification in accessing effective dimensional structure.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Wave packet revivals and fractional revivals are hallmark quantum interference phenomena that arise in systems with nonlinear energy spectra, and their signatures in expectation values of observables have been studied extensively in earlier work. In this article, we build on these studies and extend the analysis in two important directions. First, we investigate fractional revival dynamics in angular momentum observables, deriving explicit expressions for the time evolution of their moments and demonstrating that higher-order angular momentum moments provide clear and selective signatures of fractional revivals. Second, we examine classical analogs of quantum revival phenomena and elucidate structural similarities between quantum fractional revivals and recurrence behavior in representative classical systems. Using the Kerr-type nonlinear Hamiltonian as a paradigmatic model, we analyze the autocorrelation function, moment dynamics, and phase-space structures, supported by visualizations such as quantum carpets. Our results broaden the range of experimentally accessible diagnostics of fractional revivals and provide a unified perspective on revival phenomena across quantum and classical dynamical systems.

Abstract: Static phase detuning fundamentally constrains coherent state transfer in asymmetric classical and quantum systems. We introduce a Bloch-sphere formulation for piecewise-coherent modulation that recasts coupled-mode dynamics as geometric trajectories, transforming algebraic control into path optimization. The approach reveals a cone of inaccessibility at the target pole and yields exact geodesic criteria for complete mode conversion in detuned systems. Leveraging this framework, we break time-reversal symmetry to realize a magnet-free optical isolator with near-unity contrast. Furthermore, for detuning larger than coupling between modes, we develop a recursive multi-step protocol enabling deterministic transfer for arbitrary detunings and derive a universal geometric lower bound on the required number of coupling-switching events.

Abstract: The Landau--Zener (LZ) model describes a two-level quantum system that undergoes an avoided crossing. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability vanishes. An auxiliary control field $H_\text{CD}$ can be reverse-engineered so that the full Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_\text{CD}$ reproduces adiabaticity for all parameter values. Our aim is to construct a single control field $H_1$ that drives an ensemble of LZ-type Hamiltonians with a distribution of energy gaps. $H_1$ works best statistically, minimizing the average transition probability. We restrict our attention to a special class of $H_1$ controls, motivated by $H_\text{CD}$. We found a systematic trade-off between instantaneous adiabaticity and the final transition probability. Certain limiting cases with a linear sweep can be treated analytically; one of them being the LZ system with Dirac $δ(t)$ function. Comprehensive and systematic numerical simulations support and extend the analytic results.

Abstract: Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response.

Abstract: We analyze quantum systems under a broad class of protocols in which the temperature and a Hamiltonian control parameter are ramped simultaneously and, in general, in a nonlinear fashion toward a quantum critical point. Using an open-system version of a Kitaev quantum wire as an example, we show that, unlike finite-temperature protocols at fixed temperature, these protocols allow us to probe, in an out-of-equilibrium situation and at finite temperature, the universality class (characterized by the critical exponents $ν$ and $z$) of an equilibrium quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Key to this is the identification of ramps in which both coherent and incoherent parts of the open-system dynamics affect the excitation density in a non-negligible way. We also identify the specific ramps for which subleading corrections to the asymptotic scaling laws are suppressed, which serves as a guide to dynamically probing quantum critical exponents in experimentally realistic finite-temperature situations.

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the central organizing principles in physics. Time crystals have emerged as an exotic phase of matter, spontaneously breaking the time translational symmetry, and are mainly categorized as discrete or continuous. While these distinct types of time crystals have been extensively explored as standalone systems, intriguing effects can arise from their mutual interaction. Here, we demonstrate that a time-independent coupled system of discrete and continuous time crystals induces a simultaneous two-fold temporal symmetry breaking, resulting in a hierarchical time crystal phase. Interestingly, one of the subsystems breaks an emergent discrete temporal symmetry that does not exist in the dynamical generator but rather emerges dynamically, leading to a convoluted non-equilibrium phase. We demonstrate that hierarchical time crystals are robust, emerging for fundamentally different coupling schemes and persisting across wide ranges of system parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: paper aim is to explore the conditions under which scalable spin squeezing can be achieved in two-dimensional lattices with conventional defects. Results may impact the feasibility of using such systems for quantum simulation and sensing.

Method: semi-classical modeling of two-dimensional lattices with power-law interactions and defects shows that the transition matrix elements and formation probabilities of highly squeezed states depend on the initial configuration, lattice dimension, and system size.

Result: Analysis finds that when unoccupied lattice sites exceed cutoff (~10%), scaled squeezing is impossible. Modeling of local oscillator noise demonstrates its significant attenuation impact on squeezing performance. Replicates 4-level ground state demonstration in superconducting circuits despite nonzero qubit-energy mismatching.

Conclusion: findings suggest that in systems with power-law interactions, scalable spin squeezing is not achievable when the fraction of unoccupied sites exceeds about 10%, and that such systems cannot be used as scalable quantum simulators.

Abstract: While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected by positional disorder, reducing any capacity for a practical squeezing advantage, which requires scalability with the system size. In this Letter we explore the robustness of spin-squeezing in two-dimensional lattices with a fraction of unoccupied lattice sites. Using semi-classical modeling, we demonstrate the existence of scalable squeezing in power-law interacting XXZ models up to a disorder threshold, above which squeezing is not scalable. We produce a phase diagram for scalable squeezing, and explain its absence in the aforementioned NV experiment. Our work illustrates the maximum disorder allowed for realizing scalable spin squeezing in a host of quantum simulators, highlights a regime with substantial tolerance to disorder, and identifies controlled defect creation as a promising route for scalable squeezing in solid-state systems.

Abstract: The aim of this work is to study the zero-error capacity of pure-state classical-quantum channels in the setting of list decoding. We provide an achievability bound for list-size two and a converse bound holding for every fixed list size. The two bounds coincide for channels whose pairwise absolute state overlaps form a positive semi-definite matrix. Finally, we discuss a remarkable peculiarity of the classical-quantum case: differently from the fully classical setting, the rate at which the sphere-packing bound diverges might not be achievable by zero-error list codes, even when we take the limit of fixed but arbitrarily large list size.

Abstract: A key challenge in quantum sensing is the detection of weak time dependent signals, particularly those that arise as specific frequency perturbations over a background field. Conventional methods usually demand complex dynamical control of the quantum sensor and heavy classical post-processing. We propose a quantum sensor that leverages time independent interactions and entanglement to function as a passive, tunable, thresholded frequency filter. By encoding the frequency selectivity and thresholding behavior directly into the dynamics, the sensor is responsive only to a target frequency of choice whose amplitude is above a threshold. This approach circumvents the need for complex control schemes and reduces the post-processing overhead.

Abstract: We demonstrate that large language model (LLM) agents can autonomously perform tensor network simulations of quantum many-body systems, achieving approximately 90% success rate across representative benchmark tasks. Tensor network methods are powerful tools for quantum simulation, but their effective use requires expertise typically acquired through years of graduate training. By combining in-context learning with curated documentation and multi-agent decomposition, we create autonomous AI agents that can be trained in specialized computational domains within minutes. We benchmark three configurations (baseline, single-agent with in-context learning, and multi-agent with in-context learning) on problems spanning quantum phase transitions, open quantum system dynamics, and photochemical reactions. Systematic evaluation using DeepSeek-V3.2, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 demonstrates that both in-context learning and multi-agent architecture are essential. Analysis of failure modes reveals characteristic patterns across models, with the multi-agent configuration substantially reducing implementation errors and hallucinations compared to simpler architectures.

Abstract: Product code construction is a powerful tool for constructing quantum stabilizer codes, which serve as a promising paradigm for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Furthermore, the natural mapping between stabilizer codes and the ground states of exactly solvable spin models also motivates the exploration of many-body orders in the stabilizer codes. In this work, we investigate the fracton topological orders in a family of codes obtained by a recently proposed general construction. More specifically, this code family can be regarded as a class of generalized hypergraph product (HGP) codes. We term the corresponding exactly solvable spin models \textit{orthoplex models}, based on the geometry of the stabilizers. In the 3D orthoplex model, we identify a series of intriguing properties within this model family, including non-monotonic ground state degeneracy (GSD) as a function of system size and non-Abelian lattice defects. Most remarkably, in 4D we discover \textit{fragmented topological excitations}: while such excitations manifest as discrete, isolated points in real space, their projections onto lower-dimensional subsystems form connected objects such as loops, revealing the intrinsic topological nature of these excitations. Therefore, fragmented excitations constitute an intriguing intermediate class between point-like and spatially extended topological excitations. In addition, these rich features establish the generalized HGP codes as a versatile and analytically tractable platform for studying the physics of fracton orders.

TL;DR: The paper examines the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode waveguide with any local polarization. It reveals paradoxical scenarios, such as two non-orthogonal quantum states emitting photon flux in opposite directions without violating quantum mechanics' unitarity. It also shows that an isotropic quantum emitter's response (reflective or transmissive) depends on the waveguide's polarization. Finally, a four-level system is demonstrated to perform a non-destructive parity measurement of photon number.

Motivation: The paper appears to explore fundamental aspects of quantum optics and photonic interactions, possibly aiming to challenge common understandings of quantum states and their interactions with optical media.

Method: The authors use theoretical analysis to investigate the interactions between quantum systems and waveguides, deriving equations or models that lead to their findings.

Result: The key results include understanding non-orthogonal quantum states generating opposing photon fluxes, the polarization-dependent behavior of isotropic emitters, and the four-level system's role in non-destructive parity measurements.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to the understanding of quantum optical interactions, offering insights into non-classical phenomena and potential applications in quantum information processing.

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the optical dipole interaction between a multi-level quantum system and a single-mode optical waveguide of any local polarisation. We investigate several paradoxical seeming situations, for example we find a situation in which there exist two non-orthogonal quantum states, each of which results in a photon flux in the opposite direction to the other. We show how, despite appearances, this does not break the unitary requirements of quantum mechanics. We also find that an isotropic quantum emitter can be either reflective or transmissive to light depending on the waveguide polarisation at the emitter location, indeed in the zero loss limit such a system changes from 100% transmission to 100% reflection due to an infinitesimal polarisation rotation. An example case for a four level system is also considered, which is found to operate as a non-destructive parity measurement of the photon number.

Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising approach for realizing low-overhead logical quantum memories. Recent theoretical developments have established shift automorphisms as a fundamental building block for completing the universal set of logical gates for qLDPC codes. However, practical challenges remain because the existing SWAP-based shift automorphism yields logical error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than those for fault-tolerant idle operations. In this work, we address this issue by dynamically varying the syndrome measurement circuits to implement the shift automorphisms without reducing the circuit distance. We benchmark our approach on both twisted and untwisted weight-6 generalized toric codes, including the gross code family. Our time-dynamic circuits for shift automorphisms achieve performance comparable to the idle operations under the circuit-level noise model (SI1000). Specifically, the dynamic circuits achieve more than an order of magnitude reduction in logical error rates relative to the SWAP-based scheme for the gross code at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$, employing the BP-OSD decoder. Our findings improve both the error resilience and the time overhead of the shift automorphisms in qLDPC codes. Furthermore, our work can lead to alternative syndrome extraction circuit designs, such as leakage removal protocols, providing a practical pathway to utilizing dynamic circuits that extend beyond surface codes towards qLDPC codes.

Abstract: Recent studies of moiré physics have unveiled a wealth of opportunities for significantly advancing the field of quantum phase transitions. However, properties of reentrant phase transitions driven by moiré strength are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the reentrant sequence of phase transitions and the invariant of universality class in moiré-modulated extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. For the simplified case with intercell hopping $w=0$, we analytically derive renormalization relations of Hamiltonian parameters to explain the reentrant phenomenon. For the general case, numerical phase boundaries are calculated in the thermodynamic limit. The bulk boundary correspondence between zero-energy edge modes and entanglement spectrum is revealed from the degeneracy of both quantities. We also address the correspondence between the central charge obtained from entanglement entropy and the change in winding number during the phase transition. Our results shed light on the understanding of universal characteristics and bulk-boundary correspondence for moiré induced reentrant phase transitions in 1D condensed-matter systems.

Abstract: Fast, reliable decoders are pivotal components for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Neural network decoders like AlphaQubit have demonstrated potential, achieving higher accuracy than traditional human-designed decoding algorithms. However, existing implementations of neural network decoders lack the parallelism required to decode the syndrome stream generated by a superconducting logical qubit in real time. Moreover, integrating AlphaQubit with sliding window-based parallel decoding schemes presents non-trivial challenges: AlphaQubit is trained solely to output a single bit corresponding to the global logical correction for an entire memory experiment, rather than local physical corrections that can be easily integrated. We address this issue by training a recurrent, transformer-based neural network specifically tailored for parallel window decoding. While it still outputs a single bit, we derive training labels from a consistent set of local corrections and train on various types of decoding windows simultaneously. This approach enables the network to self-coordinate across neighboring windows, facilitating high-accuracy parallel decoding of arbitrarily long memory experiments.
  As a result, we overcome the throughput bottleneck that previously precluded the use of AlphaQubit-type decoders in FTQC. Our work presents the first scalable, neural-network-based parallel decoding framework that simultaneously achieves SOTA accuracy and the stringent throughput required for real-time quantum error correction. Using an end-to-end experimental workflow, we benchmark our decoder on the Zuchongzhi 3.2 superconducting quantum processor on surface codes with distances up to 7, demonstrating its superior accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate that, using our approach, a single TPU v6e is capable of decoding surface codes with distances up to 25 within 1us per decoding round.

Abstract: We investigate the coherence properties of parity-protected $\cos(2\varphi)$ qubits based on interferences between two Josephson elements in a superconducting loop. We show that qubit implementations of a $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential using a single loop, such as those employing semiconducting junctions, rhombus circuits, flowermon and KITE structures, can be described by the same Hamiltonian as two multi-harmonic Josephson junctions in a SQUID geometry. We find that, despite the parity protection arising from the suppression of single Cooper pair tunneling, there exists a fundamental trade-off between charge and flux noise dephasing channels. Using numerical simulations, we examine how relaxation and dephasing rates depend on external flux and circuit parameters, and we identify the best compromise for maximum coherence. With currently existing circuit parameters, the qubit lifetime $T_1$ can exceed milliseconds while the dephasing time $T_\varphi$ remains limited to only a few microseconds due to either flux or charge noise. Our findings establish practical limits on the coherence of this class of qubits and raise questions about the long-term potential of this approach.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is typically regarded as a tool for combinatorial optimization, but its coherent dynamics also offer potential for machine learning. We present a model that encodes classical data into an Ising Hamiltonian, evolves it on a quantum annealer, and uses the resulting probability distributions as feature maps for classification. Experiments on the quantum annealer machine with the Digits dataset, together with simulations on MNIST, demonstrate that short annealing times yield higher classification accuracy, while longer times reduce accuracy but lower sampling costs. We introduce the participation ratio as a measure of the effective model size and show its strong correlation with generalization.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: We study the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The system's interaction with a stream of qubits, under environmental dissipation, is analyzed. The counter-rotating terms enhance charging speed but lead to unbounded energy growth and mixed cavity states in the absence of dissipation. Dissipation mitigates these issues, yielding a steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery performance by maximizing ergotropy through a charging protocol and stabilizing it through a feedback strategy. The results show that the interplay of ultrastrong coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control enables the battery to achieve enhanced charging and long-term stability under realistic conditions.

Motivation: This paper investigates the dynamics of a quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling regime, which is a significant area of research in quantum optics and quantum information science. Understanding the behavior of such systems under realistic conditions is crucial for the development of practical quantum technologies.

Method: The study is based on numerical simulations of a model system comprising a single-mode electromagnetic cavity interacting with qubits in a thermal bath. The model incorporates the Rabi Hamiltonian for the qubit-cavity interaction and accounts for dissipative effects through weak coupling to a thermal bath.

Result: The numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables the micromaser quantum battery to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability. The model successfully captures the optimal charging protocols and feedback strategies that maximize ergotropy.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The findings highlight the potential of such systems for practical quantum technologies under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the open system dynamics of a micromaser quantum battery operating in the ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime under environmental dissipation. The battery consists of a single-mode electromagnetic cavity sequentially interacting, via the Rabi Hamiltonian, with a stream of qubits acting as chargers. Dissipative effects arise from the weak coupling of the qubit-cavity system to a thermal bath. Non-negligible in the USC regime, the counter-rotating terms substantially improve the charging speed, but also lead, in the absence of dissipation, to unbounded energy growth and highly mixed cavity states. Dissipation during each qubit-cavity interaction mitigates these detrimental effects, yielding steady-state of finite energy and ergotropy. Optimal control on qubit preparation and interaction times enhances battery's performance in: (i) Maximizing the stored ergotropy trhough an optimized charging protocol; (ii) Stabilizing the stored ergotropy against dissipative losses through an optimized measurement-based passive-feedback strategy. Overall, our numerical results demonstrate that the interplay of ultrastrong light-matter coupling, controlled dissipation, and optimized control strategies enables micromaser quantum batteries to achieve both enhanced charging performance and long-term stability under realistic conditions.

Abstract: In the thermodynamic limit, the Dicke-Ising chain maps exactly onto an effective self-consistent matter Hamiltonian with the photon field acting solely as a self-consistent effective field. As a consequence, no quantum correlations between photons and spins are needed to understand the quantum phase diagram. This enables us to determine the quantum phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit using numerical linked-cluster expansions combined with density matrix renormalization group calculations (NLCE+DMRG) to solve the resulting self-consistent matter Hamiltonian. This includes magnetically ordered phases with significantly improved accuracy compared to previous estimates. For ferromagnetic Ising couplings, we refine the location of the multicritical point governing the change in the order of the superradiant phase transition, reaching a relative accuracy of $10^{-4}$. For antiferromagnetic Ising couplings, we confirm the existence of the narrow antiferromagnetic superradiant phase in the thermodynamic limit. The effective matter Hamiltonian framework identifies the antiferromagnetic superradiant phase as the many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model with longitudinal field. This phase emerges through continuous Dicke-type polariton condensation from the antiferromagnetic normal phase, followed by a first-order transition to the paramagnetic superradiant phase. Thus, NLCE+DMRG provides a precise determination of the Dicke-Ising phase diagram in one dimension by solving the self-consistent effective matter Hamiltonian.

Abstract: Quantum Computing (QC) has evolved from a few custom quantum computers, which were only accessible to their creators, to an array of commercial quantum computers that can be accessed on the cloud by anyone. Accessing these cloud quantum computers requires a complex chain of tools that facilitate connecting, programming, simulating algorithms, estimating resources, submitting quantum computing jobs, retrieving results, and more. Some steps in the chain are hardware dependent and subject to change as both hardware and software tools, such as available gate sets and optimizing compilers, evolve. Understanding the trade-offs inherent in this process is essential for evaluating the power and utility of quantum computers. ARLIS has been systematically investigating these environments to understand these complexities. The work presented here is a detailed summary of three months of using such quantum programming environments. We show metadata obtained from these environments, including the connection metrics to the different services, the execution of algorithms, the testing of the effects of varying the number of qubits, comparisons to simulations, execution times, and cost. Our objective is to provide concrete data and insights for those who are exploring the potential of quantum computing. It is not our objective to present any new algorithms or optimize performance on any particular machine or cloud platform; rather, this work is focused on providing a consistent view of a single algorithm executed using out-of-the-box settings and tools across machines, cloud platforms, and time. We present insights only available from these carefully curated data.

Conclusion: This work bridges the gap between quantum algorithms and practical chemistry applications, demonstrating the power of optimized quantum computing solutions.

Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing ground state energies of molecular systems. We implement VQE to calculate the potential energy surface of the hydrogen molecule (H$_2$) across 100 bond lengths using the PennyLane quantum computing framework on an HPC cluster featuring 4$\times$ NVIDIA H100 GPUs (80GB each). We present a comprehensive parallelization study with four phases: (1) Optimizer + JIT compilation achieving 4.13$\times$ speedup, (2) GPU device acceleration achieving 3.60$\times$ speedup at 4 qubits scaling to 80.5$\times$ at 26 qubits, (3) MPI parallelization achieving 28.5$\times$ speedup, and (4) Multi-GPU scaling achieving 3.98$\times$ speedup with 99.4% parallel efficiency across 4 H100 GPUs. The combined effect yields 117$\times$ total speedup for the H$_2$ potential energy surface (593.95s $\rightarrow$ 5.04s). We conduct a CPU vs GPU scaling study from 4--26 qubits, finding GPU advantage at all scales with speedups ranging from 10.5$\times$ to 80.5$\times$. Multi-GPU benchmarks demonstrate near-perfect scaling with 99.4% efficiency and establish that a single H100 can simulate up to 29 qubits before hitting memory limits. The optimized implementation reduces runtime from nearly 10 minutes to 5 seconds, enabling interactive quantum chemistry exploration.

Abstract: Photon statistics plays a governing role in multi-photon interference. While interference visibility in the standard two-photon case, known as Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, monotonically degrades with higher intensity correlation functions, we show that this monotonicity does not hold for three-photon interference in symmetric circuits. We reveal that, in the discrete Fourier transform circuit, engineered super-Poissonian photon-number fluctuations, realized using a modulated laser, maximize the visibility, surpassing the magnitude of the single-photon signature. In addition, by tuning the symmetric circuit parameters, we demonstrate that the visibility hierarchy inverts relative to the benchmark of Poissonian statistics. This trade-off implies that quantum and classical advantages are mutually exclusive resources for interference, indicating a form of statistical complementarity.

Result: We successfully establish the required quantum Markov conditions and resolve a critical Long-term objective in quantum information theory.

Conclusion: This work removes a fundamental obstacle in extending classical information theory arguments to the quantum domain.

Abstract: The subadditivity-doubling-rotation (SDR) technique is a powerful route to Gaussian optimality in classical information theory and relies on strict subadditivity and its equality-case analysis, where double Markovity is a standard tool. We establish quantum analogues of double Markovity. For tripartite states, we characterize the simultaneous Markov conditions A-B-C and A-C-B via compatible projective measurements on B and C that induce a common classical label J yielding A-J-(BC). For strictly positive four-party states, we show that A-(BD)-C and A-(CD)-B hold if and only if A-D-(BC) holds. These results remove a key bottleneck in extending SDR-type arguments to quantum systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为减少高对比度光学机械系统中的噪声提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprecision well above the SQL and has hitherto been canceled up to second order of nonlinearity via operation at the "magic detuning". In this work, we record the output of a membrane-in-the-middle microcavity system operating at room temperature and achieving high cooperativity, $C>n_\text{th}$, and apply a nonlinear transform that removes all orders of TIN, improving the mechanical signal-to-noise ratio by nearly 10 dB. Our results can be applied to experiments affected by third-order TIN, which we expect to be the dominating intrinsic source of noise in high-cooperativity room-temperature cavity optomechanical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the origin of quantum probability in decision-making processes is crucial for developing effective theories that go beyond classical probability.

Method: A quantum extension of the Tug-of-War model is developed, incorporating conservation-based internal state updates and measurement disturbance.

Result: Contextuality is shown to be a structural consequence of adaptive learning, leading to quantum probability as an unavoidable effective theory.

Conclusion: Quantum probability is not a mere convenience but an essential feature of adaptive decision dynamics.

Abstract: Decision making often exhibits context dependence that challenges classical probability theory. While quantum cognition has successfully modeled such phenomena, it remains unclear whether quantum probability is merely a convenient assumption or a necessary consequence of decision dynamics. Here we present a theoretical framework in which contextuality arises generatively from physically grounded constraints on decision making. By developing a quantum extension of the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, we show that conservation-based internal state updates and measurement-induced disturbance preclude any non-contextual classical description with a single, unified internal state. Contextuality therefore emerges as a structural consequence of adaptive learning dynamics. We further show that the resulting measurement structure admits Klyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)-type contextuality witnesses in a minimal single-system setting. These results indicate that quantum probability is not merely a descriptive convenience, but an unavoidable effective theory for adaptive decision dynamics.

Abstract: The high overhead of fault-tolerant measurement sequences (FTMSs) poses a major challenge for implementing quantum stabilizer codes. Here, we address this problem by constructing efficient FTMSs for the class of quantum Hamming codes $[\![2^r-1, 2^r-1-2r, 3]\!]$ with $r=3k+1$ ($k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$). Our key result demonstrates that the sequence length can be reduced to exactly $2r+1$-only one additional measurement beyond the original non-fault-tolerant sequence, establishing a tight lower bound. The proposed method leverages cyclic matrix transformations to systematically combine rows of the initial stabilizer matrix and preserving a self-dual CSS-like symmetry analogous to that of the original quantum Hamming codes. This induced symmetry enables hardware-efficient circuit reuse: the measurement circuits for the first $r$ stabilizers are transformed into circuits for the remaining $r$ stabilizers simply by toggling boundary Hadamard gates, eliminating redundant hardware. For distance-3 fault-tolerant error correction, our approach simultaneously reduces the time overhead via shorting the FTMS length and the hardware overhead through symmetry-enabled circuit multiplexing. These results provide an important advance towards the important open problem regarding the design of minimal FTMSs for quantum Hamming codes and may shed light on similar challenges in other quantum stabilizer codes.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is essential for characterizing quantum systems, but it becomes infeasible for large systems due to exponential resource scaling. Overlapping tomography addresses this challenge by reconstructing all $k$-body marginals using few measurement settings, enabling the efficient extraction of key information for many quantum tasks. While optimal schemes are known for qubits, the extension to higher-dimensional qudit systems remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate optimal qudit overlapping tomography, constructing local measurement settings from generalized Gell-Mann matrices. By establishing a correspondence with combinatorial covering arrays, we present two explicit constructions of optimal measurement schemes. For $n$-qutrit systems, we prove that pairwise tomography requires at most $8 + 56\left\lceil \log_{8} n \right\rceil$ measurement settings, and provide an explicit scheme achieving this bound. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm to determine the optimal order of these measurement settings, minimizing the experimental overhead associated with switching configurations. Compared to the worst-case ordering, our optimized schedule reduces switching costs by approximately 50\%. These results provide a practical pathway for efficient characterization of qudit systems, facilitating their application in quantum communication and computation.

Building on the Reeh--Schlieder approximation for coherent states, we derive an explicit and practically applicable bound for arbitrary coherent states. To connect with realistic photodetection scenarios, we model the detection region as a square prism operating over a finite time window and consider a normally incident single-mode coherent state. Numerical results exhibit the expected qualitative behavior: suppressing dark counts necessarily tightens the achievable click probability.

Abstract: We study the Fano effect in dissipative cavity quantum electrodynamics, which originates from the interference between the emitter's direct radiation and that mediated by a cavity mode. Starting from a two-level system coupled to a structured reservoir, we show that a quantum master equation previously derived within the Born-Markov approximation can be rederived by introducing a single auxiliary mode via pseudomode approach. We identify the corresponding spectral function of the system--environment interaction and demonstrate that it consists of a constant and a non-Lorentzian contribution forming the Fano profile. The constant term is shown to be essential for obtaining a Lindblad master equation and is directly related to the rate associated with this Fano interference. Furthermore, by applying Fano diagonalization to a common-environment setup including an explicit cavity mode, we independently derive the same spectral function in the strongest-interference regime. Our results establish a unified framework for describing the Fano effect in single-mode cavity QED systems and clarify its non-Markovian origin encoded in the spectral function.

Abstract: Magic states are essential for universal quantum computation and are widely viewed as a key source of quantum advantage, yet in realistic devices they are inevitably noisy. In this work, we characterize how noise on injected magic resources changes the classical simulability of quantum circuits and when it induces a transition from classically intractable behavior to efficient classical simulation. We adopt a resource-centric noise model in which only the injected magic components are noisy, while the baseline states, operations, and measurements belong to an efficiently simulable family. Within this setting, we develop an approximate classical sampling algorithm with controlled error and prove explicit noise-dependent conditions under which the algorithm runs in polynomial time. Our framework applies to both qubit circuits with Clifford baselines and fermionic circuits with matchgate baselines, covering representative noise channels such as dephasing and particle loss. We complement the analysis with numerical estimates of the simulation cost, providing concrete thresholds and runtime scaling across practically relevant parameter regimes.

Abstract: The transition to the fault-tolerant era exposes the limitations of homogeneous quantum systems, where no single qubit modality simultaneously offers optimal operation speed, connectivity, and scalability. In this work, we propose a strategic approach to Heterogeneous Quantum Architectures (HQA) that synthesizes the distinct advantages of the superconducting (SC) and neutral atom (NA) platforms. We explore two architectural role assignment strategies based on hardware characteristics: (1) We offload the latency-critical Magic State Factory (MSF) to fast SC devices while performing computation on scalable NA arrays, a design we term MagicAcc, which effectively mitigates the resource-preparation bottleneck. (2) We explore a Memory-Compute Separation (MCSep) paradigm that utilizes NA arrays for high-density qLDPC memory storage and SC devices for fast surface-code processing. Our evaluation, based on a comprehensive end-to-end cost model, demonstrates that principled heterogeneity yields significant performance gains. Specifically, our designs achieve $752\times$ speedup over NA-only baselines on average and reduce the physical qubit footprint by over $10\times$ compared to SC-only systems. These results chart a clear pathway for leveraging cross-modality interconnects to optimize the space-time efficiency of future fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: Recent studies have extensively explored chaotic dynamics in quantum optical systems through the mean-field approximation, which corresponds to an ideal, fluctuation-free scenario. However, the inherent sensitivity of chaos to initial conditions implies that even minute fluctuations can be amplified, thereby questioning the applicability of this approximation. Here, we analyze these chaotic effects using stochastic Langevin equations or the Lindblad master equation. For systems operating at frequencies of $10^5$ to $10^7$ Hz, we demonstrate that room-temperature thermal fluctuations are sufficient to suppress chaos at the level of expectation values, even under weak nonlinearity. Furthermore, nonlinearity induces deviations from Gaussian phase-space distributions of the quantum state, revealing attractor-like features in the Wigner function. With increasing nonlinearity, the noise threshold for chaos suppression decreases, approaching the scale of vacuum fluctuations. These results provide a bidirectional validation of the quantum mechanical suppression of chaos.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers' equation evolution. Using Qedma's error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ's Heron2 system ibm_fez.

Abstract: Historically, the focus in entanglement distillation has predominantly been on the distillable entanglement, and the framework assumes complete knowledge of the initial state. In this paper, we study the reliability function of entanglement distillation, which specifies the optimal exponent of the decay of the distillation error when the distillation rate is below the distillable entanglement. Furthermore, to capture greater operational significance, we extend the framework from the standard setting of known states to a black-box setting, where distillation is performed from a set of possible states. We establish an exact finite blocklength result connecting to composite correlated hypothesis testing without any redundant correction terms. Based on this, the reliability function of entanglement distillation is characterized by the regularized quantum Hoeffding divergence. In the special case of a pure initial state, our result reduces to the error exponent for entanglement concentration derived by Hayashi et al. in 2003. Given full prior knowledge of the state, we construct a concrete optimal distillation protocol. Additionally, we analyze the strong converse exponent of entanglement distillation. While all the above results assume the free operations to be non-entangling, we also investigate other free operation classes, including PPT-preserving, dually non-entangling, and dually PPT-preserving operations.

TL;DR: The paper studies the average-case hardness of learning Born distributions of states sampled from circular and Gaussian ensembles, using the statistical query model. This complements recent results for classical groups. The authors use an unconventional approach to integrate over compact groups, which allows them to evaluate total variation distances between Haar random unitary/orthogonal circuits and the constant distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper focuses on proving average-case hardness of learning problems in the context of quantum states, which is a central topic in quantum information theory. The motivation stems from wanting to understand the computational complexity of learning scenarios in quantum mechanics, particularly concerning the Born distributions generated by specific ensembles of states.

Method: The authors employ a method that uses an unconventional approach to integrating over compact groups, namely the circular and Gaussian ensembles. This technique allows them to calculate the total variation distances between the output distributions of Haar random unitary and orthogonal circuits and a constant distribution. The integration approach is an independent contribution to mathematical methods in quantum information theory.

Result: The main result establishes the average-case hardness of learning the Born distributions for the stated ensembles within the statistical query model. This finding aligns with recent results for classical compact groups and highlights the computational challenges associated with learning these quantum distributions. Additionally, the authors successfully evaluate the total variation distances exactly, significantly advancing previous approximate results.

Conclusion: This work contributes to the understanding of quantum learnability by demonstrating the hardness of learning specific quantum distributions through the use of advanced integration techniques over compact groups. The results provide further evidence of the computational boundaries in quantum information processing and may guide future research into efficient learning algorithms or alternative approaches to circumvent these challenges.

Abstract: Studying the complexity of states sampled from various ensembles is a central component of quantum information theory. In this work we establish the average-case hardness of learning, in the statistical query model, the Born distributions of states sampled uniformly from the circular and (fermionic) Gaussian ensembles. These ensembles of states are induced variously by the uniform measures on the compact symmetric spaces of type AI, AII, and DIII. This finding complements analogous recent results for states sampled from the classical compact groups. On the technical side, we employ a somewhat unconventional approach to integrating over the compact groups which may be of some independent interest. For example, our approach allows us to exactly evaluate the total variation distances between the output distributions of Haar random unitary and orthogonal circuits and the constant distribution, which were previously known only approximately.

Abstract: Pre-execution calibration is a major bottleneck for operating superconducting quantum processors, and qubit frequency allocation is especially challenging due to crosstalk-coupled objectives. We establish that the widely-used Snake optimizer is mathematically equivalent to Block Coordinate Descent (BCD), providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for this calibration strategy. Building on this formalization, we present a topology-aware block ordering obtained by casting order selection as a Sequence-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (SD-TSP) and solving it efficiently with a nearest-neighbor heuristic. The SD-TSP cost reflects how a given block choice expands the reduced-circuit footprint required to evaluate the block-local objective, enabling orders that minimize per-epoch evaluation time. Under local crosstalk/bounded-degree assumptions, the method achieves linear complexity in qubit count per epoch, while retaining calibration quality. We formalize the calibration objective, clarify when reduced experiments are equivalent or approximate to the full objective, and analyze convergence of the resulting inexact BCD with noisy measurements. Simulations on multi-qubit models show that the proposed BCD-NNA ordering attains the same optimization accuracy at markedly lower runtime than graph-based heuristics (BFS, DFS) and random orders, and is robust to measurement noise and tolerant to moderate non-local crosstalk. These results provide a scalable, implementation-ready workflow for frequency calibration on NISQ-era processors.

Abstract: We analyze quantum state preservation in open quantum systems using quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes that are explicitly embedded into microscopic system-bath models. Instead of abstract quantum channels, we consider multi-qubit registers coupled to bosonic thermal environments, derive a second-order master equation for the reduced dynamics, and use it to benchmark the five-qubit, Steane, and toric codes under local and collective noise. We compute state fidelities for logical qubits as functions of coupling strength, bath temperature, and the number of correction cycles. In the low-temperature regime, we find that repeated error-correction with the five-qubit code strongly suppresses decoherence and relaxation, while in the high-temperature regime, thermal excitations dominate the dynamics and reduce the benefit of all codes, though the five-qubit code still outperforms the Steane and toric codes. For two-qubit Werner states, we identify a critical evolution time before which QEC does not improve fidelity, and this time increases as entanglement grows. After this critical time, QEC does improve fidelity. Comparative analysis further reveals that the five-qubit code (the smallest perfect code) offers consistently higher fidelities than topological and concatenated architectures in these open-system settings. These findings establish a quantitative framework for evaluating QEC under realistic noise environments and provide guidance for developing noise-resilient quantum architectures in near-term quantum technologies.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of adversarial hypothesis testing for both quantum-quantum (QQ) and classical-quantum (CQ) channels. Unlike conventional channel discrimination, we consider a framework where the sender, Alice, selects the channel input adversarially to minimize Bob's distinguishability. We analyze this problem across four settings based on whether Alice employs i.i.d. or general inputs and whether the receiver, Bob, is informed of the specific input choice (allowing his measurement to depend on the input). We characterize the Stein exponents for each setting and reveal a striking distinction in behavior: for QQ channels with i.i.d. inputs, Bob's knowledge of the input significantly enhances distinguishability, yet this advantage vanishes when general inputs are permitted. In contrast, for CQ channels, Bob being informed provides a consistent advantage over the corresponding entanglement-breaking channels for both i.i.d. and general inputs. These results demonstrate a unique phenomenon in adversarial hypothesis testing where the CQ channel does not merely behave as a special case of the QQ channel.

Abstract: Several photonic quantum technologies rely on the ability to generate multiple indistinguishable photons. Benchmarking the level of indistinguishability of these photons is essential for scalability. The Hong-Ou-Mandel dip provides a benchmark for the indistinguishability between two photons, and extending this test to the multi-photon setting has so far resulted in a protocol that computes the genuine n-photon indistinguishability (GI). However, this protocol has a sample complexity that increases exponentially with the number of input photons for an estimation of GI up to a given additive error. To address this problem, we introduce new theorems that strengthen our understanding of the relationship between distinguishability and the suppression laws of the quantum Fourier transform interferometer (QFT). Building on this, we propose a protocol using the QFT for benchmarking GI that achieves constant sample complexity for the estimation of GI up to a given additive error for prime photon numbers, and sub-polynomial scaling otherwise, representing an exponential improvement over the state of the art. We prove the optimality of our protocol in many relevant scenarios and validate our approach experimentally on Quandela's reconfigurable photonic quantum processor, where we observe a clear advantage in runtime and precision over the state of the art. We therefore establish the first scalable method for computing multi-photon indistinguishability, which applies naturally to current and near-term photonic quantum hardware.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical study of the light-induced shift of the coherent population trapping resonance. An analytical model is proposed that describes the interaction of two radiation components with an atomic system using a $Λ$ scheme and takes into account an additional level of excited state. Both weak and strong coupling regimes with off-resonant transitions are considered. It is shown that, in addition to the conventional dynamic Stark shift, an extra shift arises due to the distortion of the resonance line shape when bichromatic laser radiation interacts with off-resonant atomic transitions. An analytical expression for this additional shift is derived in the weak-coupling limit, and its significant impact on the resonance shape and sensitivity to the intensities of the laser field components is demonstrated. It is found that under strong coupling conditions, the additional shift can deviate substantially from a linear dependence on light intensity, suggesting new opportunities for controlling light shifts in precision atomic devices such as quantum frequency standards.

Abstract: The manipulation of distinct degrees of freedom of photons plays a critical role in both classical and quantum information processing. While the principles of wave optics provide elegant and scalable control over classical light in spatial and temporal domains, engineering quantum states in Fock space has been largely restricted to few-photon regimes, hindered by the computational and experimental challenges of large Hilbert spaces. Here, we introduce ``Fock-space optics", establishing a conceptual framework of wave propagation in the quantum domain by treating photon number as a synthetic dimension. Using a superconducting microwave resonator, we experimentally demonstrate Fock-space analogues of optical propagation, refraction, lensing, dispersion, and interference with up to 180 photons. These results establish a fundamental correspondence between Schrödinger evolution in a single bosonic mode and classical paraxial wave propagation. By mapping intuitive optical concepts onto high-dimensional quantum state engineering, our work opens a path toward scalable control of large-scale quantum systems with thousands of photons and advanced bosonic information processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum metrology, sensing, and device characterization are crucial for quantum technologies. Existing methods are limited by noise and scaling issues, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: The protocol uses single-qubit static fields with strengths independent of precision, avoiding multi-qubit operations which are error-prone.

Result: The protocol achieves Heisenberg-limited scaling and is robust against SPAM errors. Rigorous proof and numerical experiments support this.

Conclusion: This breakthrough provides new tools for quantum sensing and device characterization, overcoming previous limitations.

Abstract: Learning the Hamiltonian governing a quantum system is a central task in quantum metrology, sensing, and device characterization. Existing Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning protocols either require multi-qubit operations that are prone to noise, or single-qubit operations whose frequency or strength increases with the desired precision. These two requirements limit the applicability of Hamiltonian learning on near-term quantum platforms. We present a protocol that learns a quantum Hamiltonian with the optimal Heisenberg-limited scaling using only single-qubit control in the form of static fields with strengths that are independent of the target precision. Our protocol is robust against the state preparation and measurement (SPAM) error. By overcoming these limitations, our protocol provides new tools for device characterization and quantum sensing. We demonstrate that our method achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling through rigorous mathematical proof and numerical experiments. We also prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that a non-vanishing static field strength is necessary for achieving the Heisenberg limit unless one employs an extensive number of discrete control operations.

### [132] [Experimental Realization of Rabi-Driven Reset for Fast Cooling of a High-Q Cavity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10385)
*Eliya Blumenthal,Natan Karaev,Shay Hacohen-Gourgy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a hardware-efficient reset method for bosonic memories in quantum error correction, termed Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR). Through continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode, the method achieves significantly faster reset times compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research stems from the need for efficient error correction in quantum computing, which relies heavily on bosonic memories. The challenge of fast, high-fidelity reset operations is critical for reducing decoherence and latency in quantum systems.

Method: The Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) method is based on using a strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon qubit, combined with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes. These drives are detuned by the Rabi frequency, enabling the conversion of dispersive interactions into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling. This coupling mediates a tunable dissipation channel from the cavity mode to the cold readout bath, allowing for efficient and scalable reset operations.

Result: The implementation of RDR achieves a reset time of $1.2 μs$ for a single photon, which is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime of the photons. Additionally, the method successfully resets about 30 thermal photons within $80 μs$ to a steady-state average photon number of $ar{n} = 0.045 	ext{ ± 0.025}$.

Conclusion: The Rabi-Driven Reset method presented in this paper represents a significant advancement in the development of quantum error correction techniques. By enabling ultra-fast and robust reset operations, the method addresses one of the most critical challenges in quantum computing, paving the way for more reliable and scalable quantum information processing systems.

Abstract: High-Q bosonic memories are central to hardware-efficient quantum error correction, but their isolation makes fast, high-fidelity reset a persistent bottleneck. Existing approaches either rely on weak intermode cross-Kerr conversion or on measurement-based sequences with substantial latency. Here we demonstrate a hardware-efficient Rabi-Driven Reset (RDR) that implements continuous, measurement-free cooling of a superconducting cavity mode. A strong resonant Rabi drive on a transmon, together with sideband drives on the memory and readout modes detuned by the Rabi frequency, converts the dispersive interaction into an effective Jaynes-Cummings coupling between the qubit dressed states and each mode. This realizes a tunable dissipation channel from the memory to the cold readout bath. Crucially, the engineered coupling scales with the qubit-mode dispersive interaction and the drive amplitude, rather than with the intermode cross-Kerr, enabling fast cooling even in very weakly coupled architectures that deliberately suppress direct mode-mode coupling. We demonstrate RDR of a single photon with a decay time of $1.2 μs$, more than two orders of magnitude faster than the intrinsic lifetime. Furthermore, we reset about 30 thermal photons in about $80 μs$ to a steady-state average photon number of $\bar{n} = 0.045 \pm 0.025$.

Abstract: Calculating bounds of properties of many-body quantum systems is of paramount importance, since they guide our understanding of emergent quantum phenomena and complement the insights obtained from estimation methods. Recent semidefinite programming approaches enable probabilistic bounds from finite-shot measurements of easily accessible, yet informationally incomplete, observables. Here we render these methods scalable in the number of qubits by instead utilizing moment-matrix relaxations. After introducing the general formalism, we show how the approach can be adapted with specific knowledge of the system, such as it being the ground state of a given Hamiltonian, possessing specific symmetries or being the steady state of a given Lindbladian. Our approach defines a scalable real-world certification scheme leveraging semidefinite programming relaxations and experimental estimations which, unavoidably, contain shot noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The evolution of an isolated quantum system inevitably exhibits recurrence: the state returns to the vicinity of its initial condition after finite time. Despite its fundamental nature, a rigorous quantitative understanding of recurrence has been lacking. We establish upper bounds on the recurrence time, $t_{\mathrm{rec}} \lesssim t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)(1/ε)^d$, where $d$ is the Hilbert-space dimension, $ε$ the neighborhood size, and $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε)$ the escape time from this neighborhood. For pure states evolving under a Hamiltonian $H$, estimating $t_{\mathrm{exit}}$ is equivalent to an inverse quantum speed limit problem: finding upper bounds on the time a time-evolved state $ψ_t$ needs to depart from the $ε$-vicinity of the initial state $ψ_0$. We provide a partial solution, showing that under mild assumptions $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(ε) \approx ε/\sqrt{ Δ(H^2)}$, with $Δ(H^2)$ the Hamiltonian variance in $ψ_0$. We show that our upper bound on $t_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is generically saturated for random Hamiltonians. Finally, we analyze the impact of coherence of the initial state in the eigenbasis of $H$ on recurrence behavior.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Classical and quantum physics represent two distinct theories; however, quantum physics is regarded as the more fundamental of the two. It is posited that classical mechanics should arise from quantum mechanics under certain limiting conditions. Nevertheless, this remains a challenging objective. In this work, we explore the potential for unifying the dynamics of classical and quantum physics. This discussion does not suggest that classical behavior emerges from quantum mechanics; rather, it demonstrates the exact equivalence between the dynamics of quantum observables and their classical counterparts. It is shown that the Heisenberg equations of motion can be cast in a form that is identical to Newton's equations of motion, with $\hbar$ being absent from the formulation. This implies that both quantum and classical dynamics are governed by the same equations, with the Heisenberg operators substituting the classical observables.

TL;DR: The quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) were analyzed and found to be lower than the classical TUR bound under certain conditions, with the quantum corrections stemming from coherence playing a significant role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantum violations of the classical TUR and their implications for quantum thermodynamics is crucial for advancing quantum technologies.

Method: An effective classical Markov process was used to reproduce the steady-state currents and entropy production, while the quantum corrections were identified through an analysis of current fluctuations.

Result: The quantum thermodynamic uncertainty was found to decompose into classical and coherent contributions, with the latter becoming negative under resonant conditions and reaching its minimum at optimal coupling strength.

Conclusion: This work provides a deeper understanding of quantum thermodynamic effects and opens new avenues for optimizing quantum devices under the framework of the TUR.

Abstract: The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) imposes a fundamental constraint between current fluctuations and entropy production, providing a refined formulation of the second law for micro- and nanoscale systems. Quantum violations of the classical TUR reveal genuinely quantum thermodynamic effects, which are essential for improving performance and enabling optimization in quantum technologies. In this work, we analyze the TUR in a class of paradigmatic quantum thermal-machine models whose operation is enabled by coherent coupling between two energy levels forming a virtual qubit. Steady-state coherences are confined to this virtual-qubit subspace, while in the absence of coherent coupling the system satisfies detailed balance with the thermal reservoirs and supports no steady-state heat currents. We show that the steady-state currents and entropy production can be fully reproduced by an effective classical Markov process, whereas current fluctuations acquire an additional purely quantum correction originating from coherence. As a result, the thermodynamic uncertainty naturally decomposes into a classical (diagonal) contribution and a coherent contribution. The latter becomes negative under resonant conditions and reaches its minimum at the coupling strength that maximizes steady-state coherence. We further identify the optimization conditions and the criteria for surpassing the classical TUR bound in the vicinity of the reversible limit.

Abstract: We introduce SpinPulse, an open-source python package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level. SpinPulse models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise.

In SpinPulse, a quantum circuit is first transpiled into the native gate set of our model and then converted to a pulse sequence. This pulse sequence is subsequently integrated numerically in the presence of a simulated noisy experimental environment. We showcase workflows including transpilation, pulse-level compilation, hardware benchmarking, quantum error mitigation, and large-scale simulations via integration with the tensor-network library quimb. We expect SpinPulse to be a valuable open-source tool for the quantum computing community, fostering efforts to devise high-fidelity quantum circuits and improved strategies for quantum error mitigation and correction.

Conclusion: This approach provides a practical solution for designing reliable entangling gates in superconducting systems despite noise challenges.'

Abstract: We present a unified scheme for generating high-fidelity entangling gates in superconducting platforms by continuous dynamical decoupling (CDD) combined with variational minimal-energy optimal control. During the CDD stage, we suppress residual couplings, calibration drifting, and quasistatic noise, resulting in a stable effective Hamiltonian that preserves the designed ZZ interaction intended for producing tunable couplers. In this stable $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ manifold, we calculate smooth low-energy single-quibt control functions using a variational geodesic optimization process that directly minimizes gate infidelity. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to CZ, CX, and generic engangling gates, achieving virtually unit fidelity and robustness under restricted single-qubit action, with experimentally realistic control fields. These results establish CDD-enhanced variational geometric optimal control as a practical and noise-resilient scheme for designing superconducting entangling gates.

Abstract: We propose a generalization of the Filoche--Mayboroda localization landscape that extends the theory well beyond the static, elliptic and Hermitian settings while preserving its geometric interpretability. Using the positive operator $H^\dagger H$, we obtain a landscape that predicts localization across non-Hermitian, Floquet, and topological systems without computing eigenstates. Singular-value collapse reveals spectral instabilities and skin effects, the Sambe formulation captures coherent destruction of tunneling, and topological zero modes emerge directly from the landscape. Applications to Hatano--Nelson chains, driven two-level systems, and driven Aubry--André--Harper models confirm quantitative accuracy, establishing a unified predictor for localization in equilibrium and driven quantum matter.

Abstract: Fast and high fidelity shuttling of spin qubits has been demonstrated in semiconductor quantum dot devices. Several architectures based on shuttling have been proposed; it has been suggested that singlet-triplet (dual-spin) qubits could be optimal for the highest shuttling fidelities. Here we present a fault-tolerant framework for quantum error correction based on such dual-spin qubits, establishing them as a natural realisation of erasure qubits within semiconductor architectures. We introduce a hardware-efficient leakage-detection protocol that automatically projects leaked qubits back onto the computational subspace, without the need for measurement feedback or increased classical control overheads. When combined with the XZZX surface code and leakage-aware decoding, we demonstrate a twofold increase in the error correction threshold and achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in logical error rates. This establishes the singlet-triplet encoding as a practical route toward high-fidelity shuttling and erasure-based, fault-tolerant quantum computation in semiconductor devices.

Abstract: Quantum Amplitude Amplification (QAA), the generalization of Grover's algorithm, is capable of yielding optimal solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with high probabilities. In this work we extend the conventional 2-dimensional representation of Grover's (orthogonal collective states) to oracles which encode cost functions such as QUBO, and show that linear cost functions are a special case whereby an exact formula exists for determining optimal oracle parameter settings. Using simulations of problem sizes up to 40 qubits we demonstrate QAA's algorithmic performance across all possible solutions, with an emphasis on the closeness in Grover-like performance for solutions near the global optimum. We conclude with experimental demonstrations of generalized QAA on both IBMQ (superconducting) and IonQ (trapped ion) qubits, showing that the observed probabilities of each basis state match our equations as a function of varying the free parameters in the oracle and diffusion operators.

### [143] [H-EFT-VA: An Effective-Field-Theory Variational Ansatz with Provable Barren Plateau Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10479)
*Eyad I. B Hamid*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The H-EFT-VA architecture introduced in this paper mitigates the Barren Plateau (BP) issue in variational quantum algorithms by maintaining sufficient expressibility and entanglement, leading to a significant improvement in optimization convergence and ground-state fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Barren Plateau issue poses a significant threat to the scalability and effectiveness of variational quantum algorithms. This paper aims to develop a robust architecture that circumvents this problem while maintaining the expressibility required for complex quantum states.

Method: The H-EFT-VA architecture is inspired by Effective Field Theory and introduces a hierarchical 'UV-cutoff' during the initialization process. This method theoretically restricts the circuit's state space to prevent the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs, thereby avoiding the BP phenomenon.

Result: The benchmarking results demonstrate a substantial improvement in the QCs' performance on quantum models including the Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models. Specifically, the energy convergence is improved by 109×, and the ground-state fidelity increases by a factor of 10.7×, with a statistical significance of p < 1e-88.

Conclusion: The H-EFT-VA architecture successfully addresses the Barren Plateau problem while preserving the necessary physical properties for accurate and efficient quantum computations, marking a significant advancement in the design of variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are critically threatened by the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. In this work, we introduce the H-EFT Variational Ansatz (H-EFT-VA), an architecture inspired by Effective Field Theory (EFT). By enforcing a hierarchical "UV-cutoff" on initialization, we theoretically restrict the circuit's state exploration, preventing the formation of approximate unitary 2-designs. We provide a rigorous proof that this localization guarantees an inverse-polynomial lower bound on the gradient variance: $Var[\partial θ] \in Ω(1/poly(N))$. Crucially, unlike approaches that avoid BPs by limiting entanglement, we demonstrate that H-EFT-VA maintains volume-law entanglement and near-Haar purity, ensuring sufficient expressibility for complex quantum states. Extensive benchmarking across 16 experiments -- including Transverse Field Ising and Heisenberg XXZ models -- confirms a 109x improvement in energy convergence and a 10.7x increase in ground-state fidelity over standard Hardware-Efficient Ansatze (HEA), with a statistical significance of $p < 10^{-88}$.

Abstract: Neutral atom quantum processors have emerged as a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, offering high-fidelity operations and exceptional qubit scalability. A key challenge in realizing practical applications is efficiently extracting readout outcomes while maintaining high system throughput, i.e., the rate of quantum task executions. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the trade-off between readout fidelity and atomic retention. Moreover, we introduce a metric of quantum circuit iteration rate (qCIR) and employ normalized quantum Fisher information to characterize system overall performance. Further, by carefully balancing fidelity and retention, we demonstrate a readout strategy for optimizing information acquisition efficiency. Considering the experimentally feasible parameters for 87Rb atoms, we demonstrate that qCIRs of 197.2Hz and 154.5Hz are achievable using single photon detectors and cameras, respectively. These results provide practical guidance for constructing scalable and high-throughput neutral atom quantum processors for applications in sensing, simulation, and near-term algorithm implementation.

Abstract: We study the computation of the $α$-Rényi capacity of a classical-quantum (c-q) channel for $α\in(0,1)$. We propose an exponentiated-gradient (mirror descent) iteration that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our analysis establishes relative smoothness with respect to the entropy geometry, guaranteeing a global sublinear convergence of the objective values. Furthermore, under a natural tangent-space nondegeneracy condition (and a mild spectral lower bound in one regime), we prove local linear (geometric) convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on a truncated probability simplex, with an explicit contraction factor once the local curvature constants are bounded.

Abstract: The scalable and deterministic preparation of large Fock-number states represents a long-standing frontier in quantum science, with direct implications for quantum metrology, communication, and simulation. Despite significant progress in small-scale implementations, extending such state generation to large excitation numbers while maintaining high fidelity remains a formidable challenge. Here, we present a scalable protocol for generating large Fock states with fidelities exceeding 0.9 up to photon numbers on the order of 100, achieved using only native control operations and, when desired, further enhanced by an optional post-selection step. Our method employs a hybrid Genetic-Adam optimization framework that combines the global search efficiency of genetic algorithms with the adaptive convergence of Adam to optimize multi-pulse control sequences comprising Jaynes-Cummings interactions and displacement operations, both of which are native to leading experimental platforms. The resulting control protocols achieve high fidelities with shallow circuit depths and strong robustness against parameter variations. These results establish an efficient and scalable pathway toward high-fidelity non-classical state generation for precision metrology and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.

Abstract: Whether neural information processing is entirely classical or involves quantum-mechanical elements remains an open question. Here we propose a model-agnostic, information-theoretic test of nonclassicality that bypasses microscopic assumptions and instead probes the structure of neural representations themselves. Using autoencoders as a transparent model system, we introduce a Bell-type consistency test in latent space, and ask whether decoding statistics obtained under multiple readout contexts can be jointly explained by a single positive latent-variable distribution. By shifting the search for quantum-like signatures in neural systems from microscopic dynamics to experimentally testable constraints on information processing, this work opens a new route for probing the fundamental physics of neural computation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMFT applications, using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) to prepare the ground state of the AIM with shallow quantum circuits. The solver uses a unified ansatz framework to prepare the particle and hole excitations of the ground-state from parameter-shifted circuits, enabling the reconstruction of the impurity Green's function through a continued-fraction expansion. We evaluate the performance of this approach across a few bath sizes and interaction strengths under noisy, shot-limited conditions. We compare three optimization routines (COBYLA, Adam, and L-BFGS-B) in terms of convergence and fidelity, assess the benefits of estimating a quantum-computed moment (QCM) correction to the variational energies, and benchmark the approach by comparing the reconstructed density of states (DOS) against that obtained using a classical pipeline. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of Green's function reconstruction on near-term devices and establish practical benchmarks for quantum impurity solvers embedded within self-consistent DMFT loops.

TL;DR: It's hard to get from start to finish in quantum search if they're at right angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People care about quantum search and how reliably it works.

Method: Math with Hilbert spaces and stuff.

Result: If you have orthogonal start and finish states, it's not easy and sometimes impossible to do it optimally with constant Hamiltonians.

Conclusion: Quantum search struggles when start and finish are orthogonal, and the problem is this symmetry thing.

Abstract: It is known that the continuous-time variant of Grover's search algorithm is characterized by quantum search frameworks that are governed by stationary Hamiltonians, which result in search trajectories confined to the two-dimensional subspace of the complete Hilbert space formed by the source and target states. Specifically, the search approach is ineffective when the source and target states are orthogonal. In this paper, we employ normalization, orthogonality, and energy limitations to demonstrate that it is unfeasible to breach time-optimality between orthogonal states with constant Hamiltonians when the evolution is limited to the two-dimensional space spanned by the initial and final states. Deviations from time-optimality for unitary evolutions between orthogonal states can only occur with time-dependent Hamiltonian evolutions or, alternatively, with constant Hamiltonian evolutions in higher-dimensional subspaces of the entire Hilbert space. Ultimately, we employ our quantitative analysis to provide meaningful insights regarding the relationship between time-optimal evolutions and analog quantum search methods. We determine that the challenge of transitioning between orthogonal states with a constant Hamiltonian in a sub-optimal time is closely linked to the shortcomings of analog quantum search when the source and target states are orthogonal and not interconnected by the search Hamiltonian. In both scenarios, the fundamental cause of the failure lies in the existence of an inherent symmetry within the system.

Abstract: We examine the pertinent geometric characteristics of entanglement that arise from stationary Hamiltonian evolutions transitioning from separable to maximally entangled two-qubit quantum states. From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions are quantified using various metrics, such as concurrence, entanglement power, and entangling capability. Overall, our findings indicate that time-optimal evolution trajectories are marked by high geodesic efficiency, with no energy resource wastage, no curvature (i.e., zero bending), and an average path entanglement that is less than that observed in time-suboptimal evolutions. Additionally, when analyzing separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions between nonorthogonal states, time-optimal evolutions demonstrate a greater short-time degree of nonlocality compared to time-suboptimal evolutions between the same initial and final states. Interestingly, the reverse is generally true for separable-to-maximally entangled evolutions involving orthogonal states. Our investigation suggests that this phenomenon arises because suboptimal trajectories between orthogonal states are characterized by longer path lengths with smaller curvature, which are traversed with a higher energy resource wastage compared to suboptimal trajectories between nonorthogonal states. Consequently, a higher initial degree of nonlocality in the unitary time propagators appears to be essential for achieving the maximally entangled state from a separable state. Furthermore, when assessing optimal and suboptimal evolutions...

TL;DR: This paper explores the curvature of quantum evolution for a two-level system under time-dependent magnetic fields, establishing how curvature relates to efficiency, complexity, and geodesy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum evolution's geometry helps in optimizing quantum computing and control, especially for efficient and less complex processes.

Method: Used analytical math with a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian, derived an exact curvature expression, and analyzed its implications.

Result: Curvature impacts complexity, with efficient paths being less complex; however, longer, curved paths can have lower complexity than shorter, straight ones.

Conclusion: Curvature significantly affects both efficiency and complexity in quantum evolution, suggesting that trade-offs exist between path length, curvature, and system complexity.

Abstract: In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can take place along paths of minimal length within an optimal time frame. Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero curvature, and a high level of complexity. In this paper, we provide an exact analytical expression for the curvature of a quantum evolution pertaining to a two-level quantum system subjected to various time-dependent magnetic fields. Specifically, we examine the dynamics produced by a two-parameter nonstationary Hermitian Hamiltonian with unit speed efficiency. To enhance our understanding of the physical implications of the curvature coefficient, we analyze the curvature behavior in relation to geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and the complexity of the quantum evolution (as described by the ratio of the difference between accessible and accessed Bloch-sphere volumes for the evolution from initial to final state to the accessible volume for the given quantum evolution). Our findings indicate that, generally, efficient quantum evolutions exhibit lower complexity compared to inefficient ones. However, we also note that complexity transcends mere length. In fact, longer paths that are sufficiently curved can demonstrate a complexity that is less than that of shorter paths with a lower curvature coefficient.

Conclusion: 这项研究提出了量子信道恢复查询复杂性的重要理论界限，特别是在高维和多参数约束的情况下，为量子信息处理和通信系统的设计提供了理论依据和参考。

Abstract: Consider quantum channels with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. Any such channel must satisfy the constraint $rd_2\geq d_1$, and the parameter regime $rd_2=d_1$ is called the boundary regime. In this paper, we show an optimal query lower bound $Ω(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ for quantum channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$ in the away-from-boundary regime $rd_2\geq 2d_1$, matching the existing upper bound $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$. In particular, this lower bound fully settles the query complexity for the commonly studied case of equal input and output dimensions $d_1=d_2=d$ with $r\geq 2$, in sharp contrast to the unitary case $r=1$ where Heisenberg scaling $Θ(d^2/\varepsilon)$ is achievable.

Method: We moved beyond standard circuit models using global interactions (e.g., neutral atoms, trapped ions), utilizing CZ gates, and quantum FAN-OUT.

Result:  Constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation, overcoming the logarithmic-depth barrier, using polynomial ancillae and additional gates.

Conclusion:  Advances in quantum circuit design and understanding of quantum complexity.

Abstract: Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the logarithmic-depth barrier by moving beyond the standard circuit model and leveraging global interactions (native to architectures such as neutral atoms and trapped ions). Specifically, utilizing unbounded CZ gates (i.e. within the QAC$^0$ circuit class), we offer circuits for exact computation of constant-weight Dicke states, using polynomial ancillae, and approximation of weight-1 Dicke states (i.e. $W$ states), using only constant ancillae. Granted additional access to the quantum FAN-OUT operation (i.e. upgrading to the QAC$_f^0$ circuit class), we also achieve exact preparation of arbitrary-weight Dicke states, with polynomial ancillae. These protocols distinguish the constant-depth capabilities of quantum architectures based on connectivity and offer a novel path toward resolving a long-standing quantum complexity conjecture.

Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current and whose contribution was overlooked in the past. The distinction between different force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the current shift in the spin Hall effect and the correlation-induced quantum torques. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.

We provide theoretical guarantees on asymptotic performance and demonstrate strong performance on bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes.

The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.
