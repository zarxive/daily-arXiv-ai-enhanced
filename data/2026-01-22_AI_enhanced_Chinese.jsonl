It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate.

The system consists of a Cherenkov radiator layer separated from a photosensitive surface equipped with SiPMs by an expansion gap. A thin glass slab, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is coupled to the SiPMs to perform Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pixel pitches ranging from 2 to 3 mm and coupled with 1 mm thick fused silica window. The RICH radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. We measured a single-hit angular resolution of about 4 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value and a time resolution better than 50 ps RMS for charged particles with Z = 1. The present technology makes the proposed SiPM-based PID system particularly attractive for space applications due to the limited detector volumes available.

With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms.", "AI": {"tldr": "The transfer-matrix method is reliable for low-atom density in 1D optical lattices but fails beyond a certain density due to collective atomic responses.

As epithelial cells tightly adhere together to form the confluent tissue, the distribution of cell areas significantly influences possible patterns of cellular packing and thereby also the mechanics of the epithelium. Therefore, it is important to understand the origin of cell area heterogeneity in developing tissues and, if possible, how to control it. Previous models of cell growth and division have been successful in accounting for experimentally observed area distributions in cultured cells and bacterial colonies, but developing tissues present additional complexity due to self-organized patterns of mechanical stresses that guide morphogenesis. Here, we address this challenge focusing on the D. melanogaster wing disc epithelium. We consider a simple model that couples cell cycle dynamics to tissue mechanics. From time-lapse imaging of the cellular network, we extract all model parameters - cell growth rates, division rates, and mechanical fluctuations - revealing that they all depend on cell size. With these independently measured parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed cell area distribution without any fitting parameters and further predicts tissue pressure gradients, in quantitative agreement with previously published data. Importantly, we find that cell proliferation accounts for 85% of cell area variance, establishing it as the dominant source of packing disorder that influences tissue mechanics and organization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

When the superconductors are deposited on the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator, this pattern is slightly modified due to the presence of chiral Majorana modes. Here we calculate the critical current of a Corbino Josephson junction, where the fluxoid becomes quantized and the superconducting phase has an integer winding. We discover that circular junctions exhibit similar behavior in both topologically trivial and non-trivial scenarios, while non-circular junctions demonstrate a remarkable distinction. Using a simple analytical model, we show that these non-circular junctions exhibit reentrant superconductivity with a period related to their number of corners, and numerically we find that this period is halved in the topological case. The period halving may help establish the existence of topological superconductivity in hybrid topological insulator-superconductor junctions.", "AI": {"tldr":

Accurately determining the backbone curve of resonance peaks is pivotal for the design of friction devices. However, the prediction of these curves is computationally challenging owing to the nonconservative and nonsmooth nature of friction nonlinearity. Although techniques such as damped nonlinear normal modes (dNNMs) and phase resonance methods have been applied, they often suffer from convergence issues, and their computational accuracy is compromised under certain conditions. This study proposes a novel method for computing the forced response backbone curves of structures with frictional contact interfaces. The method accurately tracks the backbone curve through a parameter continuation scheme, formulated via Lagrange multipliers and accelerated by incorporating a derived analytical Hessian Tensor of contact elements. This approach yields highly accurate numerical results and enables numerical singularities on the curve to be identified and robustly traversed. The proposed method is validated using an Euler-Bernoulli beam finite-element model and a lumped-parameter blade-damper-blade model. The results demonstrate superior accuracy compared to conventional dNNMs and phase resonance methods, particularly in cases involving either high structural damping or strong frictional damping. This work provides a robust computational tool and presents a detailed comparative analysis that clarifies the applicability and limitations of the proposed and conventional methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6848\u8ba1\u7b97\u542b\u6469\u64e6\u63a5\u89e6 interface\u7684\u7ed3\u6784 Forced\u54cd\u5e94 backbone\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e58\u6570\u548c\u89e3\u6790Hessian\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6881\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f6c\u5b50-\u963b\u5c3c\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53d7\u8feb\u632f\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u6790\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u5177\u6709\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684resonance peak backbone\u66f2\u7ebf\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6469\u64e6\u88c5\u7f6e\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u7684\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u53ca\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982dNNMs\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5171\u632f\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u6240\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6613\u53d7\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u56f0\u6270\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u6240\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e58\u6570\u548c\u89e3\u6790Hessian\u5f20\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684 backbone\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5947\u70b9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6881\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f6c\u5b50-\u963b\u5c3c\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684dNNMs\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u5171\u632f\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u963b\u5c3c\u6216\u5f3a\u6469\u64e6\u963b\u5c3c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u4e58\u6570\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u89e3\u6790Hessian\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u975e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d7\u8feb\u54cd\u5e94 backbone\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5947\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Motivated by this confluence, we investigate an interacting fermion--boson system formed by coupling an exciton to a quasihole of a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) at filling fraction $1/3$. We introduce a kagome--lattice fermion--boson model hosting an electronic FCI and a mobile exciton whose dispersion is tunable from a parabolic band to a flatband. Using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate the emergence of exciton--quasihole bound states controlled by the repulsive electron--exciton interaction $V_{\\mathrm{FB}}$ and the exciton kinetic energy $t_{\\mathrm{B}}$. These states appear as low--lying levels in the fermion--boson spectrum, well separated from the scattering continuum, and arise despite repulsive interactions due to a residual attraction to the local charge depletion associated with a quasihole. Reducing $t_{\\mathrm{B}}$ enhances this effect by favoring interaction--dominated binding. Our results provide a model description of moir\u00e9 TMD heterostructures, including fractional Chern insulating twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ proximitized by excitonic TMD heterobilayers, where we estimate exciton--quasihole binding energy scales of $0.6$--$1.1$~meV, placing these effects within reach of photoluminescence spectroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86TMDs\u4e0eFCI\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684Exciton-Quasihole\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "TMDs\u548cFCI\u5747\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e8c\u8005\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5728kagome\u683c\u70b9\u4e2d\u7684Fermion-Boson\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Exciton-Quasihole\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5f53Exciton\u7684\u8272\u6563\u53ef\u8c03\u81f3\u629b\u7269\u9762\u6216\u5e73\u5766\u9762\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Attractive\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f62\u6210\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u6563\u5c04\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u6001\u3002\u964d\u4f4eExciton\u7684\u8272\u6563\u80fd\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u4f30\u8ba1\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u57280.6-1.1 meV\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u83ab\u5c14TMD\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5149oluminescence\u5149\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76Fermion-Boson\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86Exciton-Quasihole\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u80fd\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u3002"}}

Traditional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are typically simulated by constructing asymmetric couplings or by introducing dissipation and gain to realize non-Hermitian systems. The quadratic bosonic system (QBS) with squeezing interaction is intrinsically Hermitian; however, its dynamical evolution matrix in both real and momentum spaces is non-Hermitian. Based on this, applying a field-operator transformation xp to the dynamical evolution matrix yields quadrature nonreciprocal transmission between the x and p operators. This nonreciprocal characteristic can be utilized in signal amplifiers. On the other hand, within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework in momentum space, one can observe non-Hermitian topological phenomena such as point-gap topology and the non-Hermitian skin effect, both induced by spectra with nonzero winding numbers. Additionally, QBS can be employed to realize non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm cages and to extend non-Bloch band theory. Previous studies in non-Hermitian physics have largely concentrated on classical systems. The influence of non-Hermitian properties on quantum effects remains a key issue awaiting exploration and has evolved into a research direction at the interface of non-Hermitian and quantum physics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\uff1a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8026\u5408\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u635f\u8017\u4e0e\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4e8c\u6b21\u6b63\u5219\u632f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08QBS\uff09\u5e26\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u8eab\u4e3a\u5384\u5bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e3a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u7b97\u7b26\u53d8\u6362xp\u4f5c\u7528\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97x\u548cp\u7b97\u7b26\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e0d\u4e92\u6613\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e8c\u6b21\u975e\u4e92\u6613\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u653e\u5927\u5668\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6ce1\u5229-\u5fb7\u76d6\u65af\u7eb3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5982\u70b9\u95f4\u9699\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5747\u6e90\u81ea\u975e\u96f6\u7ed5\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cQBS\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u5b89\u5fb7erson-\u9c8d\u5c14 swapping\u7b3c\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u975e\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u80fd\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u8fd0\u7528\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u54c8\u5bc6\u987fians\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u573a\u7b97\u7b26\u53d8\u6362\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce1\u5229-\u5fb7\u76d6\u65af\u7eb3\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6548\u5e94\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u5b89\u5fb7erson-\u9c8d\u5c14\u7b3c\u548c\u975e\u5e03\u6d1b\u8d6b\u80fd\u5e26\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u653e\u5927\u5668\u3001\u975e\u4e92\u62d3\u6251\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u91cd\u70b9\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5176\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5e94\u7528\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Further increasing the total bandwidth with copper interconnects is challenging, thus it is crucial to introduce optics into the scale-up network. For this purpose, the most important metrics are the energy efficiency of the total link in addition to the spatial bandwidth-density and reach. With the inefficiency of copper traces at high speeds, transitioning to co-packaged optics is no longer optional but essential. Here, we show that the mature VCSEL technology offers the ideal combination of low-cost, low-latency, high-reliability, and energy efficiency at all bitrates, thanks to their unique versatility and high wall-plug-efficiency.

First we give the general form of this integral when $\u03c9_1/\u03c9_2$ is irrational and then we consider the case of commensurable frequencies. In particular we study the integrals for the resonances $\u03c9_1/\u03c9_2=4/1, 5/1, 3/2, 4/3, 3/1$ and $2/1$. We also calculate the invariant curves and the orbits in the cases $\u03c9_1/\u03c9_2=2/1$ and $1/1$ (with $\u03b2=\u03b3=0$) and we compare the exact-numerical and the theoretical results predicted by the formal integral when $\u03b2\u03b3\\neq0$.

Here we present an alternative approach that does not use this equation, and does not a-priori assume that the function is quadratic in concentration, $c$. Still, the quadratic dependence on concentration is also found. We analyze a gas consisting of argon at temperatures between 200 and 700 K. From the numerical calculations, we derive that the attraction parameter depends on temperature according to a -1/6 power scaling, and thus the attraction component to the second virial coefficient, $B_2$, scales with a -7/6 power to temperature.

Hodgkin and Huxley introduced voltage-dependent conductances controlled by gating variables. While these equations reproduce experimental observations, they were derived through curve-fitting without theoretical justification. Modern theoretical physics derives governing equations from symmetry principles through Lie group theory. We prove that the complete Hodgkin-Huxley equations necessarily follow from three fundamental symmetries: (1) compact conformational state spaces, (2) multiplicative conductance scaling, and (3) temporal translation invariance. These symmetries uniquely determine a Lie group structure isomorphic to SO(2) semidirect product with R2. From representation theory, we derive: boundedness from SO(2) compactness, exponential Boltzmann factors from scale invariance, specific integer exponents m3h and n4 from irreducible representations, and first-order kinetics from Lie algebra flows. This demonstrates that the HH equations are not empirical curve-fits but the unique mathematical structure mandated by fundamental symmetries. We reveal why gating variables must be bounded, voltage dependencies must be exponential, sodium requires three activation gates and one inactivation gate, potassium requires four activation gates, and kinetics must be first-order. This establishes that neural electrophysiology obeys the same theoretical framework as modern physics, where symmetries determine dynamics, providing a foundation for understanding channel mutations and network dynamics through group theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities.

Finally, we introduce the idea that this resonance delineates a continuous passage from a \"classical\" phase to a \"quantum\" phase for a binary system, such as the three-dimensional Ising model, which belongs to the same universality class as a fermion-antifermion system or, more generally, a matter-antimatter system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u7684\u5206\u754c\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u754c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5\u4e09\u7ef4Ising\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u78c1\u6ede\u533a\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u7c92\u5b50\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u78c1\u6ede\u533a\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u67d0\u4e00\u7279\u5b9a\u6e29\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u6781\u5927\u503c\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u76f8\u53d8\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u632f\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7c92\u5b50\uff08\u5982\u6807\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u6216\u5b64\u7acb\u5b50\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3Ising\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76f8\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u76f8\u7684\u5206\u754c\u7ebf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Using ab initio calculations, we show that monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ has short-range antiferromagnetic correlations among Nb$_3$ trimers with S = 1/2, and becomes magnetically frustrated due to the underlying effective triangular lattice geometry, and is evidenced by a frustration index of f > 1. The high-temperature susceptibility shows a negative Weiss temperature from Monte Carlo calculations. Considering spin-orbit coupling, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy, including anisotropic exchange, single-ion anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using the four-state energy mapping formalism.

Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with R\u00e9nyi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Fokker-Planck generalization of the transport-of-intensity equation", "comment": "36 pages, 8 figures, paper to be submitted to Physical Review A", "summary": "The transport-of-intensity equation (TIE) has been very widely employed for phase retrieval. In particular, the TIE is an elliptic second-order partial differential equation which may be solved for the phase of a coherent paraxial field such as a monochromatic scalar optical beam, given the intensity and longitudinal intensity derivative in a plane perpendicular to the optical axis. We show how the coherent flow associated with the TIE may be augmented by a diffusive flow associated with a scalar or tensor diffusion field. Such diffusive flow can arise via scattering from unresolved spatially random microstructure within an illuminated sample, the blurring effects of an extended chaotic source that illuminates the sample, the resolution-reducing effect of shot noise in detected intensity images of the sample, and the sharpening effect (negative diffusion) associated with scattering from sharp sample edges. Augmenting the TIE's modeling of coherent flow with a diffuse-flow channel leads to a Fokker-Planck extension to this equation. Two different TIE augmentations are obtained, using three different derivations. The inverse problems of phase retrieval and diffusion-field retrieval are then studied, for both defocus-based imaging and mask-based imaging (structured-illumination imaging). When symmetric overfocus and underfocus images are employed for the purposes of phase retrieval, the diffusive term drops out and our Fokker-Planck formalism implies that any ensuing TIE-based phase-retrieval method needs no modification in light of our formalism. However, the same focal-series dataset -- which is typically an infocus image, a weakly overfocused image, and a weakly underfocused image -- may also be employed to access the additional channel of information associated with the Fokker-Planck diffusion field. Our formalism is applicable to visible light, x-rays, electrons, and neutrons.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior.

These two formalisms are apparently incompatible, leading to difficulties in understanding atomic dynamics in intermediate matter. In this work, we demonstrate that normal modes, often synonymously considered as phonons in solids, provide a microscopic description of various transport processes, including thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity, in a prototypical dilute gas, argon. Our results reveal that normal modes constitute elementary excitations in dilute gases, extending their physical relevance far beyond vibrational excitations in solids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u6c14\u4f53\u548c\u56fa\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df", "result": "\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u6fc0\u53d1\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u6c14\u4f53\u4e2d", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5bf9\u539f\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u89e3"}}

Working in the Orlik-Solomon algebra on a De Concini-Procesi wonderful model, we restrict to the S3 x S3 invariant subspace and impose factorization boundary-by-boundary. The intersection of ten compatible 3|3 channels with two compatible 2-particle channels collapses to a unique one-dimensional candidate line.

Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $\u03c9$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $\u03c9_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $\u03c9_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Under external pressure, this order is suppressed and a superconducting phase emerges. This phase diagram, which closely resembles that of high-$T_c$ superconductors, together with a kagome flat band near the Fermi level and possible altermagnetic order, has motivated extensive theoretical and experimental investigations. To better understand how pressure influences the ordered states, we present a systematic study of the evolution of the electronic properties under applied pressure. Performing DFT+DMFT (density functional theory combined with dynamical mean field theory) calculations, we uncover a complex interplay between the redistribution of spectral weight in the flat bands and the strength of electronic correlations under pressure. Our results further strengthen the interpretation that pressure effectively weakens electronic correlations through enhanced orbital hybridization.

Benchmarking ITPP on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model demonstrates that truncation provides a controlled trade-off between accuracy and computational cost, while also revealing challenges associated with operator growth under imaginary time evolution. Finally, combining imaginary time and real-time Pauli Propagation naturally suggests a pathway toward simulating open quantum system dynamics within a unified framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Pauli Propagation\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Illuminated Time Pauli Propagation\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Pauli\u4e32\u751f\u6210\u7684\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728Pauli\u57fa\u5e95\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u72b6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301Pauli\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Pauli\u4f20\u64ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Illuminated Time Pauli Propagation\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Illuminated Time Pauli Propagation\uff08ITPP\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfcPauli\u7b97\u7b26\u5728\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728Pauli\u57fa\u5e95\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u57281D\u6a2a\u573aIsing\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cITPP\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u64cd\u4f5c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cIlluminated Time Pauli Propagation\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4Pauli\u4f20\u64ad\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cITPP\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u589e\u957f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u865a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In principle, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) can detect the Fermi level, and its dependence on gate bias as well as position, potentially directly yielding band gaps, contact barriers, spatial nonuniformities, and sub-gap densities of states in such devices. However, KPFM relies on an oscillating probe voltage which itself electrostatically dopes the 2DSC, potentially creating a nonlinear response. Here, we show that when a suitably thin hBN back-gate dielectric is used, the KPFM signal agrees well with expectations, as explained by a quasistatic charge-balance model.

The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation.

Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u534f\u53d8\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u5c06\u725b\u987f\u76f4\u89c9\u5916\u63a8\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba regime\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u65af\u548c\u51efr\u00fcck\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u843d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf E\u3001\u5177\u4f53\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf L \u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb a \u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d Kerr \u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u65af\u65f6\u7a7a\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u534a\u5f84\u4e0b\u662f\u66f4\u5f3a\u8fd8\u662f\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5f84\u5411\u5438\u5165\u533a\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u529b focusing \u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5b8c\u6574\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u51cf\u5c11\u5f15\u529b\u805a\u7126\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5728 1+3 \u534f\u53d8\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u526a\u5207\u548c\u62c9\u9a6c\u52aa\u91d1\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65f6-like \u540c\u4f59\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u65e0\u7a77 rotational \u6d41\u7684\u526a\u5207\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u526a\u5207\u8c03\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u805a\u7126\u901f\u7387\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5bf9\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u5438\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u524a\u5f31\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bd5\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u584c\u7f29\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u534f\u53d8\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u65af\u548c\u51ef\u00fcck\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u4e0b\u843d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u533a\u5206\u5177\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u5177\u4f53\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u65e0\u7a77 rotational \u6d41\u7684\u526a\u5207\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u526a\u5207\u8c03\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u603b\u4f53\u805a\u7126\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u584c\u7f29\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u524a\u5f31\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5f15\u529b\u584c\u7f29\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

In Kitaev's paradigmatic honeycomb model a spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ fractionalizes into $Z_2$ flux due to emergent $Z_2$ gauge field and matter Majorana fermions. Although these excitations have well-defined dynamics in the integrable limit, their direct experimental identification is notoriously challenging: realistic materials inevitably host additional symmetry-allowed interactions that break integrability and hybridize gauge and matter sectors, while magnetic fields, which are often required to suppress competing order and stabilize a putative QSL regime, further entangle the responses of different fractionalized quasiparticles and may even drive the system into field-induced spin-liquid phases that are not adiabatically connected to the integrable limit. A prominent example is the quantum Majorana metal, in which the distinct dynamics of fractionalized Majorana fermions can become directly visible in scattering. This report highlights recent progress on these related questions: in which field-stabilized QSL regimes and nearby emergent phases, and under what conditions, can the response of a specific fractionalized quasiparticle be isolated and positively understood, thereby clarifying the existence and the experimental scope of putative spin liquids? We review the progress on these questions across Abelian, non-Abelian, and an emergent quantum phases under magnetic field that are not perturbatively connected to the integrable limit. We connect these field-induced dynamical phenomena to concrete experimental observables, relevant for neutron scattering, resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, and pump-probe spectroscopy that are capable of resolving specific types of fractionalized particles, including Majoranas and $Z_2$ fluxes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u65b0\u5174\u76f8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\uff08QSLs\uff09\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u5982Majorana\u548cZ\u2082\u901a\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fMajorana\u548cZ\u2082\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u501f\u52a9\u4e2d\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u3001\u5171\u632f\u4e2d\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u6cf5\u63a2\u9488\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u78c1\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u548c\u8fd1\u90bb\u76f8\u4e2d\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5982Majorana\u548cZ\u2082\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u548c\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u76f8\u4e4b\u95f4\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u5316\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks. Our results show that black hole charge can significantly modify photon trajectories and polarization patterns: increasing charge compresses and distorts the EVPA structure on photon-ring scales, inducing localized rotations and asymmetries that may provide a potential diagnostic of a nonzero black hole charge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u5361\u9f50\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6781\u5316\u8f90\u5c04\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u8377\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5149\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6781\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u5316\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7535\u8377\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Walk-Penrose\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbODE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u6781\u5316\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7535\u8377\u6539\u53d8\u5149\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u6781\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u8377\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u5bf9\u6781\u5316\u8f90\u5c04\u6210\u50cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7535\u8377\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We show that the frequently employed Fu-Kane effective theory breaks down in this case. As parameters like the chemical potential or the width of the junction are tuned, instances of vanishing effective velocity mark the emergence of additional 'Dirac cones' at zero energy and finite momentum. If the junction is subjected to an external magnetic field, Josephson vortices may then bind a number of zero modes in addition to the topological Majorana mode. The additional zero modes are 'symmetry-protected' and can be lifted by a broken mirror symmetry (which is to be expected in realistic scenarios) as well as by an in-plane magnetization (or Zeeman field).

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase.

By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Halide perovskite nanoparticles have great potential as single photon emitters with high quantum efficiency.

A previous experiment on a CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposite film suggested possibility that electron beam irradiation can be used to control positions of CsPbBr3 nano-light sources in the Cs4PbBr6 host although the effects of electron beam irradiation are not fully understood. Here, we fabricate a Cs4PbBr6-CsBr film, not containing the CsPbBr3 phase, and provide direct evidence that CsPbBr3 nanoparticles can be locally generated in the Cs4PbBr6 host by irradiation with a focused electron beam.

In rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a strong trigonal warping effect gives rise to a semi-metallic state near the Fermi surface, offering unique opportunities to explore the interplay of semi-metallic properties with strong correlations and topologies. Here, the observation of quarter semimetals in rhombohedral multilayer graphene by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is reported. The semi-metallic characteristics of rhombohedral graphene manifest as nearly vanished Hall resistance and parabolic longitudinal resistance. The strong correlations arising from the surface flat band lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking. SOC proximitized by WSe2 further lifts the valley degeneracy, resulting in the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, as evidenced by the hysteretic anomalous Hall effect. The coexistence of fully polarized electrons and holes allows for the observation of a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall resistance. Furthermore, the application of moderate magnetic fields induces a phase transition from quarter semimetals to Chern insulators.

It is also known to be isomorphic to an {\\it annealed} binary-alloy disorder model. Notwithstanding extensive numerical studies for the FKM, analytic insight into the microscopic processes spawning novel Mott-like quantum criticality is scarce. Here, we develop a fully analytic theory for the Mott-like quantum criticality in the FKM on a hierarchical Cayley tree (Bethe lattice) by utilizing a single input from a 2-site cluster-dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). We find that density fluctuation modes acquire anomalous dimensions, originating from infra-red power-law singular cluster self-energies.

In practice, however, the physical quantity is a ray (a rank-one projector), so each input specifies only a projector and leaves a gauge freedom in the phases of its vector representatives. This becomes a real operational barrier when one asks for a device that, given two independently prepared unknown pure states, outputs a coherent state proportional to a prescribed linear combination. We identify the missing ingredient as not probabilistic but phase-like. One needs a physical scenario that fixes a single phase convention on the relevant set of rays, so that the overlaps become well defined complex numbers. Thus, we formalize this through phase conventions and a single notion -- dubbed as \"overlap-determinability.\" Our main theorem gives an exact equivalence: A nonzero completely positive trace-nonincreasing map that probabilistically produces superposition on a domain exists if and only if that domain is overlap-determinable. This unifies modern no-superposition results and characterizes the exceptional yes-go protocols, which succeed precisely when side information supplies the required missing resource. We then show that granting universal access to such convention-fixed overlaps destabilizes the familiar foundational and computational constraints. It enables forbidden transformations akin to quantum cloning and yields super-luminal signaling. It would also permit reflections about unknown states, leading to exponentially fast overlap amplification and a collapse of Grover's search lower bound to a logarithmic query complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005emonstratedquantum superposition\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": " motivate\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u53ea\u77e5\u9053\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u6295\u5f71\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u76f8\u4f4d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u56f0\u5883\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u95e8\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We compare the performance of different optimization methods, showing that stochastic reconfiguration is a robust and reliable optimizer.

Large active spaces are required to converge the variational energy, but ulitmately orbital optimization produces worse diffusion Monte Carlo energies when compared to standard orbitals from density functional theory. We show that this increased bias is due to larger locality errors from the use of pseudopotentials, while the fixed-node error is actually improved by using orbital optimization.

Recently, distributed quantum sensing (DQS) has been investigated to boost the sensing performance, yet current schemes typically rely on entangled probes that are fragile to noise and difficult to scale. Here, we propose a DQS protocol that incorporates a causal-order switch into a cyclic network, enabling a single probe to sequentially query N independent sensors in a coherent superposition or a probabilistic mixture of opposite causal orders. By exploiting the noncommutativity between propagation and sensing processes, our scheme achieves a 1/N^2-scaling precision limit without involving entangled probes. Importantly, our approach utilizes a classical mixture of causal orders rather than a quantum switch, making it more feasible for practical realization. We experimentally implement this scheme for distributed beam tilts sensing in a free-space quantum optical network comprising up to 9 sensors, achieving picoradian-scale precision in estimating tilt angle.

We examine di!erent initial conditions for the particle loop, including configurations that are elliptic in space at a given time and configurations that are elliptic in spacetime at a fixed propagation distance. Furthermore, employing a non-uniform mass distribution allows the particle loop to mimic the STVP not only in configuration space but also in momentum space.

A peculiar feature of the complex $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $\u03b7$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $\u0394=(d-2+\u03b7)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n>1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By injecting a spin-orbit torque, the magnetization is driven into auto-oscillation and eventually into a non-equilibrium reversed state above a secondary current threshold ($\\sim$1.2$\\times$10$^7$~A/cm$^2$). The dispersion is measured by wavevector-resolved BLS and exhibits a sharp change from an upward dispersion to a downward one, in agreement with theoretical predictions and micromagnetic simulations. Around the threshold current, we observe the coexistence of conventional magnons and antimagnons.

We then use this setup to test whether the brane worldvolume theory decouples from the bulk.

Moreover, an analysis of graviton fluctuations shows the presence of an infinite potential barrier near the branes, providing a direct indication of decoupling.

The network consists of qubits interconnected through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and consensus-like diffusive interactions. Such networks commonly arise in spontaneous emission processes and non-Hermitian quantum computing, and their evolution follows a Lindblad master equation. Blended dynamics theory is well established in the classical setting as a tool for analyzing emergent behaviors in heterogeneous networks with diffusive couplings. Its key insight is to blend the local dynamics rather than the trajectories of individual nodes. Perturbation analysis then shows that, under sufficiently strong coupling, all node trajectories tend to stay close to those of the blended system over time. We first show that this theory extends naturally to the reduced-state dynamics of quantum networks, revealing classical-like clustering phenomena in which qubits converge to a shared equilibrium or a common trajectory determined by the quantum blended reduced-state dynamics. We then extend the analysis to qubit coherent states using quantum Laplacians and induced graphs, proving orbit attraction of the network density operator toward the quantum blended coherent dynamics, establishing the emergence of intrinsically quantum and dynamically clustering behaviors. Finally, numerical examples validate the theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "We developed a blended dynamics framework for complex open quantum networks, examining how qubits interact through Hamiltonian couplings, environmental dissipation, and diffusive interactions.

We show how our construction streamlines computations, naturally accommodates the contributions from principal and complementary series in the K\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann spectral decomposition of composite operators, and leads to an inversion formula for the spectral density.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728d+1\u7ef4de Sitter\u65f6\u7a7a\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u3001\u975e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u5728dS\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7SO(1,d+1)\u7fa4\u7684\u5355\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\u6807\u7b7edS\u9891\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728Konatorovitch-Lebedev-Fourier\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7b97\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u8c10\u6ce2\u5c55\u5f00\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0eMinkowski\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u7c7b\u5e73\u76f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728KLF\u52a8\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e86\u5165\u5165\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5305\u542bK\u00e4ll\u00e9n-Lehmann\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u548c\u8f85\u7cfb\u6570\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u53cd\u6f14\u8c31\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u3002"}}

It is widely known that typical pure states yield vanishing work, just as thermal states do, when one restricts to local operations that cannot access correlations among subsystems. However, it remains unclear whether this equivalence to thermal states persists under LOCC (local operations and classical communication), where classically accessible correlations can be exploited for work extraction. In this work, we establish criteria for determining whether many-body pure states remain equivalent to thermal states even under LOCC, and show that this thermal equivalence is governed by their multipartite quantum correlation structure. We show that states with asymptotically maximal multipartite entanglement, such as Haar-random states, cannot yield extensive work under LOCC, whereas some states with limited multipartite entanglement, such as constant-degree graph states, allow extensive work extraction despite being locally indistinguishable from thermal states. Thus, our work provides a refined operational notion of thermal equivalence beyond the traditional local regime, which is becoming increasingly important due to the recent expansion of experimentally accessible operations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7eaf\u6001\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\uff08LOCC\uff09\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u70ed\u6001\u7b49\u4ef7\u4ecd\u6709\u7591\u95ee\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7eaf\u6001\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u70ed\u6001\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u9ad8\u591a\u91cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u529f\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u9650\u6001\u5374\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u529f\u3002\u8fd9\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u70ed\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5c40\u57df\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u53ca\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7eaf\u6001\u7684\u70ed\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5c40\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\uff08LOCC\uff09\u4e0b\u7eaf\u6001\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u70ed\u6001\u7b49\u4ef7\u4ecd\u6709\u7591\u95ee\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7eaf\u6001\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5224\u522b\u7eaf\u6001\u5728LOCC\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u70ed\u6001\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u51c6\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u7eaf\u6001\u5728LOCC\u4e0b\u4e0e\u70ed\u6001\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u7531\u5176\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u7ed3\u6784\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u9ad8\u591a\u91cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u4e0d\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u529f\uff0c\u800c\u6709\u9650\u6001\u5374\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u70ed\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5c40\u57df\u89c2\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c40\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0b\u7eaf\u6001\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u53ef\u53ca\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Such a phase appears to be in tension with a state counting interpretation of the partition function and its relation to the de Sitter entropy. It has been recently argued that the phase associated with the gravitational path integral can be cancelled by including the contribution of an observer. In this note, we compute the total phase of Vasiliev higher spin gravity on the sphere by summing over the contributions of all spins. We evaluate the resulting infinite sum using two different regularization schemes, obtaining consistent results. We find that for the non-minimal Vasiliev theory, which includes massless fields of all integer spins, the total phase vanishes in all dimensions.

Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers.

Here, a locally realistic model of quantum physics is developed (Rational Mechanics - RaQM - based on a gravitational discretisation of Hilbert Space) which violates MI without denying free will. Crucially, RaQM distinguishes experimenters' ability to freely choose measurement settings to some nominal accuracy, from an inability to choose exact settings, which were never under their control anyway. In RaQM, Hilbert states are necessarily undefined in bases where squared amplitudes and/or complex phases are irrational numbers. Such `irrational' bases correspond to conceivable but necessarily impossible counterfactual measurements, and are shown to play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of both single- and entangled-particle quantum physics. It is concluded that violation of Bell inequalities can be understood with none of the strange processes historically associated with it.

(arXiv:2510:10967) also construct a nearly linear-time DQI algorithm for OPI using slightly different techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Specifically, for qubit thermometers evolving under Markovian dynamics, we show that enhanced precision beyond the steady state limit can be achieved if and only if the probe is initially colder than the thermal state corresponding to the bath temperature to be estimated. In contrast, this temperature bias can be lifted when the probe dynamics is non-Markovian. In the non-Markovian regime, both hot and cold probes can simultaneously attain the same transient maximum precision, well above the steady-state value.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u6e29\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u521d\u6001\u6bd4\u70ed baths\u66f4\u51b7\u624d\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7a33\u6001\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6e29\u548c\u4f4e\u6e29\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u540c\u6837\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u6001\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u63a2\u9488\u521d\u59cb\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u6e29\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u7a33\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff1b2. \u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u9ad8\u6e29\u8fd8\u662f\u4f4e\u6e29\u63a2\u9488\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8d8a\u7a33\u6001\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6e29\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u63a2\u9488\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d7\u521d\u6001\u6e29\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}
