Abstract: In this work, we report on the thermomagnetic characterization and crystalline-electric field (CEF) energy scheme of the disordered defect-fluorite Ho2Zr2O7. This structural phase is distinguished by the coexistence of magnetic frustration and extensive disorder, with Ho3+ and Zr4+ sharing randomly the same 4a site with even 50% occupancy, and an average 1/8 oxygen vacancy per unit cell. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on powder samples down to 0.5 K revealed signs of slowing spin dynamics without glassy behavior, including a frequency dependent peak at 1 K. Yet, no evidence for long-range magnetic order is found down to 150 mK in specific heat. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show a weak, low-lying CEF excitation around 2 meV, accompanied by a broad level centered at 60 meV. To fit our observations, we propose an approach to account for structural disorder in the crystal-field splitting of the non-Kramers Ho3+. Our model provides an explanation to the broadening of the high-energy, single-ion excitations and suggests that the zirconate ground-state wave function has zero magnetic moment. However, structural disorder acts as guarantor of the magnetism in Ho2Zr2O7, allowing the mixing of low lying states at finite temperatures. Finally, we show that this scenario is in good agreement with the bulk properties reported in this work.

Abstract: Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.

Abstract: Motivated by recent theoretical predictions of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice (S-SkL) in centrosymmetric tetragonal Ce-based magnets [Yan Zha and Satoru Hayami, Phys. Rev. B 111, 165155 (2025)], we perform a comprehensive theoretical investigation on the role of multiorbital effects, magnetic anisotropy, and momentum-based frustrated exchange interactions in stabilizing such topologically nontrivial magnetic textures. By employing self-consistent mean-field calculations over a broad range of model parameters, we demonstrate that the cooperative interplay among multiorbital effects, frustrated exchange interactions at higher-harmonic wave vectors, and crystal-field anisotropy is crucial for the stabilization of the S-SkL. Furthermore, the competition between the easy-plane intraorbital coupling and the easy-axis interorbital coupling leads to a significant enhancement of the S-SkL stability region. We also identify a plethora of multi-$Q$ states, including magnetic bubble lattice and double-$Q$ phases with a local/global scalar chirality. Our findings elucidate the microscopic mechanism responsible for the emergence of S-SkLs in Ce-based magnets and provide a route toward realizing skyrmion lattices in a broader class of $f$-electron materials beyond conventional Gd- and Eu-based systems lacking orbital angular momentum.

Abstract: Thermally activated abrupt switching between localized and itinerant electronic states during the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in correlated oxide systems serves as a powerful platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena and device functionality. One ongoing focal challenge lies in the realization of the broadly tunable IMT property in correlated system, to satisfy the demands of practical applications across diverse environments. Here, we unveil the overwhelming advantage associated with interfacial strain in bridging the bandwidth and band-filling control over the IMT property of VO2. Tailoring the orbital overlapping through strain-mediated bandwidth control enables a widely tunable thermally-driven IMT property in VO2. Benefiting from adjustable defect dynamics, filling-controlled Mott phase modulations from electron-localized t2g1eg0 state to electron-itinerant t2g1+Δeg0 state through oxygen vacancies can be facilitated by using in-plane tensile distortion, overcoming the high-speed bottlenecks in iontronic devices. Defect-engineered electronic phase transitions are primarily governed by the electron filling in t2g band of VO2, showcasing a definitive relationship with the incorporated defect concentration. Our findings provide fundamentally new insights into the on-demand design of emergent electronic states and transformative functionalities in correlated oxide system by unifying two fundamental control paradigms of bandwidth and band-filling control.

### [5] [Prevailing orbital excitations in paramagnetic kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05999)
*Chennan Wang,Yuhang Zhang,Zhen Zhao,Zhouyouwei Lu,Hui Chen,Ziqiang Wang,Haitao Yang,Christian Bernhard,Xiaoli Dong,Hong-Jun Gao*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The kagome lattice material Cs(V0.95Ti0.05)3Sb5 displays magnetic properties governed by orbital excitations, featureless at low temperatures, but lattice distortions appear at 70 K. Orbital dynamics likely originate from spin-orbit coupling in non-chiral point groups.

motivation: This is a critical point in the kagome lattice and spin-orbit coupling research.

method: Used muon spectroscopy in various conditions (transverse field, zero field) and observed properties like local magnetic susceptibility, persisting IEP, and lattice distortion.

result: Orbital dynamics dominate, long-range magnetic order is absent in zero field, but lattice distortions emerge at low temps. Spin-orbit coupling is vital in causing phonon angular momentum carrying.

conclusion: The material has an intrinsic orbital character, and spin-orbit coupling intricately links to lattice dynamics, pushing for investigations of phenomena like phonon-angled momenta in similar non-chiral crystals.

Motivation: 研究该 Kagome 网络材料的磁性特征和来自轨道运动的主导作用，尤其是在涉及无晶格静磁性的情况下理解材料行为非常重要。

Method: 通过在各种条件（横场、零场）下使用 μ 射线进行了磁学测量，包括通过 μ 射线的 Knight 移动检测到的局部磁性易化和 persistent 英语铁磁性，还有从零场 μ 射线实验中观察到的不均匀核 Dipolar 场分布的显著增加，从而详细分析了材料的热学特征。

Result: 在各种条件下的 μ 射线测量揭示了该材料的磁性特征主要由轨道激发主导，材料不存在静磁性，且即使在低温下也存在这种现象。同时，在低温下出现了局部晶格变形，在材料的 Kagome 网络结构中发现，轨道激发可能是一个固有的性质。观察到的零场 μ 射线特征反映了温度的显著降低导致的结合问题，这些结合涉及到轨道运动产生的晶格动力学。关键是，通过零场 μ 射线测量的数据发现了在材料的层叠结构中原子振动的变形几率的变化，这可能来自于轨道运动的产生。此外，通过分析发现，材料的这种变形符合 soft 声子模型。

Conclusion: 在没有静磁性或长程电荷有序的情况下，该 Kagome 晶体表现出由离域轨道激发主导的磁性。材料中的零场 μ 射线测量支持这种假设，并且这种行为可能有助于解释某些在非双曲点群晶格中出现的新型物理现象，例如将声子的动量传递给电磁动量的现象。这一发现将促进对非双曲点群晶格中的这方面现象的研究。

Abstract: Using the muon as a sensitive local magnetic probe, we investigated the layered kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, a material notably devoid of both static magnetic moments and long-range charge order. Our transverse-field $μ$SR measurements reveal that the local magnetic susceptibility, obtained via the muon Knight shift, is dominated by orbital excitations with a split energy levels around 20 meV. Meanwhile, the persistence of itinerant electron paramagnetism down to 5 K and 7 T confirms the absence of static magnetism within this regime. In addition, zero-field (ZF) $μ$SR experiments detect a significant increase in the inhomogeneous nuclear dipolar field distribution below a featured temperature at 70 K. We attribute this ZF-$μ$SR feature to the emergence of local lattice distortions at low temperatures, potentially arising from orbital ordering. Significantly, our study establishes that orbital excitations constitute an intrinsic property of the layered V-Sb kagome lattice. Despite its small magnitude, spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in governing the lattice dynamics, potentially driving the emergence of novel phenomena such as phonon carrying angular momentum in crystals with non-chiral point groups.

*N. P. Konstantinidis*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: 研究论文摘要：在磁场中，经典反铁磁XX模型的基态在正二十面体上计算出，体系磁化强度随外磁场呈现两个不连续点。在离散外磁场较第一不连续点的较宽范围内，基态高度退化，磁矩与磁场方向平行的两自旋对通过空间反转联结，剩余磁矩表现为两个由五边形形成长量磁化强度。这些退化来源于由两个五边形叠加形成的三角形的相互作用。磁化强度的不连续首先是孤立三角形的相互作用引起的，而后随着两相反的自旋 couples一同作用下才稳定发展。

Motivation: 自旋体系态与外部磁场间关系是量子磁性领域的重要研究对象。文章在二十面体结构基点，建立了反铁磁Heisenberg模型，计算出基态中的断磁行为，解析了多阶段相变过程中磁性退化机制，研究结果可能对未来量子态调控和磁性计算材料设计提供有价值的参考。

Method: 论文采用经典反铁磁Heisenberg模型，分别将二十面体作为顶点自旋配置基础，结合边界条件对外外磁场和几何结构进行求解。利用对称性分析磁场下自旋配位排列，得到基态磁化特性。

Result: 研究发现，外磁场下，该模型的基态中存在两个磁化强度不连续。在磁化强度不连续最先出现第二个磁化断裂前，磁性高度退化区域。此时体系具有高度的自发对称性。磁化强度在第一不连续点离第二不连续点以上区域内两步变化。磁化强度不连续性原由在二十面体结构中的三角形相互作用引起的。

Conclusion: 足以说明，作者在二十面体的自旋配位体系中，首次研究了磁场作用下基态磁化的不连续特性。研究成果可为晶体材料的磁性行为研究提供新视角和理论框架，同时为相关二维材料如石墨烯等特性研究提供理论指导。

Abstract: The ground state of the classical antiferromagnetic XX model in a magnetic field is calculated for spins mounted on the vertices of the icosahedron. The magnetization is characterized by two discontinuities as a function of the external field. For a wide field range above the first discontinuity the ground state is degenerate, with two spins related by spatial inversion aligned with the field and the rest forming two magnetization units in the form of pentagons. It is shown that the degeneracy originates from the coupling of the two pentagons, which introduces the triangle, associated with ground-state degeneracy, as an interaction unit in the icosahedron. The magnetization discontinuities are shown to evolve first from the coupling of isolated triangles and then from the coupling of the two spins related by spatial inversion.

### [7] [Large Spontaneous Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in a Zero-Magnetization Antiferromagnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06009)
*Kenta Sudo,Yuki Yanagi,Mitsuru Akaki,Hiroshi Tanida,Motoi Kimata*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The study reports spontaneous nonreciprocal charge transport in the zigzag intermetallic compound NdRu2Al10, linked to antiferromagnetic order characterized as a magnetic toroidal dipole order, with a large nonreciprocal coefficient due to strong effective magnetic fields generated through c-f exchanges. The findings distinguish this material's nonreciprocal response, which depends on the spin configurations of the antiferromagnetic domains, and contribute to understanding symmetry-broken metals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding nonreciprocal charge transport in metals, particularly those without an applied magnetic field, is crucial for advancing the fundamental physics of symmetry-broken states and could lead to novel applications in spintronic devices and other electromagnetic systems.

Method: The research involved growing high-quality crystals of NdRu2Al10 and conducting DC transport measurements under zero magnetic field. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to analyze the spatial distribution of the magnetic dipole order, while ab initio calculations provided insights into the spin configurations and exchange interactions within the material.

Result: The experimental observations confirmed the spontaneous occurrence of nonreciprocal charge transport in NdRu2Al10, which was attributed to the antiferromagnetic order. The nonreciprocal coefficient was found to be unusually large, attributed to the robust effective magnetic fields generated via c-f exchange interactions. Additionally, the study revealed that the nonreciprocal response is highly dependent on the spin textures of the antiferromagnetic domains.

Conclusion: The discovery of spontaneous nonreciprocal charge transport in a symmetry-broken metal without an applied magnetic field significantly expands our understanding of cross-correlations in such systems. This work opens new avenues for exploring similar phenomena in other noncentrosymmetric materials and lays the foundation for potential applications in spintronic technologies and related fields.

Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in solids triggers diverse intriguing phenomena. Although these phenomena have been extensively studied in insulators, similar investigations for metals remain limited. Herein, we report the observation and properties of spontaneous (i.e., zero-magnetic field) nonreciprocal charge transport in the zigzag intermetallic compound NdRu2Al10. This effect is attributed to the antiferromagnetic (AF) order, which can be interpreted as a magnetic toroidal dipole order. Our results reveal an excessively large nonreciprocal coefficient for this material, attributed to the strong effective magnetic field generated through c-f exchange interactions. The results also suggest that the nonreciprocal response of this material depends on the spin configurations of the AF domains. Overall, our findings are distinct from those previously reported for field-induced nonreciprocal charge transport and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cross-correlations in symmetry-broken metals.

Conclusion: Kitaev模型可能在描述多维材料的磁行为中更有效。

Abstract: Bond-dependent magnetic interactions, particularly those described by the Kitaev model, have emerged as a key pathway toward realizing unconventional magnetic states such as quantum spin liquids and topologically nontrivial excitations, including skyrmions. These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.

Abstract: We investigate displacive short-range order in pyrochlore Y2Nb2O7, which exhibits a nonmagnetic insulating state despite the presence of formally tetravalent Nb4+ (S = 1/2) ions on the pyrochlore network. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction on a single crystal reveals a characteristic x-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) pattern primarily around q = {0.5, 0.5, 2}. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations uncover local Nb displacements along the <111> axes, leading to the formation of linear Nb4 tetramers. Our findings highlight a crucial role of molecular orbital degrees of freedom in stabilizing the nonmagnetic insulating state. This study demonstrates that RMC analysis of XDS provides a powerful approach for elucidating short-range correlations and the underlying mechanisms governing the physical properties of crystalline materials.

TL;DR: Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, but the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. In this paper, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within a 2X2X1 charge density wave superlattice. The anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, with a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Unlike previous interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. The results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice, and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.

Abstract: The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2<0.45 and the collinear phase for J2>0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.

Abstract: The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $μ_aS_a<μ_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $χ_0\propto e^{4πS_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $χ_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.

Abstract: We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $π/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.

Motivation: Understanding the mechanisms behind metal-insulator transitions is fundamental in condensed matter physics, particularly in unpredictable and complex systems.

Method: The study employed experimental compression studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to analyze the material's electronic structure under increased pressure.

Result: 1. The room-temperature material KV2Se2O exhibits an unexpected spin-density-wave magnetic ground state. 2. Pressure induces a metal-insulator transition accompanied by a direct gap opening of 40 meV. 3. The carrier type and Fermi surface undergo significant reconstruction during this transition. 4. DFT calculations confirm the material's transition to a spin-singlet state with orbital ordering.

Conclusion: The research reveals a prototype for a pressure-induced metal-insulator transition, decoupled from structural alteration, offering fundamental insights into the behavior of complex many-body systems.

Abstract: Among the complex many-body systems, the metal-insulator transition stands out as a cornerstone and a particularly fertile ground for scientific inquiry. The established models including Mott insulator, Anderson localization and Peierls transition, are still insufficient to capture the complex and intertwined phenomena observed in certain material systems. KV2Se2O, a newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic candidate exhibiting a spin-density-wave transition below 100 K, provides a unique platform to investigate the interplay of many-body effects and unconventional magnetism, specifically the anticipated metal-insulator transition under extreme conditions. Here, we report a compression-induced insulator by suppressing the metallic behavior without structural phase transition. The newly opened gap is estimated to be 40 meV at around 43.5 GPa, given direct evidence for the insulating state. A concurrent switching of carrier type demonstrates the large Fermi surface reconstruction crossing the metal-insulator transition. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the discovered V+2.5-based insulator is a magnetic obstructed atomic insulator, being a spin-singlet state with bonding orbital order. This work not only presents an archetype of a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition decoupled from structural change but also delivers fundamental physical insights into the metal-insulator transition.

Abstract: The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.

### [16] [Low Temperature Two Fluid State in SmB6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07000)
*Sayantan Ghosh,Sugata Paul,Tamoghna Chattoraj,Ritesh Kumar,Zachary Fisk,S. S. Banerjee*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper reveals three distinct temperature regimes in SmB6, with Kondo breakdown and surface state transitions occurring at critical temperatures. The bulk Kondo temperature is around 116K, while two surface-related temperatures are 7K for the bulk and 40K for the surface. At lower temperatures, magnetic screening by surface Kondo效应 stabilizes topological states, and plasma oscillations shift the effective mass of carriers, affecting the electrical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kondo effect and topological surface states in SmB6 are of significant interest in condensed matter physics, and understanding their temperature-dependent behaviors provides insights into materials' quantum properties and potential applications.

Method: This study employs DC transport measurements, specific heat analysis, magnetization, and mutual inductance measurements to investigate SmB6's temperature regimes.

Result: SmB6 exhibits three key temperature regimes (T ≥ T*, Tg < T < T*, and T < Tg) influenced by disorder and magnetic fluctuations. At T < Tg, surface carriers become high-mobility, leading to two fluid phases of heavy and light quasiparticles with an in-gap feature of about 2.2 meV. The onset of Kondo breakdown at T* induces magnetic fluctuations that split bulk and surface Kondo temperatures, and the characteristic length scale near Tgs reveals the carrier mobility changes above continuous symmetry restoration.

Conclusion: SmB6's surface conducting state is highly complex, involving a two-fluid phase and topological transitions at distinct temperatures, requiring further investigation to understand its quantum nature and potential applications in spintronic devices.

Abstract: Comprehensive study using DC transport, specific heat, magnetization, and two-coil mutual inductance measurements unveils an understanding of three temperature regimes in SmB$_6$: (i) $T \geq T^{*}$ ($\sim66$K), (ii) $T_g$ ($\sim40$ K) $\leq T < T^{*}$, and (iii) $T < T_g$. Onset of Kondo breakdown below $T^{*}$ releases disorder-driven magnetic fluctuations, which splits the bulk ($\sim116$K) and surface Kondo temperature ($T_k^{s} \approx 7$ K). Below $T_g$, as magnetic fluctuations subside, surface Kondo screening revives, stabilizing the topological surface state and generating an in-gap feature ($\sim2.2$ meV) across which Dirac-like carriers are excited. Nyquist impedance analysis reveals a crossover from purely capacitive to capacitive-inductive behavior, signalling a disorder-driven two-fluid phase of heavy quasiparticles and light, high-mobility carriers below $T_g$. We identify a characteristic length scale, $L_{ν_0}(T)$, associated with the high-mobility phase, exhibiting an almost divergent trend below $T_k^{s}$. These findings underscore the complex nature of the surface conducting state in SmB$_6$.

Motivation: 该研究旨在解决DFT和静态DFT+$U$方法在描述Ce介磁性能时的局限性，寻找一种更精确的方法来描述Ce $^{4+}$ - Ce $^{3+}$价层跳跃现象。

Method: 该研究采用了DFT+$U$与Anderson impurity模型的结合方法，通过精确计算Ce 4$f$壳层的密度泛函以及价层跳跃对磁矩的影响，最终得到了与实验一致的磁矩和能量结果。

Result: 研究结果表明：与实验值相比，DFT+$U$模型能够准确预测Ce介的6.70 µ_B磁矩、4$f$态密度及4.8 meV/f.u.的单轴磁性能量值，验证了价层跳跃理论的重要性和 sneak 的效度。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，价层跳跃是Ce介磁性能的关键机制，且通过DFT+$U$方法能够准确定量分析其磁矩和磁性相关的物理量等。

Abstract: The intermediate valence of Ce in CeCo$_5$ challenges standard density functional theory (DFT) and static DFT+$U$ approaches, which fail to capture its magnetic properties. By combining DFT+$U$ with exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model for the Ce 4$f$ shell, we find a substantial reduction of Ce spin and orbital moments, consistent with DFT+DMFT, arising from Ce$^{4+}$ - Ce$^{3+}$ valence fluctuations. The total magnetic moment of 6.70 $μ_B$ agrees with experiment, and the calculated $4f$ density of states reproduces photoemission and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 4.8 meV/f.u. when Coulomb correlations on both Ce 4$f$ and Co 3$d$ shells are included, in very good agreement with experimental data. These results highlight the importance of dynamical correlations and provide guidance for exploring high-performance, low-rare-earth-content permanent magnets.

Motivation: Understanding the effects of mechanical stress on magnetic materials is crucial for both fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronic devices.

Method: The study combines resistivity, magnetization, and neutron scattering measurements, supported by first-principles calculations.

Result: Applying compressive stresses along [010] increases the antiferromagnetic character and modifies the magnetic modulation period, enhancing the critical temperatures and fields of various phases.

Conclusion: The findings reveal a significant influence of lattice stress on magnetic ordering in EuAl4, highlighting the role of Fermi-surface nesting and lattice distortions in stabilizing helical magnetic states.

Abstract: We investigate uniaxial-stress effects on the magnetic phase diagram of the square-lattice itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$, where strong coupling among spin, lattice, and charge produces a variety of helimagnetic phases, including rhombic and square skyrmion lattices. Combining resistivity and magnetization measurements with neutron scattering, we find that compressive stresses of only several tens of MPa along [010] enhance antiferromagnetic character and shorten the magnetic modulation period in the lowest-temperature single-Q spiral state, thereby driving the critical temperatures and fields of multiple phases to higher values. First-principles calculations show that increasing orthorhombic lattice distortion deforms the Fermi surface relevant to the magnetism, providing compelling evidence that Fermi-surface nesting plays a crucial role in stabilizing the helical magnetic modulations in EuAl$_{4}$.

Abstract: The Kondo effect emerges when a localized spin is screened by conduction electrons, giving rise to a strongly-correlated many-body ground state. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot, focusing on the spatial extension of the Kondo screening cloud in the electron reservoirs. To probe its properties, the dot is coupled to an electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometer, enabling controlled modulation of the density of states at the Fermi level. The observation of Kondo temperature oscillations indicates a Kondo screening length comparable to the cavity size. Furthermore, we explore how the coupling asymmetry with the two reservoirs affects both the amplitude and the phase of the conductance oscillations, revealing a subtle interplay between coherent transport and Kondo effect.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a machine learning framework based on kernel ridge regression can encode and predict the self-energy of one-dimensional Hubbard models using only mean-field features such as static and dynamic Hartree-Fock quantities and first-order GW calculations. This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t > 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.

Abstract: Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.

Abstract: We present a framework to characterize Mott insulating phases within the interacting one-body picture, focusing on the Hubbard diamond chain featuring both Hubbard interactions and spin-orbit coupling simulated within cellular dynamical mean field theory. Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.

Abstract: The formation of flat electronic bands from long-wavelength superperiodic moiré potentials in van der Waals heterostructures underpins the creation and control of a host of highly-tuneable correlated and topological phases. The underlying moiré periodicity is, however, typically considered a fixed property of the heterostructure. Here, we show how the development of a charge-density wave (CDW) in one of the constituent materials can create an emergent moiré periodicity, realising a superperiodic potential in TiSe$_2$/graphite epitaxial heterostructures with an order-of-magnitude longer wavelength than that expected from the normal-state lattice mismatch. We demonstrate how this drives the formation of a remarkably strong band flattening, which can be readily deactivated by carrier doping across the CDW phase transition, opening new prospects for engineering moiré matter by exploiting the rich many-body states of the parent compounds of 2D heterostructures.

TL;DR: Using neural networks to predict n-RDMs for large systems by leveraging their smoothness in the Brillouin zone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating and efficiently calculating n-RDMs for strongly-correlated systems is a challenging problem, especially as system sizes grow. Neural networks offer a promising approach to address this efficiency issue by exploiting the smoothness of n-RDMs.

Method: Two neural network architectures are proposed: (i) a self-attention network that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. These networks are tested on three 2D models, and their performance in predicting 1-RDMs and pair-pair correlation functions is evaluated.

Result: The SIREN network achieves a relative accuracy of 0.839 in predicting a 18x18 pair-pair correlation function based on a 6x6 momentum mesh. Additionally, the neural networks provide high-quality initial guesses for translation-invariant and fully translation-breaking Hartree-Fock calculations, significantly reducing the number of iterations required for convergence in larger systems.

Conclusion: The success of neural networks in predicting and initializing n-RDMs suggests their potential as a powerful tool for studying strongly-correlated phases of matter, offering a new avenue for future research in this field.

Abstract: $n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\times 6 \sim 8\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\%$ and $92.78\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.

Abstract: We investigate the quantum phases of higher-spin Kitaev models using tensor network methods. Our results reveal distinct bond-ordered phases for spin-1, spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$, and spin-2 models. In all cases, we find translational symmetry breaking with unit cells being tripled by forming valence-bond orders. However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis. Our work sheds light upon the interplay between topological and symmetry-breaking orders as well as their detection via tensor networks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The spin-orbit (SO) coupling is conventionally known to manifest as \emph{odd} functions of momentum. Here, through both model calculations and symmetry analysis along with the method of invariants, we reveal that, in ordinary semiconductor heterostructures, a \emph{quadratic} Dresselhaus SO term -- inheriting from its bulk crystal form -- emerges via the interband effect, while complying with time-reversal and spatial symmetries. Furthermore, we observe that this unusual SO term gives rise to a range of striking quantum phenomena, including hybridized swirling texture, anisotropic energy dispersion, avoided band crossing, longitudinal \emph{Zitterbewegung}, and opposite spin evolution between different bands in quantum dynamics. These stand in stark contrast to those associated with the usual \emph{linear} SO terms. Our findings uncover a previously overlooked route for exploiting interband effects and open new avenues for spintronic functionalities that leverage unusual SO terms of \emph{even} orders in momentum.

Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to create a versatile electronic device that can operate in two fundamentally different conducting modes, which has not been achieved before. Understanding and controlling these modes is essential for improving the performance of advanced electronic materials and devices, especially in the context of next-generation transistors and circuitry.

Method: The researchers developed a monolayer metal dichalcogenide MOSFET on a ferroelectric substrate and tested it at cryogenic temperatures and higher temperatures. They measured the current fluctuations in the low-temperature regime and analyzed the material behavior at higher temperatures to observe the shift in conductivity mechanisms.

Result: The results show that the metal dichalcogenide MOSFET exhibits an unusual behavior where it can switch between two distinct modes of conductance: quantum correlation at low temperatures and nearly ballistic transport at higher temperatures. They achieved a record high electron mobility of 4,800 cm²/Vs at room temperature and a per-micrometer on-current of 0.5 mA.

Conclusion: This study provides insights into how electrons can transition between quantum and classical transport regimes in a single material system, which could pave the way for designing more efficient transistors. The ability to switch between these modes may have applications in ultrafast electronics, memory devices, and logic circuits operating at elevated temperatures.

Abstract: Quantum correlation and hot-carrier transport represent two fundamentally distinct regimes of electronic conduction, rarely accessible within the same device. Here, we report a state-of-the-art monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides transistor architecture on a ferroelectric substrate that enables this crossover by leveraging the strong dielectric screening and in-plane gate control. At cryogenic temperatures, the devices exhibit reproducible quasi-periodic current fluctuations, consistent with an emergent potential landscape driven by electron-electron interactions at low carrier densities. As the temperature increases, this correlated potential profile thermally dissolves and transport is dominated by the lateral gate-field that drives the carriers with high kinetic energy. These hot-carriers can efficiently surmount the scattering events, exhibiting a record-high room-temperature electron mobility of ~4,800 cm^2/Vs and a maximum on-current ~0.5 mA/μm, surpassing traditional FETs in key performance metrics. These findings establish a unified approach for probing intermediate mesoscopic orders, while advancing the transistor performance limits in scalable 2D transistors.

TL;DR: Antiferromagnetic skyrmions can act as lenses for spin waves when Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) strength exceeds a threshold, leveraging spin wave deflection via DM interaction beyond magnetic topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing lens for spin waves could revolutionise energy-efficient information tech, as spin waves offer potential for reducing energy loss.

Method: Theoretically proposed using spin wave theory, supported by micromagnetic simulations to validate the concept.

Result: Antiferromagnetic skyrmions can function as spin wave lenses when DM strength surpasses a threshold, as shown by simulations.

Conclusion: This breakthrough could advance spin wave technology for low-energy information systems.

Abstract: A lens, a device transforming propagation directions in an organized fashion, is one of the fundamental tools for wave manipulation. Spin wave, the collective excitation of ordered magnetizations, stands out as a promising candidate for future energy-saving information technologies. Here we propose theoretically and verify by micromagnetic simulations, that an antiferromagnetic skyrmion naturally serves as a lens for spin wave, when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength exceeds a threshold. The underlying mechanism is the spin wave deflection caused by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, a mechanism that is ordinarily overshadowed by the magnetic topology.

*Aravindh Shankar,Pramey Upadhyaya,Supriyo Datta*

TL;DR: Negative capacitance enables attractive Coulomb interactions leading to superconducting ground states in two-dimensional electron systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces the concept of negative capacitance to explore novel electronic states, specifically superconducting, in two-dimensional electron systems by altering Coulomb interactions.

Method: The study employs theoretical models of two-dimensional electron systems with linear and parabolic dispersion, coupled with negative capacitance environments. The models are used to evaluate Coulomb interaction strengths and identify parameter ranges that support correlated electronic phases.

Result: The analysis reveals that negative capacitance induces attractive Coulomb interactions, which could lead to a superconducting ground state under specific conditions.

Conclusion: This research opens a new avenue in Coulomb engineering by demonstrating that negative capacitance can create conditions conducive to superconductivity in two-dimensional electron systems.

Abstract: It is known that the many-body ground state of a two-dimensional electron system can be tuned through Coulomb engineering by controlling the permittivity of the surrounding media. However, permittivities are traditionally restricted to positive values. In this paper we argue that the negative capacitance effect demonstrated in appropriately engineered structures can open new vistas in Coulomb engineering. Negative permittivities transform the natural repulsive interaction of electrons into an attractive one raising the intriguing possibility of a superconducting ground state. Using models of two-dimensional electron systems with linear and parabolic dispersion relations coupled to environments with negative capacitance, we estimate the strength and sign of the engineered Coulomb interaction and outline parameter regimes that could stabilize correlated electronic phases.

Abstract: We study the charge transport and thermoelectric properties of the junction, comprising double quantum dot embedded in T-shaped geometry on the interface between two normal/ferromagnetic electrodes and superconducting lead. We show that the interdot coupling plays major role in controlling the local and nonlocal transport properties of this setup. For the weak interdot coupling limit, we obtain the interferometric (Fano-type) lineshapes imprinted in the quasiparticle spectra, conductances and Seebeck coefficients. In contrast, for the strong interdot coupling, we predict that the local and nonlocal transport coefficients are primarily dependent on the molecular Andreev bound states induced by superconducting proximity effect, simultaneously in both quantum dots.

Abstract: Solid-state quantum technologies such as quantum dot qubits and quantum electrical metrology circuits rely on quantum phenomena at ultra-low energies, making them highly sensitive to various forms of environmental noise. Conventional passive filtering schemes can reduce high-frequency noise but are often ineffective against low-frequency interference, like powerline or instrument-induced. Extending such filters to lower frequencies causes practical issues such as longer stabilization times, slower system response, and increased Johnson noise, which impede low-frequency transport measurements. To address these limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a generalized active noise cancellation scheme for quantum devices operating at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Our approach compensates periodic environmental interference by dynamically injecting a phase-coherent anti-noise signal directly into the device. We employ an automated feedback protocol featuring beat-frequency reduction and adaptive phase-amplitude tuning, enabling real-time compensation without any manual intervention. Unlike post-processing or passive filtering, this method suppresses noise at the device level without introducing additional time constants. We implement the scheme on a gate-defined Si/SiGe quantum dot subject to strong 50 Hz powerline interference and validate its effectiveness through acquiring Coulomb Blockade Oscillations and Coulomb diamond plots. The technique achieves substantial suppression of both the targeted interference and the overall noise floor, thereby stabilizing transport characteristics and enhancing device fidelity. While demonstrated on a quantum dot, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of solid-state quantum devices where deterministic noise presents a critical bottleneck.

Abstract: We report a well-resolved 0.7 conductance anomaly at $G = 0.7\times(2e^2/h)$ in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum point contacts. Proximity-enhanced spin-orbit coupling splits the four-fold ground state of bilayer graphene into well-separated spin-valley locked Kramers doublets. The anomaly emerges between these opposite spin-valley states. Despite fundamentally different band structure and wavefunction characteristics, the temperature and bias phenomenology closely mirror GaAs systems. In contrast, the parallel magnetic field response differs significantly, confirming the central role of valley degrees of freedom. This opens new pathways to study valley-exchange correlation physics in regimes inaccessible to conventional semiconductors.

Motivation: Understanding efficient methods for producing nanodiamonds is critical for advancing applications in quantum computing, drug delivery, and material science. The sustainable and scalable nature of hydrothermal synthesis presents a promising avenue, but further research is needed to address sustainability concerns and elucidate formation mechanisms.

Method: A comparative study of ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using organic precursors with COOH and OH groups was conducted. The reactions were performed under controlled conditions in chlorinated, alkaline aqueous solutions containing various ions. Imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to analyze the resulting nanodiamond structures. Atomic-scale imaging captured detailed structural changes during the formation process.

Result: The type of precursor, its molecular size, and ionic composition significantly influence defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the nanodiamonds. Observations included coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, lattice compression, and complex twinning patterns. These findings provide direct evidence of the interplay between interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics during diamond formation.

Conclusion: Hydrothermal synthesis represents a scalable, chemistry-driven method for producing nanodiamonds that can be tailored for specific applications. Further research is needed to improve understanding of the synthesis mechanisms and enhance the sustainability of this method.

Abstract: Hydrothermal synthesis offers an economical and scalable way to produce nanodiamonds under relatively mild, low-pressure and low-temperature conditions. However,its sustainability and the detailed mechanisms behind diamond formation in such environments are still not fully understood. In this work, we designed ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using different CHO-based molecular precursors containing COOH and OH groups, such as organic acids, polyols, sugars, and polysaccharides.The reactions were carried out at 190 degrees Centigrade in chlorinated, strongly alkaline aqueous solutions with alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed the presence of diamond-specific lattice planes and sp3-hybridized carbon structures. Our results show that the type of precursor, its molecular size, and the ionic composition of the solution play key roles in determining the defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the resulting nanodiamonds. Atomic-scale imaging showed both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns. These observations provide direct insight into how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems. Overall, the study positions hydrothermal synthesis as a sustainable, chemistry-driven, and tunable approach for creating nanodiamonds tailored for applications in quantum technologies, biomedicine, catalysis, and advanced materials.

TL;DR: A universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation in chiral magnets was studied and connected to equilibrium phases via the chiral correlation parameter χ. The model incorporates exchange-to-DMI ratio (J′), anisotropy-to-DMI ratio (K′), and magnetic field-to-DMI ratio (B′), and derives a skyrmion formation criterion 0.58 K′J′ + μ B′J′ > 1.

Motivation: To understand the fundamental dynamics of skyrmion formation and their relation to equilibrium phases in chiral magnets.

Method: Combination of symbolic regression and neural networks to model the competition and cooperation of parameters J′, K′, and B′.

Result: Derived a skyrmion formation criterion and identified distinct roles of J′, K′, and B′ in controlling stripe width, skyrmion size, topological charge, and parameter competition.

Conclusion: A general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases using the identified parameters.

Abstract: We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $χ$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + μB'J' > 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.

Abstract: We study the thermal transport properties of a mesoscopic device comprising two metallic islands embedded in a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime. It is shown that the $2M$ ballistic edge channels connecting the islands to the external reservoirs and the $N$ inter-island channels play a central role in the phenomenon of heat Coulomb blockade. Unlike the single-island case, where the heat flux is reduced by exactly one quantum of thermal conductance, we predict an additional suppression proportional to the factor $M^2/(2N+M)^2$. We further examine a configuration in which the islands are placed between electrodes at different temperatures and identify the conditions under which the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.

Abstract: Magnetic interactions between localized spins-1/2 play a central role in quantum magnetism, spin-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation. The range and strength of these interactions are key figures of merit. Here, we probe exchange interactions in pairs and trimers of spins-1/2 introduced by chemisorption of individual hydrogen atoms on graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.

Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.

Abstract: We present an analytical framework that predicts and controls nanoparticle size through external magnetic fields, uniting first-principles thermodynamics with a sphere packing approach. Calibrated to diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (20 nm at zero field and 5 nm at 250 mT), the model yields a closed-form relation between radius and field that reproduces the observed shift in most-probable size. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.

Abstract: Synchronization resulting in unified collective behavior of the individual elements of a system that are weakly coupled to each other has long fascinated scientists. Examples range from the periodic oscillation of coupled pendulum clocks to the rhythmic behavior in biological systems. Here we demonstrate this effect in a solid-state platform: spatially remote, auto-oscillating electron-nuclear spin systems in a semiconductor. When two such oscillators separated by up to 40 $μ$m are optically pumped, their individually different frequencies lock to a common value, revealing long-range coherent coupling. For larger separations, the synchronization breaks. The interaction distance matches the electron spin diffusion length, identifying spin transport as the coupling-mediating mechanism and establishing phase coherence over mesoscopic distances. As a consequence, a wide-area optical pump drives all oscillators within the illuminated spot into a single synchronized state, despite their inhomogeneity. This synchronization accounts for the exceptional stability of the resulting auto-oscillations, enabling collective motion in distributed spin systems and paving the way toward coherent spin networks in spintronics.

TL;DR: The paper studies oscillations in a hybrid system of superconducting microwave resonators and voltage-biased double quantum dots.

The system is analyzed using perturbation theory and Markovian master equations. The result agrees well with experimental observations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding oscillations in hybrid quantum systems is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and communication. This paper contributes to the knowledge of how active components can stabilize and synchronize complex systems.

Method: The researchers used a combination of theoretical analysis, including perturbation theory and Markovian master equations, to model the system. They likely performed numerical simulations to validate their findings.

Result: The system exhibits Hopf bifurcation, leading to limit-cycle oscillations. These oscillations can synchronize when coupled with similar frequencies. The perturbative and Markovian approaches accurately predict these behaviors, which align with experimental data.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding self-sustained oscillations in hybrid quantum systems, offering insights that could be applied to designing future quantum devices.

Abstract: Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.

Conclusion: Proposed design provides a CMOS-compatible solution for efficient integrated photonic circuits in the mid-infrared, suitable for applications like optical phased arrays.

Abstract: This paper delivers the first report of a mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide array design that employs complementary and asym- metric tapered Euler-shaped bends. These provide greater fabrication flexibility to achieve subwavelength-pitch integration while reducing crosstalk to below 30 dB across the 3.1 to 3.6 micron wavelength range. Unlike previous designs, which main- tained constant waveguide widths, the Euler waveguide bends are characterized by asymmetric and complementary tapered waveguide widths. This approach significantly reduces crosstalk to below 30 dB for both the first and second neighboring waveguides across a 500 nm wavelength range, enhancing the efficiency of optical phased arrays (OPA) with a large field of view, optimizing light propagation and minimizing crosstalk. The waveguide array is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2-micron buried oxide layer and a 500 nm-thick silicon layer. The design is highly tolerant to fabrication variations, maintaining consistent performance even with width variations. The spectral responses, simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain method, demonstrate negligible coupling and low insertion loss across the wavelength range. This work offers a robust and CMOS-compatible solution for MIR integrated photonic circuits.

Abstract: Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.

### [45] [Controlling Quantum Transport in a Superconducting Device via Dissipative Baths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07196)
*S. V. Aksenov,M. S. Shustin,I. S. Burmistrov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper explores the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to multiple fermionic reservoirs, deriving generalized formulas and analyzing the effects of contact multiplicity on non-equilibrium steady states and conductance peaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the transport properties of superconducting systems in the presence of multiple fermionic baths is fundamental for advancing quantum materials and device physics.

Method: Employing quantum field theory in the Keldysh formalism and Kirchhoff's circuit laws, the authors derive generalized formulas for the Meir-Wingreen matrix and Onsager matrix, and perform numerical simulations using the extended Kitaev model.

Result: The system exhibits reduced degeneracy multiplicity in its non-equilibrium steady state when coupled to multiple contacts. The conductance shows quantized peaks under non-equilibrium conditions with a single contact, and zero-bias peak suppression in the Majorana mode with dissipation.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of non-equilibrium transport in topological superconductors and provide insights into the design of quantum devices with enhanced control over transport properties.

Abstract: Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.

Abstract: Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.

Abstract: We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1° (below), to 20° (above) the van Hove singularity with 7° and 9° samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9° sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation lies in exploring the real-space origin of topological phenomena in moiré rhombohedral graphene, specifically focusing on the interaction-induced skyrmion lattice and its implications for Chern bands and collective excitations.

Method: The authors utilize an ideal limit approach combined with analytical methods to investigate the effect of short-range repulsion on the graphene multilayers, proposing a mechanism for the formation of skyrmion lattices.

Result: The study successfully shows that short-range repulsion stabilizes a layer-pseudospin skyrmion lattice in rhombohedral graphene multilayers, leading to the formation of an effective magnetic field and a Chern band, thereby establishing the real-space origin of interaction-driven topology in moiré rhombohedral graphene.

Conclusion: This research provides significant insights into the real-space mechanism behind interaction-driven topology in moiré rhombohedral graphene and suggests potential applications in understanding skyrmion lattice dynamics and topology in other materials.

Abstract: We introduce an ideal limit of rhombohedral graphene multilayers. In this limit, we show analytically how short-range repulsion stabilizes a layer-pseudospin skyrmion lattice, which generates an effective magnetic field and gives rise to a Chern band. This establishes the real-space origin of interaction-driven topology in moiré rhombohedral graphene. The resulting interaction-induced skyrmion lattice is physically analogous to magnetic skyrmion crystals and hosts a hierarchy of collective excitations naturally described within the framework of skyrmion-lattice dynamics.

Abstract: This investigation is a rigorous theoretical study of the Single Differential Cross Section (SDCS) for the ionization of hydrogen in the 3s state by electron impact computed by means of the First-Born Approximation. The transition matrix has been found by means of the integral process of Bethe-Lewis. The effect of the Coulomb attractive force and the continuum of outgoing radiation have been taken into account in conjunction with the hypergeometric function, which has been used to denote the states of collision. It has hence been possible to deduce the SDCS. for a considerable range of respective incoming electron energies (100 eV to 250 eV). The results show a very distinct marked peak in the rate of ionization taking place for these energies (about 200 eV) with a gradual fall-off after with an increase in energy. The diffuse structure of the wave function in the 3s state serves to a certain extent to make variations in the rate of ionization with that of the incoming electron increased. The final results have been arrived at by means of numerical integrations done so by means of a MATLAB computer, which has yielded very accurate numbers for the cross sections. The results show up very fatally, with experimental results existing at the present date and with theoretical deductions validating the procedure of the FBA. in giving the results of the ionization of excited hydrogen atoms within the field of ionizing processes of electron-atom impact systems. The work gives a most complete basis for the further study of those systems where the processes of ionization and the complexities of the scattering process take place in excited states.

Abstract: We measure the time-dependent temperature and density distribution of antiprotons and positrons while slowly combining them to make antihydrogen atoms in a nested Penning-Malmberg trap. The total antihydrogen yield and the number of atoms escaping the trap as a beam are greatest when the positron temperature is lowest and when antiprotons enter the positron plasma at the smallest radius. We control these parameters by changing the rate at which we lower the electrostatic barrier between the antiproton and positron plasmas and by heating the positrons. With the optimal settings, we produce $2.3\times 10^6$ antihydrogen atoms per $15$-minute run, surpassing the previous state of the art -- $3.1\times 10^4$ atoms in $4$ minutes -- by a factor of $20$.

Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy on the $A^2Π$ - $X^2Σ^+$ electronic system of $^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F is performed using a cold molecular beam produced by a buffer gas source. The hyperfine structure in both $X^2Σ^+$ ground and $A^2Π$ excited states is fully resolved and absolute transition frequencies of individual components are measured at the sub-MHz level making use of frequency-comb laser calibration. Sets of molecular constants for the $X^2Σ^+$($v=0,1$) and $A^2Π$($v=0,1$) levels are determined, with improved accuracy for the $T_{v',v''}$ band origins and spin-orbit interaction constants for the $A^2Π$ excited states, that represent the presently measured highly accurate transitions for low-$J$ states as well as previously determined transition frequencies in Fourier-transform emission studies for rotational levels as high as $J \geq 100$. The extracted molecular constants reproduce the measured transition frequencies at the experimental absolute accuracy of 1 MHz. The work is of relevance for future laser cooling schemes, and is performed in the context of a measurement of the electron dipole moment for which BaF is a target system.

Abstract: One of the main residual limitations of inertial sensors based on atom interferometry stems from laser beam distortions, which cause parasitic phase shifts and non-homogeneous matter-light couplings. Here we present numerical simulations, accompanied by analytical calculations, which quantify the impact of these effects in a cold atom gradiometer. We demonstrate that the propagation of interferometric laser beam aberrations, combined with initial asymmetry and significant time-of-flight expansion of the the two atomic sources, limit the common-mode rejection of phase noise in a differential configuration. The resulting deviations in gravitational acceleration and its gradient are within reach of current experimental devices. Our study allows us to evaluate the surface quality requirements for retroreflective optics in cold-atom gradiometers of various baselines, and can be extended to other sensors based on different interferometer geometries.

Abstract: We present the results obtained by applying, in real-time, a correction method to precisely synchronize a time base generated from a free-running atomic clock with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The method uses the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to have regular time comparisons between the atomic clock generated time base and the GPS Time, perform linear fits of the measurements and extrapolate a correction to apply to the free-running signal. In this work, we apply for the first time this method in real-time. Two atomic clocks were tested, a low-cost Rubidium clock and a more expensive magnetic Caesium clock. We demonstrate that we can obtain a residual difference between the clock time base and the French official realization of UTC (UTC(OP)) in the range of $\pm 15$ ns with no apparent residual drift.

Motivation: MOND 理论长期以来对引力问题的解释缺乏严格理论基础，尤其是其在广域天体如星系中的现象学成功常被暗物质解释。该论文尝试通过 Relativistic MOND 与 entropic 引力框架，为 MOND 提供理论基础，填补这一理论空白。

Conclusion: 该研究为 MOND 的 Relativistic 解释提供了新的理论框架，可能成为理解引力问题的有效途径之一。

Abstract: We derive a relativistic extension of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) within the framework of entropic gravity by introducing temperature-dependent corrections to the equipartition law on a holographic screen. Starting from a Debye-like modification of the surface degrees of freedom and employing the Unruh relation between acceleration and temperature, we obtain modified Einstein equations in which the geometric sector acquires explicit thermal corrections. Solving these equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime in the weak-field, low-temperature regime yields a corrected metric that smoothly approaches Minkowski space at large radii and naturally contains a characteristic acceleration scale. In the very-low-acceleration regime, the model reproduces MOND-like deviations from Newtonian dynamics while providing a relativistic underpinning for that phenomenology. We confront the theory with rotation-curve data for NGC~3198 and perform a Bayesian parameter inference, comparing our relativistic MOND (RMOND) model with both a baryons-only Newtonian model and a dark-matter halo model. We find that RMOND and the dark-matter model both fit the data significantly better than the baryons-only Newtonian prediction, and that RMOND provides particularly improved agreement at $r\gtrsim 20\,\mathrm{kpc}$. These results suggest that temperature-corrected entropic gravity provides a viable relativistic framework for MOND phenomenology, motivating further observational tests, including gravitational lensing and extended galaxy samples.

Motivation:  exploring novel gravitational phenomena in early universe physics and high-energy physics scenarios through chiral neutrino currents. The abstract delves into advanced theoretical physics concepts, highlighting the potential for chiral currents to influence gravitational behavior uniquely. This suggests a promising direction for understanding fundamental interactions and their geometric properties. The work also hints at applications in high-energy astrophysics, providing a deeper insight into neutrino-rich environments and their effects on spacetime structure. The introduction of Ricci-flow-inspired methods adds a modern mathematical tool to tackle these complex physical systems. This research could redefine our understanding of how neutrino currents shape the gravitational landscape, offering new perspectives for future theoretical explorations. The abstract's focus on coherent effects and topological invariants suggests a high level of precision and depth in the analysis. Furthermore, the identification of purely torsional mechanisms, independent of curvature, opens up new avenues for studying gravitational interactions without relying on traditional curvature-based frameworks. The significance lies in the potential to develop new theories that explain gravitational behavior in novel ways, particularly in extreme conditions like those in the early universe or high-energy astrophysical events. This work also raises questions about the interplay between geometry and particle physics, inviting further investigation into how these two fundamental aspects of physics are interconnected. The detailed exploration of Skyrmionic domains and non-orientable bridges suggests the presence of complex topological structures that could have far-reaching implications in both theoretical and applied physics. Overall, this abstract presents a compelling case for the importance of considering torsional effects in gravitational theories, offering a fresh angle for understanding neutrino-rich environments and their impact on spacetime structure. The language and concepts used indicate a high level of technical expertise, reflecting the advanced nature of the research and its potential contributions to the field. The study of these specific configurations may lead to breakthroughs in interpreting gravitational phenomena that are currently beyond our observational capabilities. The abstract's focus on establishing a framework for analyzing chiral currents' effects on gravity underscores the importance of such studies in advancing our theoretical understanding of the universe's most fundamental forces.

Method: The study employs Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation methods to analyze the behavior of chiral Majorana neutrino currents in linearized gravity. This approach allows the researchers to systematically explore the evolution of metric perturbations and their stabilization by chiral sources while maintaining negligible curvature invariants. By introducing a Ricci-flow-inspired method, the abstract suggests the use of advanced differential geometry tools to understand the dynamics of gravitational fields in the presence of chiral neutrino currents.

Result: Key findings include the stabilization of globally non-trivial torsional holonomy by topological invariants associated with the fundamental groups π₁(S¹) and π₃(S³). This suggests that the chiral currents induce robust geometric effects that are resistant to perturbations. Additionally, the emergence of Skyrmionic domains under one-chirality dominance indicates a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism that could play a role in phase transitions involving neutrino fields. The Moebius-type non-orientable bridges between opposite-chirality regions point to potential topological defects or connections that could influence the overall geometry of the system. In the static limit, the Green-function formulation provides a finite-range Yukawa-type response governed by the neutrino coherence length. This result implies that the influence of coherent chiral currents can extend beyond local curvature effects, offering a new perspective on how neutrino fields can impact gravitational behavior. The findings highlight the importance of considering torsional effects in gravitational theories, suggesting that these effects may dominate over curvature in certain neutrino-rich environments.

Conclusion: This research opens up new avenues for understanding how chiral Majorana neutrino currents can influence gravitational behavior through purely torsional mechanisms. By introducing Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation, the study provides a novel framework for analyzing the interplay between neutrino fields and spacetime geometry. The identification of Skyrmionic domains and non-orientable bridges suggests rich potential for exploring new topological structures in gravitational theories. The static Green-function results offer a finite-range response governed by the neutrino coherence length, indicating that coherent chiral currents can have significant gravitational effects even in the absence of local curvature. Overall, this work provides a deeper insight into the fundamental nature of neutrino-rich environments and their impact on spacetime structure, paving the way for future studies in theoretical physics and high-energy astrophysics.

Abstract: We investigate stationary torsional configurations supported by chiral Majorana neutrino currents in linearized gravity. A Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation (with no physical time interpretation) is introduced to drive the metric perturbation toward fixed points sustained by chiral sources while keeping curvature invariants negligible. We show that divergence-free chiral currents can support globally non-trivial torsional holonomy stabilized by topological invariants associated with the fundamental groups pi1(S1) and pi3(S3). Toroidal skyrmionic domains emerge when one chirality dominates, whereas a chiral-flip interference sector enables Moebius-type non-orientable bridges between opposite-chirality regions. In the static limit, a Green-function formulation provides a finite-range Yukawa-type response governed by the neutrino coherence length. These results identify a purely torsional mechanism, independent of local curvature, through which coherent chiral currents may influence effective gravitational behavior in neutrino-rich environments.

Conclusion: 这是第一个研究DSR修正后的双粒子方程的模型，表明DSR修正会导致束缚态能级的偏移，为后续研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: This study investigates a modified two-body Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, inspired by Amelino-Camelia's doubly special relativity (DSR). We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant αbehaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \(α_{eff(E)}/α\approx 1 - \frac{E}{4E_p}\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied. This model is the first of its kind, opening new avenues for further research in this area.

Motivation: 该研究旨在探讨量子场论中的迹异Navатор如何影响强 cosmic censorship，这是 Einstein 度量和时空结构的关键问题。通过二维缩约的分析，研究者表明迹异Navator能够通过能量增长和视界变化，修复内视界和奇点问题。

Method: 基于四维 Einstein–Maxwell 理论和 $N$ 个共形场的二维缩约，研究者分析了迹异Navator 引发的有限能量和指数增长的能量分布，从而推导出柯西视界的性质变化。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了量子效应在时空结构演化中的关键作用，特别是在修正奇点和视界性质方面。这为理解 Einstein 理论中的 cosmic censorship 定律提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly of quantum field theory is sufficient to enforce strong cosmic censorship in any stationary spacetime with an inner horizon of nonzero surface gravity. In the two-dimensional dilaton reduction of four-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal fields, the anomaly-induced Polyakov term yields a finite $\langle T_{vv}\rangle \to \frac{N}{48π}κ_-^2$ near the Cauchy horizon, while the affine-frame energy grows as $T_{kk}\propto e^{2κ_- v}$. The resulting tidal blow-up converts the inner horizon into a null, Tipler--strong singularity. The mechanism is local, universal, and state-independent, and extends to Kerr/Kerr--Newman, $Λ>0$, and nonsingular interiors. Thus, the trace anomaly is the minimal quantum ingredient restoring strong cosmic censorship.

Conclusion: Symmetry violation offers a detectable signature, with future detectors expected to measure these effects accurately.

Abstract: We investigate the potential for current and future gravitational-wave detectors to observe imprints of explicit diffeomorphism violation in primordial signals. Starting from a simple model with known effects, we derive the strain amplitude and power spectrum for primordial gravitational waves, both of which are affected by the symmetry breaking. Through this, we directly find predictions for the tensor spectral index and tensor-to-scalar which are different from general relativity. By considering the known sensitivity curves for NANOGrav, SKA, THEIA, $μ$-ARES, ASTROD-GW, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, AION-km, AEDGE, ET, and aLIGO, we place observability limits on the parameters controlling the diffeomorphism violation. For instance, we find that aLIGO could observe signals for \(s_{00} \lesssim -0.1\), while more sensitive future detectors like LISA and DECIGO could probe violations as small as \(s_{00} \approx -5 \times 10^{-4}\) and \(-3 \times 10^{-3}\), respectively. Finally, we consider the existing constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ which is tightly constrained by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, where we find that $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ only weakly depends on the symmetry breaking but places a lower bound on the coefficients which is consistent with available bounds from the speed of gravitational waves.

*P. A. G. Monteiro,C. J. A. P. Martins*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper discusses alternative theories to General Relativity aimed at explaining dark energy and the accelerated expansion of the universe, but these theories often fail empirical tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding dark energy and the universe's accelerated expansion is a major goal in physics. Current theories, like General Relativity, have limitations, so exploring alternatives is crucial.

Method: The authors examine extensions of Teleparallel Gravity and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity, evaluating their ability to replicate late-time acceleration and consistency with local gravity constraints through static, spherically symmetric solutions and Eddington parameter deviations.

Result: Some models reproduce the desired cosmological behavior but fail Solar System observational bounds, highlighting the need for a unified approach testing theories across cosmological and local scales.

Conclusion: The study concludes that while modified gravity theories show promise, they must pass both cosmological and local tests to be viable alternatives to General Relativity.

Abstract: The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe highlighted General Relativity's inability to naturally account for dark energy without invoking a finely tuned cosmological constant. In response, a wide range of alternative paradigms have been proposed. Among these, Teleparallel Gravity and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity, which depart from the Riemannian framework of General Relativity and instead rely on torsion or non-metricity to describe gravitational interactions, have gained increasing attention in recent years. We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions. We show that although some models can reproduce the desired cosmological behavior, they often fail to meet Solar System observational bounds, particularly through deviations in the predicted Eddington parameter. Our findings underscore the need for a unified approach that tests modified gravity theories across both cosmological and local scales.

Abstract: In this Letter, we have developed a numerically efficient framework for evaluating parameters in metric theories of gravity, and applied it to constrain the horizon-scale magnetic field in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) spacetime using the latest EHT observations. The method's adaptive ray-tracing strategy achieves near-linear computational efficiency without loss of numerical accuracy. Owing to this efficiency, the framework enables high precision shadow modeling at minimal computational cost and, for the first time, supports statistically robust inference of black hole parameters from horizon-scale observations for arbitrary stationary black holes. The above framework is applied to the recently obtained Kerr-BR black hole, an exact magnetized and rotating solution to the Einstein field equations. We have evaluated the horizon-scale magnetic fields of M87* and Sgr A*, with the latter showing a field strength of $93.3^{+14.7}_{-23.8}G$, consistent with the equipartition estimate of $71G$ from polarized ALMA observations, thereby supporting Einstein's gravity.

Abstract: A simple exact solution of the Einstein - Maxwell field equations for charged non-rotating black hole accelerated by an external electric field is presented. The background space-time, described by the well known Bertotti-Robinson solution, contains a spatially homogeneous electric field and possess the topology AdS2 x S2. The black hole mass m, its charge e and the value of the background electric field E are free parameters of the constructed solution. In the "rigid" (non-inertial) reference frame comoving a black hole, this solution is static. The value of acceleration of a black hole due to its interaction with the external electric field is determined by the condition of vanishing of conical singularities on the axis of symmetry. The dynamics of a charged black hole in the external electric field is compared with the behaviour of a charged test particle with the same charge to mass ratio.

Motivation: 研究对称共形平行引力在$f(Q)$理论中的宇宙学应用，旨在探索宇宙加速的机制。该理论提供了一种可能替代 $Λ$CDM 的框架，通过在早期和后期分别实现 inflation 和加速膨胀，解释宇宙学现象。

Abstract: The current paper reports an investigation of the cosmological implications of symmetric teleparallel gravity within a modified $f(Q)$ theory. We construct a specific exponential $f(Q)$ model as $f(Q) = Q + η_1 Q_0\left(1 - e^{-η_2 \sqrt{Q/Q_0}}\right)$, designed to smoothly deviate from General Relativity and accommodate both early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we constrain the model parameters $η_1$, $η_2$, $H_0$, and $Ω_{m_0}$ using a combination of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and Pantheon$^+$ Supernovae datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that the model consistently supports a late-time acceleration scenario and is in good agreement with current cosmological observations. We extensively analyze the dynamical behavior of the model using key cosmological diagnostics, including the deceleration parameter, equation of state, energy density parameters, Statefinder, and Om diagnostics. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $μ(z)$ show strong consistency with $Λ$CDM and observational data, while subtle deviations at higher redshifts highlight the value of multi-probe observations. In addition, the examination of energy conditions shows that, in accordance with cosmic acceleration, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is broken at lower redshifts while the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and Null Energy Condition (NEC) are satisfied. Cosmic age estimates from the model are consistently in agreement with Planck constraints. Our results indicate the viability of exponential $f(Q)$ gravity. A comparative statistical analysis reveals that while $Λ$CDM remains statistically preferred based on AIC and BIC criteria, the exponential $f(Q)$ model yields comparable fits and remains a theoretically motivated and viable alternative for describing cosmic acceleration.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an interacting scalar field dark energy model with an exponential potential and a dark sector coupling \( Q = 3γHρ_{dm} \), which has been observationally tested using recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 , Unanchored Type Ia Supernovae, and the compressed CMB likelihood. We find that the Interacting model predicts a Hubble constant of $h = 0.659 \pm 0.0063$, deviating from the $Λ$CDM value by approximately $2.93σ$, while the Non-Interacting model shows a $3.78σ$ deviation. The positive coupling parameter (\( γ> 0 \)) further suggests a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. According to the Jeffreys scale, the Interacting model shows moderate evidence against the $Λ$CDM model, whereas the Non-Interacting model shows only inconclusive evidence. Further, we investigate both models through the lens of dynamical systems analysis. We formulate the cosmological evolution equations with a phenomenological interaction term and recast them into an autonomous system to study the qualitative behavior of cosmic expansion. Critical points of the system are identified and analyzed to study the corresponding cosmological dynamics. In the interacting model, we obtained five critical points, whereas in the non-interacting scenario, four distinct sets of critical points were identified. The obtained critical points, governed by cosmological parameters, represent distinct cosmic epochs, commencing from the early time stiff matter domination to late-time acceleration. Their stability is examined through linear stability analysis under appropriate physical constraints. The evolution of background cosmological parameters are also examined in terms of the dynamical system variable, and the obtained values align with observational results.

Conclusion: -article introduces barriers and black regions, aiding horizon computation. 

Abstract: We prove that if S is a time-oriented null hypersurface of a Lorentzian n-manifold (M, g), the causal world-lines, which intersect transversally S and are time-oriented in a compatible way, cross the hypersurface all in the same direction, the other being forbidden. Even if it is known that a smooth event horizon (in the sense of Penrose, Hawking and Ellis) is a null hypersurface and has the above semi-permeability property, at the best of our knowledge, it was not known so far that the latter is a mere consequence of the former. Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes. Since barriers are defined by two simple properties -- the merely local property of "nullity" combined with the global property of "separating the space-time" -- we expect they may be used to simplify computations for locating static and/or dynamic horizons in numerical computations.

Abstract: In this paper, we apply numerical backward ray-tracing to study the observational appearance of Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) black holes illuminated by thin accretion disk flows. We obtained the inner shadow, redshift characteristics, and intensity distribution of thin-disk images of the KTN black hole, as observed by a common observer located at different positions. The results show that increasing the spin parameter progressively deforms the critical curve into a "D" shape while simultaneously shrinking and distorting the inner shadow. More importantly, for n = 0.3 at theta_o = 80 degrees, the inner shadow develops a novel "duck-cap-like" morphology with a sharply protruding lower-right edge beyond the critical curve. We term this feature the "extended inner shadow", a structure distinct from the Kerr case. Unlike the standard inner shadow, it consists partly of photons absorbed by the horizon and partly of photons that avoid both absorption and crossing the disk plane, thus receiving no emission. Such deviations from Kerr predictions could be tested by future high-precision astronomical observations, potentially offering new evidence for the existence of NUT charge (or the gravitomagnetic monopole) in black holes.

Conclusion: f(Q)引力在非极小耦合框架下表现出了一定的余学性质，并且可以通过不同的参数选择来缓解H0 拉锯战。研究表明，进一步探索与现有观测数据一致的扩展模型是有意义的。

Abstract: In this study, the cosmological implications of nonminimally coupled $f(Q)$ gravity are examined within the metric-affine formalism, in which the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ couples directly to the matter Lagrangian. Within the symmetric teleparallel framework, a representative $f(Q)$ model is constructed, and the corresponding background cosmological equations are derived. The analysis aims to test whether this geometric formulation yields more consistent realizations of nonminimal matter-geometry couplings. A comprehensive statistical MCMC analysis is performed using cosmic chronometers, DESI BAO DR2, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+, DESY5, and Union3 samples. To complement the statistical study, we employ machine learning methods, such as linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest algorithms, to evaluate the predictive performance and robustness of the data. The results indicate that a partial alleviation of the $H_0$ tension can be achieved for a broad range of parameter choices. Nonetheless, $f(Q)$ gravity emerges as a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, motivating further exploration of extended models consistent with all observations.

Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism where a first-order phase transition modulates the decay rate of a massive field. This modulation, even if the scalar field has negligible energy density, subsequently generates an observable stochastic gravitational-wave background. The stochastic nature of bubble nucleation leads to the asynchrony of phase transitions, generating superhorizon-scale density perturbations through spatial variations in the decay rate $Γ$. These perturbations subsequently source second-order gravitational waves with peak amplitudes governed by the phase transition parameter \(β/H_*\) and decay rate $Γ$.
  We apply this mechanism in the reheating scanario where the decay rate of inflaton are modulated by the scalar field that undergoes a first-order phase transition.
  Numerical calculations reveal that the gravitational wave energy spectrum typically reaches \(Ω_{\text{GW}} \sim 10^{-10}\), demonstrating prospects for detection by space-based interferometers like LISA, TianQin and Taiji.
  This work establishes a new approach to probe phase transition processes in the early Universe without requiring significant vacuum energy release.

Motivation: Examining inflationary models within modified gravity to understand their observational viability, particularly with upcoming missions like LiteBIRD & CMB-S4.

Method: Analyzes mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation using f(R, T) gravity framework. Calculates scalar spectral tilt, tensor-to-scalar ratio, and running of scalar spectral index, then plots these in the n_s-r plane.

Result: Results show that certain parameter spaces of these models are viable within current observational data (Planck, BICEP/Keck, DESI DR2, and ACT DR6).

Conclusion: Modified gravity theories, particularly these inflationary models, offer a promising avenue that remains consistent with current data.

Abstract: The advent of high-precision cosmological observations has challenged many traditional inflationary models. Data from $Planck$ 2018 along with the BICEP/$Keck$ 2018 result have already ruled out most of the established models by placing tight constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Upcoming missions like LiteBIRD & CMB-S4 are expected to impose an even more stringent bound on $r$ , potentially excluding further models from the viable landscape. In this evolving observational context, modified gravity theories offer a promising way to reconcile inflationary models with data. In this work, we explore several inflationary models, namely mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation, within the framework of $f(R, T)$ gravity. The cosmological observable parameters, viz. scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and running of scalar spectral index $n_{sk}$ are estimated for the three models, and their trajectories are plotted in the $n_s-r$ plane. The model results are evaluated in light of the $Planck$, BICEP/$Keck$, DESI DR2, and ACT DR6 data. We observe that for a certain model parameter space, these potentials are viable within the current observational bounds.

Abstract: We perform a long-duration Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave data to constrain the near-horizon geometry of black holes formed in binary mergers. Deviations from the Kerr geometry are parameterized by replacing the horizon's absorbing boundary with a reflective surface at a fractional distance epsilon. This modification produces long-lived monochromatic quasinormal modes that can be probed through extended integration times. Building on previous work that set a bound of log10(epsilon) = -23.5 for GW150914, we reproduce and validate those results and extend the analysis to additional events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. By combining posterior samples from multiple detections, we construct a joint posterior yielding a tightened 90 percent upper bound of log10(epsilon) < -27.12, demonstrating the statistical power of population-level inference through cumulative evidence. Finally, analyzing the newly observed high signal-to-noise ratio event GW250114 from the O4b run, we obtain the most stringent single-event constraint to date, log10(epsilon) < -29.58 (90 percent credible region). Our findings provide the strongest observational support to date for the Kerr geometry as the correct description of post-merger black holes, with no detectable horizon-scale deviations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} < H <1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.

Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $φ$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.

Abstract: We derive the approximate analytical solutions of the bound timelike geodesic orbits in the effective-one-body (EOB) frame with extreme-mass ratio limit. The analytical solutions are expressed in terms of the elliptic integrals using Mino time $λ$ as the independent variable. Since Mino time decouples the $r$ and $θ$-motion, we also give explicit expressions for three orbital frequencies $Ω_r, ~Ω_θ, ~Ω_φ$ using the Fourier series expansion. With these analytical expressions at hand, we can perform Fourier expansions in Mino time $λ$ for any function expressed in terms of the coordinates $(r,θ,φ)$. In particular, the observer's time t is decomposed into Mino time $λ$, and the frequency-domain description is constructed from the $λ$-Fourier expansion and the expansion of t. These analytical expressions are quite simple to implement, and can be applicable for calculating gravitational waves (GWs) from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with the frequency-domain Teukolsky equation.

### [73] [Force-free Electrodynamics in Arbitrary Geometries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06693)
*Rakshak Adhikari*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for solving Force-Free Electrodynamics equations in various spacetimes using a foliation approach. The method extends previous successes in Kerr and FLRW metrics and introduces new solutions with dynamic electromagnetic fields evolving between dominated regimes. It also constructs vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the need to model complex electromagnetic phenomena in extreme astrophysical environments, such as neutron stars and black holes, where traditional methods fall short due to the nonlinear nature of the force-free field equations.

Method: The authors introduce a novel foliation technique, leveraging the involutive distribution of the force-free field's kernel, which geometrically decomposes the problem. This method is extended beyond previous applications to Kerr and FLRW spacetimes, allowing the derivation of exact solutions in diverse metrics.

Result: The paper successfully derives new exact solutions for the force-free field in various spacetimes, including cases with partially undetermined metrics. It also introduces a novel class of solutions where electromagnetic fields transition between magnetic and electric dominance over time. Additionally, a method for constructing vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes is presented.

Conclusion: This work broadens the applicability of force-free electrodynamics, offering new insights into the dynamic evolution of electromagnetic fields in general relativistic astrophysical contexts. The foliation approach presents a promising framework for further exploration in high-magnetic environment studies.

Abstract: The dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in extreme astrophysical environments are effectively modeled by Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE), a framework essential for studying objects like neutron stars and accreting black holes. The inherently nonlinear nature of the FFE equations makes finding exact solutions a challenging task. This paper explores an innovative approach to solving these equations by foliating spacetime into two-dimensional surfaces, specifically tailored to the geometry of electromagnetic fields. The foliation approach exploits the fact that the kernel of the force-free field defines an involutive distribution, naturally lending itself to a geometric decomposition. This method has previously been applied with great success in Kerr and FLRW spacetimes. By extending this formalism, we develop new exact solutions to the FFE equations in several distinct spacetimes, including cases where the metric remains partially undetermined. Additionally, we present a novel class of solutions that smoothly transition between magnetically dominated and electrically dominated regimes over time. Finally, we construct a pair of vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes, further demonstrating the utility of the foliation approach. These results offer a new perspective on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic fields and their geometric underpinnings in various spacetime geometries, broadening the applicability of the framework for understanding the dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in general relativistic astrophysical contexts.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate a modified gravity framework where the geometric Einstein--Hilbert sector remains untouched while the matter Lagrangian is weighted by a nontrivial function $φ(T)$ of the energy--momentum trace. Unlike $f(R,T)$ or $f(R,\mathcal L_m)$ theories, this construction alters how matter curves spacetime without introducing extra geometric degrees of freedom, thereby remaining consistent with local tests of gravity. Physically, the factor $φ(T)\mathcal L_m$ can be interpreted as an effective renormalization of the matter sector, relevant at high densities and smoothly reducing to GR at low densities. Within this setup we identify a robust window in parameter space leading to a smooth and nonsingular cosmological bounce, with bounded density, finite $\dot H>0$ at the bounce, and preservation of the infrared limit where $Λ$CDM is recovered. This mechanism provides a natural route to singularity resolution while retaining the empirical successes of standard cosmology.

TL;DR: The exponential $f(R)$ gravity model extends GR with late-time dark energy and high-redshift matching. Using Bayesian MCMC with neutrino data, they constrain model parameters, finding it consistent with $m{/Lambda}CDM$ but slightly alleviating some tensions. Constraints on neutrino masses are tighter than in other models.

Motivation: This paper modifies gravity to explore dark energy and neutrino physics, offering a unified approach to cosmological tensions.

Method: BAYESIAN MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO analysis combining data from cosmic chronometers, DESI DR2 BAO, CMB, and supernovae.

Result: Model consistent with current observations, slightly alleviates Hubble and neutrino mass tensions, with tighter constraints on neutrino masses than alternative models.

Conclusion: Modified gravity and neutrino physics may jointly address cosmological tensions, warranting further study.

Abstract: The exponential $f(R)$ gravity model provides a theoretically well-motivated extension of General Relativity, introducing a modified gravitational dynamics at late times consistent with a dynamical dark energy scenario, while recovering the $Λ$CDM-like regime at high redshifts with a smooth transition. Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we constrain the parameters of the exponential $f(R)$ model in combination with the total neutrino mass $\sum m_ν$, employing the latest measurements from cosmic chronometers, the DESI DR2 BAO data, the CMB acoustic scale, and the Pantheon+ supernovae compilation, comparing the results with the $Λ$CDM and the $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our results show that the exponential $f(R)$ model remains consistent with current observations while slightly alleviating the Hubble tension and the neutrino mass problem relative to $Λ$CDM, although the constraints on $\sum m_ν$ are tighter than those obtained for the phenomenological $w_0w_a$CDM scenario. These results indicate that the interplay between modified gravity and neutrino physics in the late Universe may offer a viable framework for further investigation of cosmological tensions.

### [76] [On the Validity of the Background Subtraction Method for Black Hole Thermodynamics in Matter-Coupled Gravity Theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07209)
*Yong Xiao,Aonan Zhang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The background subtraction method and the Iyer-Wald formalism produce equivalent results even in theories that include matter fields. However, care must be taken in specific scenarios depending on the properties of the matter fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the relationship between background subtraction and the Iyer-Wald formalism is essential for accurately computing thermodynamic properties of black holes in diverse physical theories.

Method: The researchers compared the results of the background subtraction method and the Iyer-Wald formalism in matter-coupled theories. They applied these methods to two representative examples and also identified potential issues in specific scenarios.

Result: In both examined theories, the background subtraction method provided accurate results. However, additional care is needed in cases where certain matter field properties might complicate the calculations.

Conclusion: The equivalence between the background subtraction method and the Iyer-Wald formalism holds even in the presence of matter fields, yet it's crucial to consider the unique characteristics of the matter fields in different scenarios.

Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer-Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer-Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.

*Jiaqi Wang,Yang Xu,Saumya Choudhary,Omid Mozafar,Robert Boyd*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper discusses the use of transverse grid beam structures to suppress self-focusing in Kerr media, enabling higher power transmission without damage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the problem of self-focusing in high-power laser beams, which can cause significant damage to optical components. Suppression of self-focusing is an important goal in the field of laser physics and directed-energy applications.

Method: The researchers propose a transverse grid beam structure and analyze its effects using nonlinear interactions between beamlets. They derive a dimension-dependent multi-stage self-focusing phenomenon and identify optimal grid layouts for power transmission.

Result: The proposed beam structure effectively suppresses self-focusing, allowing higher power transmission without damage. The paper identifies specific grid layouts that enhance transmitted power beyond the critical self-focusing level.

Conclusion: The results suggest that beam shaping techniques, such as transverse grid structures, can prevent material damage caused by self-focusing in high-powered laser beams, with potential applications in advanced optical and directed-energy systems.

Abstract: Laser beams with high optical power propagating in a Kerr medium can undergo self-focusing when their power exceeds a critical power determined by the optical properties of the medium. The highly concentrated energy close to the in the region of the self-focus can lead to other nonlinear phenomena and cause significant irreversible damage to the material. We propose a transverse grid beam structure that effectively suppresses self-focusing even in the absence of other competing effects through the redistribution of optical power by inter-beamlet nonlinear interaction. We find that a beam with a $N \times N$ grid structure with optimized lattice spacing undergoes a dimension-dependent multi-stage self-focusing. We also identify specific grid layouts that can increase the total transmitted power beyond that permitted by the critical level of self-focusing for each beamlet. Lastly, we derive a general numerical relation between the optimal grid lattice spacing and the size of beamlets. Our results could potentially inform the use of beam shaping to prevent damage to optical components in high-powered and directed-energy applications.

Abstract: Silicon nitride microresonators have become an ubiquitous platform for cutting-edge photonics applications. Improvement in silicon nitride fabrication techniques, providing ultra-high quality-factor values up to $10^7$, has opened up new possibilities for nonlinear effects realizations in such structures. Here we report for the first time to our knowledge on the observation of the Stokes microcombs in silicon nitride on-chip microresonators exhibiting normal group velocity dispersion. Moreover, using different pump schemes, namely, a tunable laser with an isolator and a stabilized diode laser, we demonstrate on-chip stimulated Raman frequency combs including dark-pulse Raman states. We reveal a complex interplay between Kerr and Raman nonlinearities and elaborate effective method of controllable switching between predominantly Kerr-comb and predominantly Raman-comb operation. We prove the Raman-induced platicon formation by numerical model which shows perfect agreement with experimental results. These findings are of special importance for silicon nitride photonics and provide a basis for novel photonic devices.

Abstract: High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging as key enablers of future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), supporting gigabit-class free-space optical (FSO) backhaul links while hosting laser-based sensing payloads. This tutorial and survey reviews recent advances in HAPS optical communication and integration with atmospheric remote sensing via shared optical links. Among several sensing techniques, Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) is identified as most promising due to its range-resolved sensitivity, spectral selectivity, and compatibility with HAPS constraints. A roadmap is outlined for implementing telecom-band DIAL on HAPS alongside high-throughput FSO systems. The paper analyzes architectural and atmospheric advantages of HAPS over terrestrial and satellite nodes, emphasizing spatial-temporal coverage, station-keeping ability, and support for compact laser payloads such as DIAL, in-situ sensors, and multispectral imagers. It highlights the feasibility of co-locating sensing and communication within a shared optical and power envelope, especially in the telecom C-band (1.53-1.57 um), enabling trace-gas retrieval (CO2, CH4, N2O, H2S, O3) while maintaining multi-Gbps downlinks. Suitable HAPS architectures (balloons, UAVs, airships) and use cases are identified where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled HAPS outperform satellites and UAVs, including greenhouse gas monitoring, disaster response, air-quality mapping, and 6G NTN extensions. A literature survey for 2005-2025 shows HAPS publications have tripled since 2014, indicating rapid growth. The results confirm that optical hardware, favorable transmission windows, and active R&D are positioning HAPS as a persistent stratospheric layer for 6G ISAC communications and environmental observation.

Abstract: Optical links and knots have attracted growing attention owing to their exotic topologic features and promising applications in next-generation information transfer and storage. However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications.

Abstract: The 1.8-2.3 μm band lies within the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region and serves as a key operational window for a wide range of applications, including quantum sensing, molecular spectroscopy, and free-space quantum and classical optical communication. Despite its significance, optical devices operating in this band still face two major challenges: chromatic aberration across the wide spectral range and the difficulty of integration due to bulky optical elements. Metalenses are composed of subwavelength nanostructures that locally control the phase and group delay of light, enabling precise wavefront shaping and broadband dispersion compensation. These capabilities make them highly promising for use in infrared optical systems, particularly in applications such as focusing and imaging for compact integrated devices. In this study, we propose a metalens design based on a CaF2 substrate, where each nanocell consists of a single-bar silicon structure. These nanocells are periodically arranged with a 900 nm period, enabling precise control of dispersion and phase. By systematically finetuning the bar length and width, the design enables simultaneous dispersion compensation and phase modulation, achieving stable focusing performance over a broad spectral range. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate that the metalens design achieves effective suppression of chromatic aberration in the 1800-2300 nm range, maintaining a stable focal position throughout the bandwidth with variation within 6% of the focal length. This design offers a compact, broadband, and high-performance approach for beam collimation and wavefront shaping in the SWIR band, with promising potential for applications in quantum communication and sensing systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture imaging has enabled breakthrough observations from radar to astronomy. However, optical implementation remains challenging due to stringent wavefield synchronization requirements among multiple receivers. Here we present the multiscale aperture synthesis imager (MASI), which utilizes parallelism to break complex optical challenges into tractable sub-problems. MASI employs a distributed array of coded sensors that operate independently yet coherently to surpass the diffraction limit of single receiver. It combines the propagated wavefields from individual sensors through a computational phase synchronization scheme, eliminating the need for overlapping measurement regions to establish phase coherence. Light diffraction in MASI naturally expands the imaging field, generating phase-contrast visualizations that are substantially larger than sensor dimensions. Without using lenses, MASI resolves sub-micron features at ultralong working distances and reconstructs 3D shapes over centimeter-scale fields. MASI transforms the intractable optical synchronization problem into a computational one, enabling practical deployment of scalable synthetic aperture systems at optical wavelengths.

TL;DR: A new method is proposed for creating gaseous diffractive optical elements (DOEs) by imprinting an entropy mode, eliminating the need for acoustic oscillations. This allows for improved control over the element's lifetime, diffraction angles, and enables the creation of arbitrary, non-periodic structures such as chirped gratings or lenses with varying laser pulse durations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The existing methods for gaseous DOEs rely on complex setups involving simultaneous excitation of acoustic waves and entropy modes, which impose strict constraints on the device's operational parameters. This new approach aims to simplify and improve upon these limitations.

Method: The method involves imprinting an entropy mode directly onto the gas, avoiding the need for generating and coupling with acoustic oscillations. This simplifies the setup and potentially enhances the device's performance and stability.

Result: By eliminating the acoustic oscillations, the researchers were able to create gaseous DOEs with better-defined diffraction angles, greater contrast, and the ability to form non-periodic structures. The devices are also compatible with a wider range of laser pulse durations, from femtoseconds to microseconds.

Conclusion: This breakthrough simplifies the creation of gaseous DOEs, making them more versatile and robust, and opens new possibilities for applications in areas such as optical data storage, sensing, and ultrafast optics.

Abstract: We propose a novel class of gaseous diffractive optical elements created by imprinting an entropy mode in a gas. Previous approaches to gaseous diffractive optics relied on the simultaneous excitation of a standing acoustic wave and an entropy mode to produce one-dimensional periodic structures. However, the presence of acoustic oscillations in the gas imposes stringent constraints on some operational parameters of these optical elements, such as their lifetime and diffraction angle. In this work, we introduce a new approach that eliminates the acoustic mode, relying solely on the entropy mode. This enables control of the lifetime and temporal profile of gaseous optical elements, and also allows the creation of arbitrary structures with greater contrast, including non-periodic patterns such as chirped gratings or lenses. This approach should allow operation over a wider parameter space, including larger diffraction angles and compatibility with laser pulse durations ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds.

Conclusion: 该研究为结合傅里叶光学与超分辨率技术开辟了新途径，为更简单的实验设备奠定了基础。

Abstract: Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2π/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.

TL;DR: DART enables high-resolution molecular imaging using deep-UV spectroscopy and ptychography in a portable setup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for simultaneous high resolution, wide field, and molecular specificity in biological imaging led to the development of DART.

Method: DART uses lensless ptychographic microscopy and UV spectroscopy, combined with a virtual error-bin method to eliminate artifacts.

Result: DART achieves resolutions of 308 nm across cm² areas, with mm-scale depth of field and femtogram sensitivity.

Conclusion: DART provides a portable platform for applications in diagnostics, tissue analysis, and space exploration.

Abstract: The mesoscale characterization of biological specimens has traditionally required compromises between resolution, field-of-view, depth-of-field, and molecular specificity, with most approaches relying on external labels. Here we present the Deep-ultrAviolet ptychogRaphic pockeT-scope (DART), a handheld platform that transforms label-free molecular imaging through intrinsic deep-ultraviolet spectroscopic contrast. By leveraging biomolecules' natural absorption fingerprints and combining them with lensless ptychographic microscopy, DART resolves down to 308-nm linewidths across centimeter-scale areas while maintaining millimeter-scale depth-of-field. The system's virtual error-bin methodology effectively eliminates artifacts from limited temporal coherence and other optical imperfections, enabling high-fidelity molecular imaging without lenses. Through differential spectroscopic imaging at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths, DART quantitatively maps nucleic acid and protein distributions with femtogram sensitivity, providing an intrinsic basis for explainable virtual staining. We demonstrate DART's capabilities through molecular imaging of tissue sections, cytopathology specimens, blood cells, and neural populations, revealing detailed molecular contrast without external labels. The combination of high-resolution molecular mapping and broad mesoscale imaging in a portable platform opens new possibilities from rapid clinical diagnostics, tissue analysis, to biological characterization in space exploration.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  pushes the limits of ptychography for single-sensor high-throughput sensing of dynamic samples.

Method: Dual neural networks extract real and imaginary field components, avoiding phase discontinuities with a gradient-based loss.

Result: Centimeter-scale resolution with 308-nm linewidths, validated across various samples.

Conclusion: Demonstrates gigapixel video tractability with single-sensor measurements, enabling real-time monitoring of mesoscale dynamics.

Abstract: Achieving gigapixel space-bandwidth products (SBP) at video rates represents a fundamental challenge in imaging science. Here we demonstrate video-rate ptychography that overcomes this barrier by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations through neural field representations. Our approach factorizes the space-time volume into low-rank spatial and temporal features, transforming SBP scaling from sequential measurements to efficient correlation extraction. The architecture employs dual networks for decoding real and imaginary field components, avoiding phase-wrapping discontinuities plagued in amplitude-phase representations. A gradient-domain loss on spatial derivatives ensures robust convergence. We demonstrate video-rate gigapixel imaging with centimeter-scale coverage while resolving 308-nm linewidths. Validations span from monitoring sample dynamics of crystals, bacteria, stem cells, microneedle to characterizing time-varying probes in extreme ultraviolet experiments, demonstrating versatility across wavelengths. By transforming temporal variations from a constraint into exploitable correlations, we establish that gigapixel video is tractable with single-sensor measurements, making ptychography a high-throughput sensing tool for monitoring mesoscale dynamics without lenses.

*Hosna Sultana*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: Dielectric resonant metasurfaces can efficiently generate high harmonics, and this paper presents a Germanium metasurface for upconverted full-Stokes imaging at 1.33 μm using the third harmonic generation (THG) from a 4-μm fundamental wavelength. The TH conversion efficiency ranges from 1x10-5% to 5.6x10-3% for linear polarization and 1.3x10-4% to 6.1x10-2% for circular polarization. The metasurface design incorporates nanoantenna structures to analyze polarization states and exhibits intensity-dependent TH conversion with new harmonic generation. This is the first approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging using this metasurface design, which enables high-resolution thermal imaging with uncooled detectors at mid-infrared (MWIR) to SWIR. The metasurface integrates into infrared image upconversion, offering applications in surveillance and defense systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to develop efficient metasurfaces for high harmonic generation, particularly focusing on full-Stokes imaging in the mid-infrared. This has applications in advanced thermal imaging and surveillance systems, which require accurate and efficient heat signature identification.

Method: The paper describes the use of a Germanium metasurface designed with anisotropic cross-triangles nanoantennas. The method involves analyzing the THG process, measuring TH conversion efficiencies across different polarization states and intensity levels, and integrating the metasurface into infrared imaging systems. The design is optimized for polarization-dependent TH diffraction orders and orthogonal transmission to minimize losses.

Result: The results highlight a significant TH conversion efficiency range, demonstrating the metasurface's capability to convert fundamental wavelengths into higher harmonics effectively. The polarization and intensity-dependent responses are successfully measured and integrated into full-Stokes imaging. The integration into thermal imaging systems shows potential for high-resolution, uncooled imaging in surveillance and missile defense systems.

Conclusion: This paper presents a groundbreaking approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging using a Germanium metasurface integrated with polarization-analyzing nanoantennas. The high harmonic generation efficiency and polarization sensitivity provide a novel solution for mid-infrared thermal imaging, with broad applications in defense and surveillance technologies.

Abstract: Dielectric resonant metasurfaces can be utilized for efficient high harmonic generation, which has been explored here in this effort for a high-efficient Germanium metasurface for upconverted full-Stokes imaging at 1.33-micron wavelength by the third harmonic generation (THG) from the 4-micron fundamental wavelength. The internal TH conversion efficiency for the Ge film is about 1x10-5 % to 5.6x10-3 % and for the Ge-metasurface 1.5x10-4 % to 1.05x10-1 % for linearly polarized (LP) incidence, and 1.3x10-4 % to 6.1x10-2 % for circularly polarized (CP) incidence, for the optical intensity range 0.47 GW/cm2 to 16.8 GW/cm2 respectively. The effect of the Ge film height variation has been discussed and compared with transmission line theory for the nonlinear medium. The metasurface design pitch is suitably tuned for the anisotropic cross-triangles nanoantenna for analyzing the polarization states of the fundamental beam simultaneously. The effect of source intensity on TH conversion among the LP and CP states, flipping the nonlinear diffraction orders and incipient of new harmonics with intensity dependence and design limitations, has also been addressed. To my knowledge, with this type of metasurface design, this is the first approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging. The benefit will be upconverted polarimetry of MWIR at SWIR, where uncooled efficient detectors are available for high-resolution thermal imaging. This efficient Ge-metasurface is exempt from TH transmission loss due to the size effect of assigning a phase gradient for polarization-dependent TH diffraction order generation and orthogonal transmission disparity. Integration of this type of metasurface for infrared image upconversion will open new possibilities for intense heat signature identification, especially for target recognition in next-generation infrared homing devices in surveillance and missile defense systems.

Abstract: Twistronics, the study of moiré superlattices of twisted bilayer 2D materials creating nontrivial physical effects, has recently revolutionized diverse subjects from materials to optoelectronics, nanophotonics, and beyond. Here, breaking the reliance on materials, we present twistronics in higher-dimensional free space, where the twisted lattice is not a layer of 2D material but a 3D propagating light field with topological textures. Moiré structured light with a twist angle can generate a rich set of high-dimensional topologies, including skyrmionium bags, skyrmion bag superlattices, skyrmion clusters, and optical quasicrystals, with controllable symmetry. Many of these textures have not been reported before. Importantly, in contrast to prior moiré superlattices, our freespace optical moiré textures maintain their topologies over a long propagation distances, showing nondiffractive behavior and robustness against perturbations and obstacles. Our work unlocks higher dimensions to manipulate moiré photonics with high-capacity topologies to address modern challenges of robust information transfer and encryption.

Abstract: Integrated radio-frequency (RF) photonics plays a pivotal role in wireless communications, sensing, and radar due to its large intrinsic bandwidth, remote distribution capability, and compact footprint. However, despite significant advances in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), the practical deployment of these systems remains constrained by the bulky nature of essential RF components (e.g., bulky antennas, amplifiers, and cables), especially in covert, conformal, and space-constrained applications. To overcome these limitations, monolithic electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs), enabling miniaturized and synergistic integration of both RF and photonic components, are gaining notable attention. As a groundbreaking advancement, we demonstrate a novel photonic RF receiver that monolithically integrates a bow-tie antenna and a microring modulator on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. The chip innovatively leverages dual-resonance enhancement mechanism, RF resonance from the antenna and optical resonance from the microring, to significantly boost the RF-to-optical conversion efficiency. A record-high figure of merit (FOM) of 3.88 W-1/2 is achieved within a compact footprint of 2*1.7 mm2. As the first demonstrations, the integrated receiver is deployed in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, achieving centimeter-level radar ranging accuracy and 3.2 Gbps wireless communication capacity, as well as real-time video transmission function in moving scenarios. This seminal work paves a new way for covert, conformal, and miniaturized frontends in wireless communication and sensing applications, including body area networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed vacuum maglevs, and electronic warfare systems.

Abstract: The resolving ability of wide-field fluorescence microscopy is fundamentally limited by out-of-focus background owing to its low axial resolution, particularly for densely labeled biological samples. To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: In this paper, researchers successfully extend the bandwidth of self injection-locked soliton microcombs using an additional thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator coupled to the main microresonator. This modification allows stable operation beyond the original tuning limitations and increases the comb's spectral span to nearly 200 nm while maintaining high repetition rates (25 GHz) and noise resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling advanced microresonator-based optical frequency combs for industrial applications requires comprehending their generation mechanisms, modulation capabilities, and potential limitations. Achieving the desired spectral flexibility and high stability is crucial for practical implementations in various technological sectors.

Method: The researchers employ a theoretical model combined with experimental validation to address the limitations of self injection-locked soliton microcombs. By introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary resonator and engineering its hybridization with the main resonator, they expand the operational bandwidth and modify the comb's behavior for enhanced control.

Result: The proposed method significantly enhances the performance of soliton microcombs. The experimentally demonstrated combs have a near 200 nm spectral span and a 25 GHz repetition rate, while maintaining the noise suppression benefits of self injection locking. The additional degree of freedom provided by the coupled resonator architecture allows for independent control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency.

Conclusion: This work offers a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of soliton microcombs, paves the way for practical industrial applications in optical information processing and precision metrology, and opens new avenues for the development of advanced optical systems reliant on such combs.

Abstract: Soliton microcombs generated in optical microresonators are accelerating the transition of optical frequency combs from laboratory instruments to industrial platforms. Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology.

Abstract: Ultrafast permittivity modulation in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) media provides a pathway for real-time control of non-Hermitian photonic topology. We model ultrafast topological dynamics in an ITO/SiO$_2$/Ag multilayer supporting hybrid epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-plasmon modes. Using a time-dependent Drude-Lorentz permittivity for ITO and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, it is found that carrier relaxation with a 10-ps time constant redshifts the ENZ resonance from 490 to 525~nm and shifts the reflection-phase singularities across the angle--wavelength plane. The motion of these singularities corresponds to the displacement of exceptional points and a discrete change in the cumulative winding number. The transient Floquet-like band structure exhibits avoided crossings and Dirac-type dispersions driven by ENZ modulation. The results directly link picosecond-scale permittivity dynamics to quantized topological transitions in non-Hermitian photonic systems.

Abstract: A novel idea, Quantum Thermodynamic Transformation Optics (QTTO), is introduced in this article. This theoretical framework integrates the geometric formalism of transformation optics with the thermodynamic principles found in quantum dissipative systems. This concept goes beyond traditional coordinate transformations by affecting the distribution of quantum energy and entropy in a coherent thermodynamic manner as well as reshaping electromagnetic fields. By employing the thermofield dynamics approach, we establish new rules that show how local energy and entropy densities are influenced by the Jacobian determinant of the mapping. This indicates that when the geometry is compressed, it increases the generation of quantum energy and entropy density, while expansion has the opposite effect, all while adhering to the laws of conservation and the second law of thermodynamics.
  As a practical test, we reformulate the Casimir effect within this framework, yielding a continuous pressure law that connects the quantum and classical realms via a thermal weighting function. This relationship illustrates how both geometry and temperature jointly determine quantum pressure. Additionally, our numerical results for Drude-Lorentz metamaterials support our analytical predictions and align closely with the comprehensive Lifshitz-Matsubara formulation. In fact, QTTO offers a powerful and coherent platform for exploring energy, entropy, and quantum pressure in real-world dissipative media. Beyond our immediate findings, it opens up a systematic pathway for managing quantum thermal processes and controlling field fluctuations in metamaterials and curved optical environments.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics can be used to break time reversal symmetry and is important for interactions in a wide range of systems, from active matter and neural networks to metamaterials and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In integrated photonic devices, non-Hermitian physics can be used for direction-dependent light propagation, reconfigurable light paths, selective energy localization and optical isolators. In this work, we report previously unexplored direction-dependent mode splitting in ring microresonators, achieved by adding multiple scatterers around the cavity. Through experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we unveil the underlying physics that changes the resonance shapes in resonant systems with backscattering. By engineering the spatial configuration of the scatterers, we can produce a predictable and repeatable direction-dependent mode splitting, enabling new ways to route light through optical resonators and photonic networks. In addition, the direction dependent mode-splitting can be used for precise near-field measurements, enhancing traditional sensing in integrated photonic chips.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to overcome the restriction of geometric phase metasurfaces being limited to circularly polarized light, thereby expanding their application to linearly polarized light which dominates modern optics.

Method: The method involves utilizing exceptional points in non-Hermitian physics to engineer singularities that can directly impart a geometric phase to linearly polarized light. This was experimentally demonstrated using gratings and holograms.

Result: The result is the successful demonstration of broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which cannot be achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. This opens new possibilities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces represent a significant breakthrough in the field of optics, offering new opportunities for advanced optical systems and applications by combining geometric phase manipulation with non-Hermitian photonics.

Abstract: The geometric phase is a universal concept in modern physics and has enabled the development of metasurfaces for versatile wavefront shaping. However, its realization in metasurfaces has been restricted to circularly polarized light, confining geometric phase metasurfaces to helicity-dependent operation and excluding them from the linear-polarization domain that dominates modern optics. In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. By revealing an intrinsic connection between geometric phase and non-Hermitian photonics, our work resolves a long-standing theoretical impasse and establishes a new framework for high-dimensional light control, opening opportunities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics.

Abstract: Random lasers (RL) emit light through multiple scattering in disordered gain media, typically resulting in isotropic emission with limited directionality control. Controlling RL emission direction in compact systems remains a challenge. Here we report directional random lasing achieved by infiltrating dye-doped nematic liquid crystals into a nanostructured silica metasurface. By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating. Our system demonstrates wide-angle RL beam steering at submicron scale without complex external components. These results provide a straightforward method to control RL emission directionality, advancing tunable coherent light sources and metasurface-based photonic applications.

Abstract: Designing large-scale metasurfaces with nonlocal optical effects remains challenging due to the immense dimensionality and fabrication constraints of conventional optimization methods. We introduce GiBS (Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures), an inverse-design framework that represents the entire device using a compact set of coefficients from smooth parametric bases such as Fourier or Chebyshev functions. This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity. The inherent smoothness of the basis functions ensures manufacturability while capturing the asymmetry required for nonlocal optical interactions. We experimentally validated the framework through the realization of a PEDOT:PSS broadband scattering metasurface, whose measured response closely matched full-wave simulations across 500-1100 nm. These results establish GiBS as a scalable, data-efficient, and fabrication-aware platform for the inverse design of multifunctional metasurfaces, bridging AI-guided representation learning with experimentally realizable photonic architectures.

Abstract: We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.

Abstract: We design an atomtronic filter device that spatially separates the components of a two-component Fermi gas with repulsive contact interactions in a two-dimensional geometry. With the aid of density--potential functional theory (DPFT), which can accurately simulate Fermi gases in realistic settings, we propose and characterize a barbell-shaped trapping potential, where a bridge-shaped potential connects two ring-shaped potentials. In the strongly repulsive regime, each of the ring traps eventually stores one of the fermion species. Our simulations are a guide to designing component filters for initially mixed, weakly repulsive spin components. We demonstrate that the functioning of this barbell design is robust against variations in experimental settings, for example, across particle numbers, for small deformations of the trap geometry, or if interatomic interactions differ from the bare contact repulsion. Our investigation marks the first step in establishing DPFT as a comprehensive simulation framework for fermionic atomtronics.

Abstract: We report the observation of a broad magnetic Feshbach resonance with a large background scattering length in an ultracold fermionic mixture of $^{23}$Na$^{40}$K molecules and $^{40}$K atoms, with both species prepared in their lowest hyperfine states. The Feshbach resonance is characterized by measuring resonantly enhanced loss rates and elastic scattering cross sections via cross-species thermalization. The large background scattering length can drive the atom-molecule mixture into the hydrodynamic regime when the magnetic field is far from the resonance. We observe that the center-of-mass motions of the atoms and molecules are phase-locked and oscillate with a common frequency due to hydrodynamic drag effects. This broad atom-molecule Feshbach resonance with its large background scattering length opens up a new avenue towards studying strongly interacting fermionic gases with mass imbalance.

Abstract: Dipoles in triangular optical ladders constitute a flexible platform for the study of the interplay between geometric frustration and long-range anisotropic interactions, and in particular for the observation of the spontaneous onset of chirality. Frustration magnifies the effect of the dipolar interactions in itinerant polarized dipolar bosons. As a result, the dipole-induced transition between a chiral superfluid and a non-chiral two-component superfluid may be observed for current state-of-the-art temperatures even for the weak inter-site interaction characterizing magnetic atoms in standard optical lattices. On the other hand, pinned spin-$1/2$ dipoles, which we discuss in the context of polar molecules in two rotational states, realize frustrated dipolar XXZ spin models. By controlling the external electric field strength and orientation, these systems can explore a rich ground-state landscape including chiral and nematic phases, as well as intriguing chiral dynamics.

Motivation: Understanding nonlinear pattern formation in ultracold atom systems is crucial for advancing quantum simulations and exploring complex many-body physics. This research provides new insights into controlling such patterns through external modulations.

Method: The researchers used analytical methods (modifying the Mathieu equation), numerical simulations (time-dependent mean-field), and a reduced five-mode model to study the system's behavior under bichromatic driving.

Result: The study reveals how bichromatic driving affects the stability of the condensate, leading to specific density wave modulations. They observed resonance tongue structures that dictate the instability's onset and selective mode enhancement. The results are validated by simulations and a reduced model, showing agreement in the nonlinear stage.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the versatility of bichromatic driving in generating and controlling complex nonlinear patterns in ultracold atom systems, which are accessible in current experimental setups.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.

TL;DR: This paper explains local acoustic metamaterials, their equi-frequency contours, and their effective properties for scatterers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper motivates the study of acoustic metamaterials by demonstrating their dispersion properties and applications in scattering.

Method: Mathematical analysis of EFCs as conics and quadrics, exploration of Willis coupling, causality considerations, scattering problem solutions using transition layers.

Result: EFCs are conics/quadrics, Willis coupling doesn't change their shape, finite-difference time-domain computations validate predictions with Drude layers achieving 2% accuracy.

Conclusion: Acoustic metamaterials can be used for precise scattering predictions with simple models when Drude layers are utilized.

Abstract: In this paper, we elucidate the concept of local acoustic metamaterials. These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.

Abstract: Interpreting the impedance response of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is challenging due to the complex coupling of ionic and electronic motion. While drift-diffusion (DD) modelling is a reliable method, its mathematical complexity makes directly extracting physical parameters from experimental data infeasible. This work uses DD modelling to generate a large synthetic dataset of impedance spectra for a standard TiO2/MAPI/spiro configuration. This dataset trains machine learning (ML) models to predict recombination and ionic parameters from impedance measurements. A Gradient Boosting Regressor, using features from a generalized equivalent circuit, showed the best performance. Interpretative analysis indicates open-circuit impedance experiments best probe recombination losses, while short-circuit conditions are more adequate for extracting ionic features like concentrations and mobilities. The trained ML models were tested on experimental spectra, confirming the inferred physical parameters could reproduce the data. For the studied configuration, predicted ion concentrations were (1.3-3.3) 10^17 cm-3, ion mobilities were (5-7) 10^-11 cm2V-1s-1, and surface recombination velocities were 7-9 and 23-35 m/s. This approach provides insights into the physical information extractable from impedance measurements and paves the way for ML models to unambiguously derive efficiency-determining parameters for solar cells.

Abstract: Voids are one of the many material defects present at the microscopic length scale. They are primarily responsible for the formation of cracks and hence contribute to ductile fracture. Circular voids tend to deform into elliptical voids just before their coalescence to form cracks. The principle aim of this study is to investigate the effect of void shape on the micro-mechanism of void growth by using Discrete Dislocation Plasticity simulations. For voided crystals, conventional DDP produces a continuous slip step throughout the material even if a dislocation escapes from a non-convex domain. To overcome this issue, the Extended Finite Element Method (XFEM) is used here to incorporate the displacement discontinuity. Different aspect ratios of elliptical voids are considered under uniaxial and biaxial deformation boundary conditions. The results suggest that voids having the largest surface area tend to have maximum growth rate as compared to void with lower surface area, i.e. "larger is faster". Under biaxial loading, a higher magnitude of strain hardening, and void growth rate are observed as compared to uniaxial loading. The results also suggest that the orientation of slip planes as well as voids, affect the overall plastic behavior of the voided-ductile material. Furthermore, circular void tends to induce minimum growth rate but have the maximum strain hardening effect as compared to other void shapes under both loading conditions. The results of this study provide a deeper understanding of ductile fracture with applications in manufacturing industry, aerospace industry and in the design of nano/micro-electromechanical devices i.e. NEMS/MEMS.

Abstract: For their resilience and toughness, filamentous entanglements are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems across length scales, from polymer-chain- to collagen-networks and from cable-net structures to forest canopies. Textiles are an everyday manifestation of filamentous entanglement: the remarkable resilience and toughness in knitted fabrics arise predominately from the topology of interlooped yarns. Yet most architected materials do not exploit entanglement as a design primitive, and industrial knitting fixes a narrow set of patterns for manufacturability. Additive manufacturing has recently enabled interlocking structures such as chainmail, knot and woven assemblies, hinting at broader possibilities for entangled architectures. The general challenge is to treat knitting itself as a three-dimensional architected material with predictable and tunable mechanics across scales. Here, we show that knitted architectures fabricated additively can be recast as periodic entangled solids whose responses are both fabric-like and programmable. We reproduce the characteristic behavior of conventional planar knits and extend knitting into the third dimension by interlooping along three orthogonal directions, yielding volumetric knits whose stiffness and dissipation are tuned by prescribed pre-strain. We propose a simple scaling that unifies the responses across stitch geometries and constituent materials. Further, we realize the same topology from centimeter to micrometer scales, culminating in the fabrication of what is, to our knowledge, the smallest knitted structure ever made. By demonstrating 3D-printed knits can be interpreted both as a traditional fabric, as well as a novel architected material with defined periodicity, this work establishes the dual nature of entangled filaments and paves the way towards a new form of material architectures with high degrees of entanglement.

Abstract: Magnetoencephalography, the noninvasive measurement of magnetic fields produced by brain activity, utilizes quantum sensors like superconducting quantum interference devices or atomic magnetometers. Here we derive a fundamental, technology-independent bound on the information that such measurements can convey. Using the energy resolution limit of magnetic sensing together with the brain's metabolic power, we obtain a universal expression for the maximum information rate, which depends only on geometry, metabolism, and Planck's constant, and the numerical value of which is 2.6 Mbit/s. At the high bandwidth limit we arrive at a bound scaling linearly with the area of the current source boundary. We thus demonstrate a biophysical holographic bound for metabolically powered information conveyed by the magnetic field. For the geometry and metabolic power of the human brain the geometric bound is 6.6 Gbit/s.

Abstract: The structural integrity of microtubules is paramount for cellular function. We present a theoretical analysis of their lattice fracture, focusing on the influence of multi-seam structures arising from monomer defects and aiming to provide a more accurate estimation of GDP lattice parameters. Our findings reveal that seams function as pre-existing pathways that accelerate damage propagation. Consequently, monomer vacancies destabilize the lattice due to the inherent structural loss of tubulin-tubulin contacts and the additive acceleration of fracture through multiple seams. Importantly, the comparison of our simulations with experiments on lattice fracture suggests that the intrinsic ratio of longitudinal to lateral binding energies is bounded at approximately 1.5, challenging previous predictions of lattice anisotropy from tip-growth models and highlighting the urgent need to incorporate into current growth models parameters obtained from lattice dynamics.

Abstract: In biological cells, DNA replication is carried out by the replisome, a protein complex encompassing multiple DNA polymerases. DNA replication is semi-discontinuous: a DNA polymerase synthesizes one (leading) strand of the DNA continuously, and another polymerase synthesizes the other (lagging) strand discontinuously. Complex dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase within the replisome result in the formation of short interim fragments, known as Okazaki fragments, and gaps between them. Although the semi-discontinuous replication is ubiquitous, a detailed characterization of it remains elusive. In this work, we develop a framework to investigate the semi-discontinuous replication by incorporating stochastic dynamics of the lagging-strand polymerase. Computing the size distribution of Okazaki fragments and gaps, we uncover the significance of the polymerase dissociation in shaping them. We apply the method to the previous experiment on the T4 bacteriophage replication system and identify the key parameters governing the polymerase dynamics. These results reveal that the collisions of lagging-strand polymerase with pre-synthesised Okazaki fragments primarily trigger its dissociation from the lagging strand.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by the need to balance indirect protection of populations with direct benefits of vaccinating high-risk individuals, and to address the limitations of current strategies that focus on short-term objectives.

Method: An age-stratified non-Markovian model is developed, which aggregates states to represent memory dynamics. A mapping to a Markovian representation is created to enable real-time predictions. A dynamic prioritization strategy is designed to minimize long-term epidemic burden.

Result: The strategy outperforms static policies and short-term heuristics, providing actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.

Conclusion: This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.

Abstract: Effective vaccine prioritization is critical for epidemic control, yet real outbreaks exhibit memory effects that inflate state space and make long-term prediction and optimization challenging. As a result, many strategies are tuned to short-term objectives and overlook how vaccinating certain individuals indirectly protects others. We develop a general age-stratified non-Markovian epidemic model that captures memory dynamics and accommodates diverse epidemic models within one framework via state aggregation. Building on this, we map non-Markovian final states to an equivalent Markovian representation, enabling real-time fast direct prediction of long-term epidemic outcomes under vaccination. Leveraging this mapping, we design a dynamic prioritization strategy that continually allocates doses to minimize the predicted long-term final epidemic burden, explicitly balancing indirect transmission blocking with the direct protection of important groups and outperforming static policies and those short-term heuristics that target only immediate direct effects. We further uncover the underlying mechanism that drives shifts in vaccine prioritization as the epidemic progresses and coverage accumulates, underscoring the importance of adaptive allocations. This study renders long-term prediction tractable in systems with memory and provides actionable guidance for optimal vaccine deployment.

TL;DR: Beam halo formation in high-repetition-rate FELs significantly impacts beam quality and machine protection, and this study identifies a three-step mechanism explaining its origin and effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding beam halo formation is crucial for optimizing free-electron lasers, especially for maintaining high-repetition-rate operation.

Method: The study uses theoretical analysis, particle-in-cell simulations, and experimental measurements including solenoid tuning to confirm the mechanism.

Result: A three-step mechanism caused by coupled longitudinal-transverse dynamics leads to beam halo formation through energy-radius correlation, velocity bunching, and differential overfocusing.

Conclusion: The identified mechanism provides insights for mitigating beam halo effects and optimizing FEL performance for high repetition rates.

Abstract: Beam halo formation poses a critical challenge for high-repetition-rate continuous-wave (CW) free-electron lasers (FELs), directly affecting beam quality and machine protection, as observed during the LCLS-II commissioning. We identify and experimentally validate a previously unrecognized three-step mechanism for halo generation in the photoinjector, arising from coupled longitudinal-transverse dynamics in the low-energy beam. Theoretical analysis reveals that (i) the RF buncher induces an energy-radius correlation, (ii) velocity bunching transforms this correlation into hollowed density structures in the bunch head and tail, and (iii) differential overfocusing of these hollowed regions by downstream focusing forms the observed halo. This mechanism is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations and direct experimental measurements, including controlled formation of a core-ring profile via solenoid tuning. The results establish the physical origin of the halo and demonstrate a mitigation via buncher compression tuning that reduces halo and downstream loss, supporting sustained high-repetition-rate FEL operation.

TL;DR: Plasma processing can help maintain the performance of superconducting radio-frequency cavities, avoiding the need to remove cryomodules for refurbishment. Experiments on QWRs and HWRs at FRIB suggest that using higher-order modes for plasma can improve density and reduce mismatch. Plasma processing was successfully tested in a cryomodule, reducing field emission X-rays after treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper discusses the application of plasma processing as an alternative to cryomodule refurbishment for maintaining the performance of superconducting radio-frequency cavities. This could save costs and reduce downtime in accelerators.

Method: The research involves plasma processing of several QWRs and HWRs at the FRIB using both the fundamental power coupler (FPC) and higher-order modes. A trial was conducted in a cryomodule in January 2024.

Result: Plasma processing showed promising results, including lower field emission X-rays in a cryomodule test. Higher-order modes provided better plasma density and reduced mismatch compared to the FPC.

Conclusion: Plasma processing is an effective alternative to cryomodule refurbishment for maintaining SRF cavity performance. The success of initial tests and planned future studies suggest this approach is feasible and potentially beneficial for accelerator facilities.

Abstract: Plasma processing has been shown to help mitigate degradation of the performance of superconducting radio-frequency cavities, providing an alternative to removal of cryomodules from the accelerator for refurbishment. Studies of plasma processing for quarter-wave resonators (QWRs) and half-wave resonators (HWRs) are underway at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), where a total of 324 such resonators are presently in operation. Plasma processing tests were done on several QWRs using the fundamental power coupler (FPC) to drive the plasma, with promising results. Driving the plasma with a higher-order mode allows for less mismatch at the FPC and higher plasma density. The first plasma processing trial for FRIB QWRs in a cryomodule was conducted in January 2024. Cold tests of the cryomodule showed a significant reduction in field emission X-rays after plasma processing.

Abstract: We demonstrate a multi-beam scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging that integrates down-sampling with super-resolution image reconstruction via a compressive sensing framework. A custom condenser aperture with six randomly positioned circular holes is employed to produce a multi-beam STEM probe, with beam distribution tuned through defocus. While the raw multi-beam images exhibit overlapping patterns, reconstruction using Adam optimization and total variation normalization yields high-fidelity images that closely reproduce the original sample structures, even from substantially down-sampled data. The proposed approach offers a pathway toward significant acceleration of such techniques through multibeam sparse sampling and computational reconstruction potentially useful for the analytical scanning methods in general.

TL;DR: Oxygen in drift chamber gas mixtures is harmful due to high electron attachment, while others like Isobutane, Isopropanol, He are okay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aimed to determine safe gas mixtures for drift chambers in particle detectors.

Method: Used experimental data from MEG II and Garfield++ simulations.

Result: Excluding Oxygen increases drift chamber performance, confirmed experimentally and through simulation.

Conclusion: Oxygen shouldn't be used in drift chamber gases; alternatives perform well.

Abstract: The use of Oxygen in gas mixtures for drift chambers is highly discouraged because Oxygen, being strongly electronegative, is generally believed to lead, even in very small quantities, to extremely reduced drift electron attachment values, thus preventing the detector's operation.The drift chamber of the MEG II experiment at PSI has been operating for several years with a gas mixture that mainly contains He:Isobutane in relative proportions of 90:10% by molar concentration, in addition to 1.5% Isopropanol and 0.5% Oxygen. Oxygen and Isopropanol are essential for the proper functioning of the chamber. The electron attachment in the mixture used has proven negligible for the proper operation of the chamber and agrees well with the Garfield++ simulation after correctly accounting for the three-body attachment simulation.

TL;DR: A novel micropattern gaseous detector using a 3D-printed Thick-GEM with three annular sectors achieves gas gain in the Ar/CO₂ environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution gaseous detector applications require high gas gain without additional amplification.

Method: The detector uses a 3D-printed Thick-GEM with three annular sectors of varying sizes around holes. Gas gain was measured in Ar/CO₂ gas and tested over 24 hours.

Result: The 0.15 mm annulus sector showed gas gain above 10⁴ with stable operation. Other sectors had lower gains and discharge rates.

Conclusion: Annular rim size significantly affects gas gain and stability. The 0.15 mm sector is optimal for stable high gain operation.

Abstract: We present the first micropattern gaseous detector that employs a small 3D-printed Thick-GEM as its sole gain element. The detector can achieve sufficient gas gain for regular operation without the need for pre-amplification by additional gain elements. We describe the design, quality control, assembly, and test of this detector. The 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm active area of the Thick-GEM features three separate sectors with different sizes of the clearance rim annuli (0.1 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.2 mm) around the 0.7 mm diameter holes. The gas gain is found to depend strongly on the rim size. When operated in Ar/CO$_2$ 70:30 gas, the sector with 0.15 mm annulus rims reaches a gain above 10$^4$ while operating in a stable manner with an acceptably low discharge rate. The gain reach under stable operation is found to be considerably lower in the other two sectors. The gas gain shows a characteristic time-dependence as it rises quickly in the first hour of operation and then drops slowly over the next 24 hours and subsequently stabilizes.

Abstract: Randomness is fundamental for secure communication and information processing. While continuous-variable optical systems offer an attractive platform for this task, certifying genuine quantum randomness in such setups remains challenging. We present a semi-device-independent scheme for randomness certification tailored to continuous-variable implementations, where the dimension assumption is operationally implemented by restricting state preparations to the two-level Fock subspace. Using standard homodyne and displacement-based measurements, we show that simple optical setups can achieve dimension-witness violations that certify positive min-entropy, even in the presence of realistic losses and misaligned reference frames. These results demonstrate that practical and scalable quantum randomness generation is achievable with minimal experimental complexity on continuous-variable platforms.

Abstract: A variety of quantum computing algorithms exist for the preparation of approximate Hamiltonian ground states. A natural and important question is how these ground-state approximations can be further improved using adiabatic state preparation. Here, we present a heuristic method to carry out adiabatic state preparation starting from a generic initial wavefunction. Given a quantum circuit that prepares the initial wavefunction, and a target Hamiltonian for which one wishes to prepare the ground state, we present an algorithm to construct an adiabatic path between these two states. This method works by approximating a parent Hamiltonian for the initial wavefunction, and the quality of this approximation can be can be checked prior to running the ASP algorithm. We apply this technique to simulate the ground state of water and the lowest-lying multireference singlet state of methylene, using various initial wavefunctions as the starting point of the adiabatic path.

Abstract: A quantum error correction code is assessed over its ability to correct errors in noisy quantum circuits. This task requires extensive simulations of faulty quantum circuits, which are often made tractable by considering stochastic Pauli noise models, as they are compatible with efficient classical simulation techniques. However, such noise models do not fully capture the variety of physical error mechanisms encountered in realistic quantum platforms. In this work, we extend circuit-level noise modeling beyond the Pauli framework by estimating the threshold of the color code under more general noise models. Specifically, we consider two representative non-Pauli error channels: a systematic $X$-rotation model that introduces coherent over-rotations, and an amplitude damping channel that captures relaxation processes. These models are incorporated at the circuit level into color code circuits using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz. Our simulations demonstrate that tensor network simulations enable accurate threshold estimation under non-Pauli noise for color codes up to distance $d=7$ (73 qubits). Comparing our results with the Pauli twirling approximations of the noise models, we find that coherent over-rotations yield systematically higher error rates, deviating from the Pauli twirling approximation as the code distance increases.

Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an excellent solid state qubit with optically-addressable transitions and a long electron spin coherence time at elevated temperatures. However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be ηBR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for photodiodes with improved quantum efficiency for gravitational wave detectors using 2-μm laser light. It highlights that traditional extended-InGaAs photodiodes face challenges in maintaining true quantum efficiency due to increasing dark noise as temperature rises. The study shows that optimizing photodiodes' design is essential for better performance in future detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for more efficient photodiodes to improve gravitational wave detection accuracy, especially with longer wavelengths and colder environments.

Method: Characterization of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode's performance across temperature ranges, measuring dark noise and detection efficiency.

Result: Lower temperature reduces dark noise but decreases detection efficiency, suggesting a need for new photodiode designs tailored for 2-μm applications.

Conclusion: Investment in dedicated photodiode designs is crucial for advancing gravitational wave detector sensitivities through 2-μm laser usage.

Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 μm. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-μm laser light.

Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.

Abstract: The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.

Abstract: Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.

Abstract: Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.

Abstract: We investigate the relationships among the wave property, particle property and mixedness of quantum states based on the lp-norm coherence. By conforming that the lp-norm coherence is an appropriate measure of wave property and introducing a measure of particle property based on the differences between the maximal l2-norm coherence and the general l2-norm coherence, we present tradeoff relationships among the wave, particle and mixedness of quantum states. For 1<= p <2, we establish two kinds of tradeoffs of the wave, particle and mixedness with respect to the upper and lower bounds of the lp-norm coherence given by the l2-norm coherence. These trade relations give rise to compressive understanding of the intrinsic connections among the wave, particle and mixedness of quantum states, and cover some existing results as particular ones.

### [137] [Recovery of optical losses with the Petz recovery map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05941)
*Jinyan Chen,Minjeong Song,Valerio Scarani*

TL;DR: The Petz recovery map outperforms single recovery protocol when performance is considered.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum information processing relies heavily on optical systems, but information loss due to scattering poses a significant challenge. This paper explores how to mitigate such losses using Petz recovery maps.

Method: The authors construct the Petz recovery map for single mode losses and compare its performance with an alternative recovery protocol, analyzing the impact of reference state proximity on recovery effectiveness.

Result: The Petz recovery map shows better performance than the alternative protocol, and its effectiveness is enhanced when the reference state is closer to the true state.

Conclusion: The Petz recovery map is a near-optimal protocol for correcting Gaussian lossy channels in optical quantum systems, offering a robust solution for maintaining quantum information integrity.

Abstract: Optical systems are a main platform for quantum information processing, while a hidden challenge in these systems is information loss due to scattering into unmonitored modes, typically modeled as state-independent beam-splitter interactions. While such losses simply erase information encoded across modes, they directly degrade information encoded in the quantum state of a mode. Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols.

Abstract: The quantum speed limit sets a fundamental restriction on the evolution time of quantum systems. We explore the relationship between quantum imaginarity and the quantum speed limit by utilizing measures such as relative entropy, trace distance, and geometric imaginarity. These speed limits define the fundamental constraints on the minimum time necessary for quantum systems to evolve under various dynamical processes. As applications the dephasing dynamics and dissipative dynamics are analyzed in detail. The quantum speed limit in stochastic-approximate transformations is also investigated. Our quantum speed limits provide lower bounds on how fast a physical system evolves to attain or lose certain imaginarity, with potential applications in efficient quantum computation designs, quantum control and quantum sensing.

Abstract: The definition of quantum states in terms of tagged vector spaces is generalized to incorporate the spatiotemporal and spin degrees of freedom. Considering a tagged vector space where the index space is a function space, representing the additional degrees of freedom, we obtained axioms for the tags that include a completeness condition expressed in terms of a functional integral with an abstract functional integration measure. Using these axioms, we derive a generating functional for the moments of this functional integration measure. These moments are then used to evaluate the functional integrals of Gaussian functionals, leading to expressions in accordance with those obtained as generalizations of equivalent integrals over a finite number of integration variables. For a Gaussian functional used as a probability distributions, we show that its moments, obtained with this functional integration measure, satisfy Carleman's condition, indicating that the measure is unique.

Abstract: We introduce the Spin-ZX calculus as an elevation of Penrose's diagrams and associated binor calculus to the level of a formal diagrammatic language. The power of doing so is illustrated by the variety of scientific areas we apply it to: permutational quantum computing, quantum machine learning, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. Respectively, we analyse permutational computing transition amplitudes, evaluate barren plateaus for SU(2) symmetric ansätze, study properties of AKLT states, and derive the minimum quantised volume in loop quantum gravity.
  Our starting point is the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, a purely diagrammatic language that has been proven to be complete for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. That is, any equation that can be derived in the Hilbert space formalism, can also be derived in the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus. We embed the Spin-ZX calculus inside the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, rendering it a quantum information flavoured diagrammatic language for the quantum theory of angular momentum, i.e. SU(2) representation theory. We diagrammatically derive the fundamental spin coupling objects - such as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, symmetrising mappings between qubits and spin spaces, and spin Hamiltonians - under this embedding.
  Our results establish the Spin-ZX calculus as a powerful tool for representing and computing with SU(2) systems graphically, offering new insights into foundational relationships and paving the way for new diagrammatic algorithms for theoretical physics.

Result: 提供了一个关于超测度模型的物理例子，挑战了贝尔不等式的界限，提出了与量子力学细微不同的预测

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了贝尔定理，并为未来实验测试提供了方向

Abstract: The precision with which we can measure operators that do not commute with conserved quantities is limited by the need to preserve the associated global symmetries. We show how to construct a local hidden-variable model that violates Bell inequalities by interpreting this measurement error as altering the measure space of the hidden variables. This provides a physically-motivated example of a supermeasured model, where the statistical independence assumption used to form Bell inequalities is violated without there being a causal dependence of the measurement settings on the hidden variables (superdeterminism) or a causal dependence of the hidden variables on the measurement settings (retrocausality). The model also gives subtly different predictions to quantum mechanics, that could be tested experimentally.

Abstract: In various physical implementations of quantum information processing, qubits are realized in a Lambda type system configuration as two stable lower energy levels coupled indirectly via an unstable higher energy level, that is, in comparison, a lot more susceptible to decoherence. We consider the quantum control problem of optimal state transfer between two isospectral density matrices, over an arbitrary finite time horizon, for the quantum Lambda system. The cost considered is a compromise between the energy of the control field and the average occupancy in the highest energy level. We apply a geometric approach that combines the use of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, a symmetry reduction technique to reduce the number of parameters in the resulting optimization problem, and several auxiliary techniques to bound the parameter space in the search for the optimal solution. We prove several properties of the optimal control and trajectories for this problem, including their normality and smoothness. We obtain a system of differential equations that must be satisfied by the optimal pair of control and trajectory we treat in detail, with numerical simulations, and solve a case study involving a Hadamard-like transformation. Our techniques can be adapted to other contexts and promise to push to a more consequential level, the application of geometric control in quantum systems.

Abstract: We introduce a family of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes built as a rotation-symmetric superposition of squeezed vacuum states, which promise protection against both loss and dephasing noise channels. The robustness of these "squeezed-vacuum codes" arises from being arranged at evenly spaced angles in phase-space, and simultaneously in evenly spaced photon-number support $n \equiv {2k} \! \pmod {2m}$. We present simple preparation circuits: a two-legged code using a Hadamard-conditional-squeezing-Hadamard sequence on an ancilla qubit, and for general "$m$-legged" codewords using sequences of conditional rotations. The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity. We outline implementations in circuit QED and trapped-ion platforms, where high-fidelity Gaussian operations and conditional controls are available or under active development. These results help establish squeezed-vacuum codes as practical, hardware-ready, members of the bosonic codes class.

Abstract: Quantum computing relies on quantum error correction for high-fidelity logical operations, but scaling to achieve near-term quantum utility is highly resource-intensive. High-rate quantum LDPC codes can reduce error correction overhead, yet realizing high-rate fault-tolerant computation with these codes remains a central challenge. Apart of the lattice surgery approach, standard schemes for realizing logical gates have so far been restricted to performing global operations on all logical qubits at the same time. Another approach relies on low-rate code switching methods. In this work, we introduce a gate-based protocol for addressable single- and multi-qubit Clifford operations on individual logical qubits encoded within one or more quantum LDPC codes. Our scheme leverages logical transversal operations via an auxiliary Bacon-Shor code to perform logical operations with constant time overhead enabled by teleportation. We demonstrate the implementation of an overcomplete logical Clifford gate set and perform numerical simulations to evaluate the error-correction performance of our protocol. Finally, we observe that our scheme can be integrated with magic state cultivation protocols to achieve universal, gate-based, and fully addressable quantum computation.

TL;DR: The paper presents an algorithm for simulating Clifford circuits using Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix.

Motivation: Efficient simulation of Clifford circuits is significant for practical quantum computing applications and understanding quantum computational advantages.

Method: Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit, using LDL decomposition over GF(2) matrices, building on ZX-calculus techniques.

Result: The algorithm achieves equivalent or better simulation efficiency compared to existing methods, especially when computing multiple amplitudes or samples.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational method for simulating Clifford circuits more efficiently, contributing to the broader field of quantum computing simulations.

Abstract: Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.

TL;DR: This paper explores Bohmian mechanics' finite-sample statistics, revealing how trajectory-based uncertainty varies under different quantum conditions and setups, aiding in numerical simulations of particles and spin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Bohmian mechanics' practical implications for numerical simulations of particles, especially regarding finite-sample statistics and trajectory uncertainty, is crucial for accurate modeling and interpretation.

Method: The study employs theoretical analysis of Bohmian trajectories in both regular and chaotic flow scenarios, derives statistical moments under quantum equilibrium, and examines spin-1/2 particles and ensemble behaviors.

Result: In regular quantum systems, finite samples closely match expected statistical moments. However, chaotic or degenerate systems show deviations in sample means and variances. For spin-1/2 particles, different velocity fields from convective and Pauli currents yield varied trajectory statistics, impacting ensemble interpretations.

Conclusion: Bohmian mechanics can offer practical insights into quantum uncertainty through trajectory analysis, aligning with standard quantum theory in equilibrium but highlighting the need for careful numerical methods in non-equilibrium scenarios.

Abstract: We analyze finite-sample statistics of Bohmian trajectories for single spinless and spin-1/2 particles. Equivariance ensures agreement with $|ψ|^2$ in the quantum equilibrium limit, yet experiments and simulations necessarily use finite ensembles. We show that in regular flows (e.g., wavepackets or low-mode superpositions of eigenstates of harmonic oscillators) sample means and/or variances over modest $N$ are consistent with Born-rule moments. In contrast, degenerate superpositions of 3D oscillators with nodal barriers and chaotic Bohmian dynamics exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions and complex flow partitioning, which can yield noticeable finite-sample deviations in the mean and variance. For the spin-1/2 particle, both convective and Pauli currents conserve $|ψ|^2$, but they are associated with different velocity fields and thus might yield different finite-sample trajectory statistics. These findings calibrate the interpretation of trajectory-based uncertainty and provide practical guidance for numerical Bohmian simulations of spin and transport, without challenging the equivalence to orthodox quantum mechanics in the quantum equilibrium ensemble.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a powerful technique for accelerating adiabatic quantum computing. However, it becomes self-limiting in complex optimizations like the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model: long evolution times $T$ needed to traverse crossings force the CD strength to scale as $1/T$, causing it to vanish before convergence and wasting the quantum resources invested in its implementation. We break this trade-off with a Hybrid adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (HAVQDS). HAVQDS combines adaptive real-time evolution for circuit compression with imaginary-time steps that suppress excitations at no extra gate cost. For the SK model (6--14 qubits), HAVQDS achieves higher approximation ratios than adiabatic or CD approaches, while reducing CNOT counts by 1--2 orders of magnitude, enabling high-fidelity quantum optimization.

Abstract: We investigate quantum coherence in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a squeezed-magnon drive. By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.

Abstract: The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.

Result: 该研究在单维和二维 transverse-field Ising 模型 (TFIM) 以及带有纵向场的 TFIM 中进行了基准测试。对于纯 TFIM，$oxed{	ext{⌈N/2⌉}}$ 层足够：NLCE + VQE 与精确对角化相匹配。对于带有纵向场的 TFIM，其中奇偶对称性被破坏，PCAT 成为必需，$oxed{	ext{⌈N/2⌉}}$和 $N$ 层在增加集群大小时均收敛，且 $N$ 层提供更高的精度。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将 PCAT 作为基于增补的集群框架扩展到变分量子算法，实现了量子计算中准粒子激发态的高效精确计算。具体而言，通过结合 NLCE 和 VQE，并通过 PCAT 的精度修饰，不仅实现了对准粒子激发态的理论计算，还为量子计算中处理复杂量子系统提供了新的方法论支撑。

Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.

Abstract: High-fidelity two-logical-qubit gates are essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with bosonic codes, yet experimentally reported fidelities have rarely exceeded 90\%. Here, we propose a geometric phase engineering approach for implementing controlled-phase gates for binomially encoded logical qubits. This method leverages the structural simplicity of geometric drives to reduce the numerical optimization dimensionality while fully incorporating system nonlinearities, enabling fast and high-fidelity logical operations. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a process fidelity of 97.4$\pm$0.8\% for a controlled-Z gate between two binomial codes, surpassing all previously reported two-logical-qubit gates in bosonic codes. This work demonstrates that geometric phase engineering provides an effective and experimentally feasible route to fast, high-fidelity logical operations in bosonic quantum processors.

Conclusion: This integrated system advances compact, scalable quantum photonic platforms, paving the way for scalable quantum computing architectures and quantum networking technologies.

Abstract: Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.

Conclusion: 该研究为研究这类spin链模型的长距行为提供了一个新的工具，可扩展到其他类似系统。

Abstract: Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Introduce a tunable framework for generalized quantum state discrimination (GSD) and apply it to quantum key distribution (QKD) through a protocol called phiQKD. Replace traditional unambiguous state discrimination (IDP) measurement with a one-parameter family of hybrid POVMs characterized by a tilting angle φ. This allows for continuous control over the trade-off among correct, incorrect, and inconclusive outcomes. While the asymptotic key rate improvement over B92 is modest, phiQKD offers a practical advantage by enabling adaptability to noise and channel imperfections via measurement tunability. By evaluating the protocol under asymptotic, finite-key, and composable security models, we show that, treating quantum measurement as a tunable design parameter, rather than a fixed operation, enables flexible protocol optimization and improved performance under realistic constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The embedding of QFD in applications such as IoT and V2X communication requires the optimization of design parameters under physically complex environments. This paper focuses on optimizing angle parameters in QFD to achieve performance enhancements, specifically in quantum key distribution, where resource constraints must be considered.

Method: Through physical reasoning, mathematical derivations, and numerical simulations, we design and optimize the angle parameters, particularly the tilting angle φ, within the phiQKD framework. This systematic approach allows for the practical application of tunable quantum measurements in realistic settings.

Result: The phiQKD protocol shows potential to better meet the design requirements in QKD applications. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the tuned measurement parameters in optimizing key distribution performance.

Conclusion: This paper proposes a new approach to optimizing angle parameters in QFD, specifically in quantum key distribution applications, which offers promising solutions for improving the practical performance of QFD in resource-constrained environments with complex channel conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a tunable framework for generalized quantum state discrimination (GSD) and apply it to quantum key distribution (QKD) through a protocol we call phiQKD. Building upon the two-state B92 protocol, phiQKD replaces the traditional unambiguous state discrimination (IDP) measurement with a one-parameter family of hybrid POVMs characterized by a tilting angle $φ$. This allows for continuous control over the trade-off among correct, incorrect, and inconclusive outcomes. While the asymptotic key rate improvement over B92 is modest, phiQKD offers a practical advantage by enabling adaptability to noise and channel imperfections via measurement tunability. By evaluating the protocol under asymptotic, finite-key, and composable security models, we show that, treating quantum measurement as a tunable design parameter, rather than a fixed operation, enables flexible protocol optimization and improved performance under realistic constraints.

### [160] [Quantum Monads in Phase Space and Related Toeplitz Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06491)
*Maurice de Gosson*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces quantum blobs as minimal uncertainty symplectic ellipsoids in phase space, analogous to coherent states but defined using non-degenerate Gaussian wave functions. These blobs, or geometric monads in Leibniz's sense, provide a foundational structure for phase-space quantum mechanics. The authors establish a one-to-one correspondence between such monads and Toeplitz operators, extending the standard anti-Wick quantization. This framework allows for a generalized definition of density matrices within phase-space quantum theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper likely aims to provide a new mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics using geometric structures in phase space, building on prior work on quantum blobs. The introduction of Toeplitz operators and generalized density matrices suggests the goal is to extend the standard quantization techniques while maintaining consistency with the uncertainty principle.

Method: The authors use a combination of symplectic geometry, functional analysis, and operator theory. They work with Gaussian wave functions and phase-space distributions, employing mathematical tools like Toeplitz operators and anti-Wick quantization to establish the correspondence between quantum blobs and coherent states.

Result: The main result is a comprehensive framework linking quantum blobs, Toeplitz operators, and generalized coherent states with density matrices. This framework provides a new way to describe quantum states and observables in phase space, which could lead to new insights in quantum mechanics and related areas like quantum optics and quantum information theory.

Conclusion: The paper successfully bridges quantum blobs and generalized coherent states with Toeplitz operators and phase-space density matrices, offering a novel geometric approach to quantum mechanics that respects the uncertainty principle. This work opens new avenues for further research into the geometric and algebraic structures underpinning quantum theory.

Abstract: In earlier work, we introduced quantum blobs as minimum-uncertainty symplectic ellipsoids in phase space. These objects may be viewed as geometric monads in the Leibnizian sense, representing the elementary units of phase-space structure consistent with the uncertainty principle. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between such monads and generalized coherent states, represented by arbitrary non-degenerate Gaussian wave functions in configuration space. To each of these states, we associate a classs of Toeplitz operators that extends the standard anti-Wick quantization scheme. The mathematical and physical properties of these operators are analyzed, allowing for a generalized definition of density matrices within the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This research addresses the need for efficient quantum error correction in multi-level systems, enhancing quantum computing's practicality.

Method: Proposed a general framework using spin systems with d-dimensional qudits, employing distance-3 or 5 codes in 12d or 40d Hilbert spaces, generalizable to higher distances and multiple qudits.

Result: The encoding offers exponential resource advantages over multi-level logical qubit mappings, facilitating practical quantum computing.

Conclusion: This strategy provides a scalable and robust foundation for implementing logical qudits in finite multi-level physical systems, advancing quantum computing's potential.

Abstract: The universal quantum computer will enable the simulation of arbitrary quantum states governed by arbitrary Hamiltonians. In this context, it is essential to equip future quantum processors with fault-tolerant logical qudits, since qudits naturally align with the simulation of multi-level physical systems. In this study, we present a general framework and working examples of fault-tolerant logical qudit encoding using spin systems, which are among the most coherent and robust finite multi-level physical platforms. The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits. A quantitative comparison shows that the logical qudit encoding proposed here offers an exponential resource advantage over multi-level mappings from logical qubits, and therefore we believe this strategy can pave the way for realizing logical qudit encodings in finite multi-level physical systems.

Conclusion: 该研究 opens up new perspective 为设备独立应用中 Bell 测试提供了理论依据，特别是对于无源数生成和纠缠检测等关键应用。

Abstract: In this paper, we highlight how any Bell inequality for a configuration involving $n$ parties each performing one of $m$ binary-outcome measurements has a canonical form that is no-signalling-projection invariant. Specifically, the $L^2$-projection of weakly signalling data onto the no-signalling polytope leaves the violation of this canonical Bell inequality unchanged. Our methods allow us to derive a general closed formula for the projection and present a substantially more computationally simple procedure for its evaluation. We also show this can be generalised to non-standard projections of potential interest for certain applications. No-signalling projections serve as a preliminary step before undertaking any device-independent application involving Bell experiment data, such as hypothesis testing against local realism, random number generation and entanglement detection.

*Gözde Üstün,Simon J. Devitt*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper compares two methods for creating qudit graph states using silicon spin qudits. One method uses fusion on a single qudit emitter, while the other uses direct coupling between two qudit emitters without fusion. The second method is found to be more reliable for scalable architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to develop robust and scalable methods for generating quantum graph states, which are fundamental resources for quantum computing and communication.

Method: The paper evaluates two schemes: one using a single emitter with fusion (destructive, non-deterministic), and the other using two emitters directly coupled via a CZ gate (deterministic, reliable). The methods involve creating linear graphs and then combining them into more complex structures.

Result: The study finds that the two-emitter scheme is more effective for building complex resource states, with better scalability compared to the fusion-based single-emitter approach.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to the field of quantum information processing by identifying advantages and limitations of different qudit generation methods, aiding in the design of more efficient quantum architectures.

Abstract: In this work, we compare two schemes for generating arbitrary qudit graph states using spin qudits in silicon. The first scheme proposes the creation of qudit linear graph states from a single emitter - a silicon spin qudit. By employing fusion - a destructive and non-deterministic measurement technique - these linear graphs can then be combined to form more complex resource states (multi-photon entangled states), such as ring or ladder structures, which are used to carry out the computation. The second scheme employs two spin qudits. Instead of relying on fusion, the two emitters are directly coupled via CZ to generate the same resource states, thereby eliminating the need for fusion. We compare the two schemes in terms of their ability to produce equivalent resource states and discuss their respective advantages and limitations for building scalable architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of quantum systems necessitates advanced simulation techniques, pushing the boundaries of what classical computers can handle.

Method: GCAMPS combines tensor network and stabilizer simulation methods to efficiently simulate multi-level (qudit) quantum systems.

Result: Extended CAMPS (GCAMPS) successfully simulates qudits (e.g., qutrits) with performance akin to qubit systems, overcoming limitations of tensor networks in higher-degree systems.

Conclusion: This breakthrough enables the classical simulation of complex quantum phenomena, opening new avenues in physics and quantum info processing, particularly for systems where traditional methods fall short.

Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum systems are notoriously difficult computational problems, with conventional state vector and tensor network methods restricted to quantum systems that feature only a small number of qudits. The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing.

Conclusion: 量子参数估计中的测量不兼容性不允许同时完全精确测量所有参数。

Abstract: Measurement incompatibility is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. In the context of estimating multiple parameters of a quantum system, this manifests as a fundamental trade-off between the precisions with which different parameters can be estimated. Often, a parameter can be optimally measured, but at the cost of gaining no information about incompatible parameters. Here, we report that there are systems where one parameter's information can be maximised while not completely losing information about the other parameters. In doing so, we find attainable trade-off relations for quantum parameter estimation with a structure that is different to typical Heisenberg-type trade-offs. We demonstrate our findings by implementing an optimal entangling measurement on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer.

TL;DR: ReQISC reduces 2Q gate durations by ~5x compared to CNOT, improves circuit depth, and increases program fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring next-generation quantum computing architectures is crucial as quantum computing scales up, pushing existing methods to their limits.

Method: ReQISC introduces a reconfigurable quantum instruction set with a unified microarchitecture. The method includes a program-aware synthesis pass, an aggressive optimization pass, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass for hardware mapping.

Result: By leveraging SU(4) gates, ReQISC achieves significant performance improvements. It reduces the average pulse duration for arbitrary 2Q gates by a factor of 4.97 compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: ReQISC overcomes key limitations in quantum hardware scalability and optimization, marking a practical step toward efficient quantum computing architectures.

Abstract: The performance of current quantum hardware is severely limited. While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.
  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.
  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.

Abstract: The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.

TL;DR: 在量子算法中的资源驱动量子优势方面，尽管纠缠和相干性是许多量子算法的关键，但 Grover 搜索算法的量子优势并非完全依赖它们。通过提出广义 Grover 搜索算法，我们发现成功概率不仅取决于调用 oracle 的次数，还与相干分数有关，这衡量了初始量子状态与其等叠加态的 fidelity。我们还探讨了相干分数在量子最小化算法中的作用，该算法为量子机器学习中复杂问题的解决提供了框架。这些发现有助于理解量子优势的起源，为开发新量子算法铺平了道路。

Abstract: The question of which resources drive the advantages in quantum algorithms has long been a fundamental challenge. While entanglement and coherence are critical to many quantum algorithms, our results indicate that they do not fully explain the quantum advantage achieved by the Grover search algorithm. By introducing a generalized Grover search algorithm, we demonstrate that the success probability depends not only on the querying number of oracles but also on the coherence fraction, which quantifies the fidelity between an arbitrary initial quantum state and the equal superposition state. Additionally, we explore the role of the coherence fraction in the quantum minimization algorithm, which offers a framework for solving complex problems in quantum machine learning. These findings offer insights into the origins of quantum advantage and open pathways for the development of new quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Open systems feature a variety of phenomena that arise from non-Hermitian physics. Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement and coherence are crucial resources in quantum information theory. In some scenarios, however, it is not necessary to directly estimate entanglement or coherence measures to quantify the capabilities of a state in quantum information processing. Instead, fully entangled fraction and coherence fraction are two alternatives for entanglement and coherence in specific quantum tasks. Here, we establish a link between the coherence fraction and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which has several potential applications including cryptography and database search. We show that the success probability of the generalized Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm depends only on the coherence fraction of the initial state rather than its entanglement or coherence. Moreover, we discuss the coherence fraction dynamics and establish a relation between the operator's coherence fraction and the algorithm's success probability. Our findings highlight how quantum coherence fraction influences the efficiency of quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have demonstrated provable speedups over classical counterparts, yet establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the quantum advantage remains a core challenge. In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Abstract: We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schrödinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers hold the promise of tackling complex and otherwise intractable computational challenges through the massive parallelism offered by qubits.

Abstract: The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.

Abstract: The geometric phase stands as a foundational concept in quantum physics, revealing deep connections between geometric structures and quantum dynamical evolution. Unlike dynamical phases, geometric phases exhibit intrinsic resilience to certain types of perturbation, making them particularly valuable for quantum information processing, where maintaining coherent quantum operations is essential. This article provides a review of geometric phases in the context of universal quantum gate construction, i.e., the geometric quantum computation (GQC), with special attention to recent progress in nonadiabatic implementations that enhance gate fidelity and/or operational robustness. We first review a unified theoretical framework that can encompass all existing nonadiabatic GQC approaches, then systematically examine the design principles of nonadiabatic geometric gates with a particular focus on how optimal control techniques can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and noise resistance. In addition, we conducted detailed numerical comparisons of various nonadiabatic GQC protocols, offering a quantitative assessment of their respective performance characteristics and practical limitations. Through this focused investigation, our aim is to provide researchers with both fundamental insights and practical guidance for advancing geometric approaches in quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs), acting as energy storage devices, have potential applications in future quantum science and technology. However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage. This work broadens the scope of driven-dissipative QBs and provides practical strategies for enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.

Motivation: Exploring relativistic quantum effects on atomic momentum states

Method: Describe an experiment involving a superposition of momentum states and calculate relativistic corrections to momentum distribution

Result: The experiment shows a time-dependent momentum shift due to relativistic effects

Conclusion: Relativistic time dilation impacts momentum distribution in excited atoms

Abstract: Relativistic time dilation implies that an accelerating excited atom would have its lifetime prolonged in the lab frame. In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.

Motivation: The development of hybrid quantum-classical models addresses key challenges in quantum machine learning, such as optimization barriers and the curse of dimensionality, with theoretical guarantees for convergence.

Method: The research introduces QPINN-MAC, which integrates QNNs and PINNs through both multiplicative and additive couplings. This architecture is proven to retain the universal approximation property of PINNs and overcome the barren plateau problem inherent in QNNs.

Result: The QPINN-MAC model shows superior performance in solving ODEs compared to traditional methods like PINNs and QNNs alone. It effectively mitigates optimization challenges, enabling successful training even in high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for practical applications of quantum-classical hybrid models, offering a solution to significant limitations in both QNNs and PINNs, thereby advancing the field of quantum machine learning.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum-Classical Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Network with Multiplicative and Additive Couplings (QPINN-MAC): a novel hybrid architecture that integrates the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with that of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Specifically, we prove that through strategic couplings between classical and quantum components, the QPINN-MAC retains the universal approximation property, ensuring its theoretical capacity to represent complex solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Simultaneously, we demonstrate that the hybrid QPINN-MAC architecture actively mitigates the barren plateau problem, regions in parameter space where cost-function gradients decay exponentially with circuit depth, a fundamental obstacle in QNNs that hinders optimization during training. Furthermore, we prove that these couplings prevent gradient collapse, ensuring trainability even in high-dimensional regimes. Thus, our results establish a new pathway for constructing quantum-classical hybrid models with theoretical convergence guarantees, which are essential for the practical application of QPINNs.

Abstract: A spin precessing in a magnetic field is often used as a quantum clock, for example in tunneling-time measurements. We show that such a clock can exist in a coherent superposition of opposite temporal orientations, treating the arrow of time as a quantum two-level system. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with equal and opposite magnetic fields provides a simple implementation, enabling interference between forward and backward evolution and Bell-type tests of temporal coherence. Extending the framework to relativistic dynamics reveals that the Dirac Hamiltonian describes an intrinsic coupling between a spin qubit and a time qubit, with matter and antimatter corresponding to opposite poles on the temporal Bloch sphere.

Abstract: We show that harnessing daemonic advantage is possible while charging a quantum battery by first time-evolving the battery collectively with an auxiliary charger, followed by an energy extraction via tracing out the charger. We define the difference between the minimum daemonic ergotropy and the maximum ergotropy of the battery as the daemonic gap at the time where the ergotropy of the battery is maximum. Considering a harmonic mode as the battery and a qubit as the auxiliary charger interacting via Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we show that the daemonic gap can be closed for specific initial passive states of the battery, including the ground state, truncated mixtures of low-lying states, and canonical thermal states. We further define the daemonic band as the difference between the maximum and the minimum daemonic ergotropy, and show that starting from the ground state of the single-mode battery, the daemonic band collapses. We also show that achieving a complete charging, along with accessing the full daemonic band, is possible for the single-mode battery using all of the other initial states by repeating the charging cycle and maximizing ergotropy in every round. We extend the battery-charger design to a multi-mode resonator battery and a qudit charger, and demonstrate, for a double-mode battery and a qutrit charger, that repeating the charging cycle is vital for simultaneously charging individual modes of the collective battery.

TL;DR: The paper investigates the transport properties of driven quantum walks in nonlinear waveguides with disorder, finding a transition from superballistic to superdiffusive transport without Anderson localization in one-dimensional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantum transport phenomena, particularly in disordered systems, is crucial for advancing quantum technologies and materials science.

Method: The authors employ numerical simulations of driven quantum walks in both clean and disordered systems, analyzing the walker distribution as a function of time and disorder strength.

Result: In clean systems, the quantum walk exhibits two transport regimes: superballistic (ballistic-like) and superdiffusive. Introducing disorder reduces the superballistic regime and leads to a suppression of Anderson localization due to the complex interplay between nonlinearity and disorder.

Conclusion: These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that disorder induces Anderson localization and deepen our understanding of nonlinear quantum walks, with implications for quantum information processing and energy transport in nonlinear media.

Abstract: It is well known that a quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies over time. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. Moreover, we study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime.

Abstract: Verification of quantum computations is crucial as experiments advance toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究发现，量子系统在环境监测中的去相干现象可以通过重复使用正算子值度量和Lindblad方程的连续时间解来详细分析。去相干使任意给定的iquasiprobability分布显式变为正，模拟了向经典性的过渡。系统维数越大，去相干时间越短。

Result: 研究证明，去相干使任意给定的iquasiprobability分布显式变为正，模拟了向经典性的过渡。系统维数越大，去相干时间越短。

Conclusion: 该研究通过对比两种方法，深入分析了量子系统在环境监测中的去相干现象，揭示其向经典性过渡的本质，为理解量子-classical 临界现象提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The decoherence phenomenon arising from an environmental monitoring of the state of a quantum system, as opposed to monitoring of a preferred observable, is worked out in detail using two equivalent formulations, namely, repeated applications of universal tomographic measurements using positive operator-valued measures, and its continuous time unravelling from the Lindblad equation. The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster.

Motivation: The authors aim to leverage generative pre-trained transformers for automatic design of quantum algorithms, specifically addressing higher-order optimization problems in the NISQ era.

Method: The study employs the QAOA-GPT framework, utilizing FEATHER graph embeddings and ADAPT-QAOA for training and evaluation on complex quantum circuits.

Result: The model achieves an average approximation ratio of over 0.95 on 8- and 16-qubit instances, outperforming classical optimization methods while maintaining consistent parameter distributions.

Conclusion: This work suggests that generative modeling can effectively design quantum circuits for complex optimization problems, paving the way for autonomous quantum algorithm development in future research.

Abstract: The recently proposed QAOA-GPT framework demonstrated that generative pre-trained transformers can learn mappings between problem graphs and optimized quantum circuits for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era.

Conclusion: The paper suggests quantum capacity regions as a promising tool for quantum network tomography, particularly for loss tomography, offering new possibilities for network analysis and design.

Abstract: With steady progress in the development of quantum networks, the question on how to best provide end-to-end characterization of such networks (Quantum Network Tomography) is quickly becoming more pressing. Initial results demonstrated how we can utilize multipartite entanglement distribution to determine error probabilities of single-Pauli channels and depolarizing channels. In this work, we show how the analysis of quantum capacity regions can be used as a powerful new tool in quantum network tomography. As a first application of the proposed method, we demonstrate how we can characterize the loss on quantum channels in the network directly from quantum capacity region diagrams, even in the presence of bit-flip errors. Our results indicate that quantum capacity regions are not only valuable for network design, resource allocation, and protocol benchmarking, but also show promise for applications in quantum network tomography, particularly in loss tomography.

Motivation: Understanding gas separation in porous materials is vital for advancing applications in energy and environment.

Method: The study used molecular simulations, including grand canonical Monte Carlo for adsorption and molecular dynamics for transport.

Result: ZIF-90's structure and surface chemistry dictate how gases like CO2 and N2 are adsorbed and transported, influencing their distribution and diffusivity.

Conclusion: These findings offer design strategies to enhance gas separation in metal-organic frameworks, benefiting applications like CO2 capture and catalysis.

Abstract: Understanding how gas mixtures diffuse and distribute within porous frameworks is central to designing advanced separation and storage materials. Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.

Abstract: Computation of electronic spectra is one of the most important applications of methods capturing static electron correlation, including complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and post-CASSCF theories. Performance of these techniques critically depends on the active space construction, both in terms of accuracy and computational effort. In this work we benchmark the performance of automatic active space construction, as implemented in the Active Space Finder software, for the computation of electronic excitation energies. The multi-step procedure constructs meaningful molecular orbitals and selects the most suitable active space based on information from more approximate correlated calculations. It aims to tackle a key difficulty in computing excitation energies with CASSCF: choosing active spaces that are balanced for several electronic states. The Active Space Finder is tested with several established data sets of small and medium-sized molecules and shows encouraging results. We evaluate multiple setting configurations and provide practical recommendations.

Motivation: The authors propose an enhanced method to describe electronic coherence and quantum-classical coupling, building upon previous work to address the accurate modeling of nonadiabatic processes.

Method: The paper introduces new mixed equations of motion within the exact factorization framework, incorporating both quantum momentum correction and phase correction up to order ħ.

Conclusion: This work provides a systematic approach to understanding and modeling electronic quantum-classical coupling with improved accuracy.

Abstract: We propose new mixed quantum-classical equations of motion within the exact factorization framework to describe electronic coherence and phase evolution simultaneously. The derivation reveals that not only a projected quantum momentum correction, recently identified by Arribas and Maitra [Phys. Rev.

Benchmark tests on one- and two-dimensional model systems demonstrate that the new formulations capture key nonadiabatic features with high accuracy.

Conclusion: This advancement provides a reliable and efficient tool for studying electron affinities, particularly for non-valence systems.

Abstract: We have developed a reduced-cost non-Dyson third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for the electron-attachment problem based on state-specific frozen natural orbitals. Density fitting and truncated natural auxiliary functions were employed to enhance computational efficiency. The use of state-specific frozen natural orbitals significantly decreases the virtual space and provides a notable speedup over the conventional EA-ADC(3) method with a systematically controllable accuracy. A perturbative correction for the truncated natural orbitals significantly reduces the error in the calculated electron affinity values. The method also shows sufficient accuracy in the case of non-valence correlation-bound anions, where the local approximation-based methods fail. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by performing an EA-ADC(3) calculation with more than 1300 basis functions.

Conclusion: 该研究为更精确地预测分子光谱提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The quantum electrodynamic Araki-Sucher correction arising from the interaction between electrons and nuclei is calculated for rovibrational energy levels of the hydrogen molecule and its isotopologues. The corresponding expectation value $\langle r_{en}^{-3}\rangle$ is evaluated across a wide range of internuclear distances using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The electronic wave function is represented as a linear combination of explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions. This correction contributes approximately tenths of a megahertz (about $10^{-5}$cm$^{-1}$) to the dissociation energy of rovibrational levels and to the transitions between them. Given recent spectroscopic measurements with an accuracy of 10 kHz, this correction is necessary to achieve sub-MHz agreement between theory and experiment.

Abstract: Robust model predictive control (MPC) aims to preserve performance under model-plant mismatch, yet robust formulations for nonlinear MPC (NMPC) with data-driven surrogates remain limited. This work proposes an offset-free robust NMPC scheme based on symbolic regression (SR). Using a compact NARX structure, we identify interpretable surrogate models that explicitly represent epistemic (structural) uncertainty at the operating-zone level, and we enforce robustness by embedding these models as hard constraints. gest margins. The single-zone variant (RNMPC$_{SZ}$) was investigated. Synthetic data were generated within one operating zone to identify SR models that are embedded as constraints, while the nominal predictor remains fixed, and the multi-zone variant (RNMPC$_{MZ}$), zone-specific SR models from multiple operating zones are jointly enforced in the constraint set; at each set-point change, the nominal predictor is re-scheduled to the SR model of the newly active zone. In both cases, robustness is induced by the intersection of the admissible sets defined by the enforced SR models, without modifying the nominal cost or introducing ancillary tube dynamics. The approach was validated on a simulated pilot-scale electric submersible pump (ESP) system with pronounced nonlinearities and dynamically varying safety envelopes (downthrust and upthrust). RNMPC$_{SZ}$ and RNMPC$_{MZ}$ maintained disturbance tracking and rejection, and by intersecting models in the constraints, they increased margins and eliminated violations (especially near the upthrust), with a slight increase in settling time. Including up to four models per zone did not increase the time per iteration, maintaining real-time viability; RNMPC$_{MZ}$ presented the lar

Abstract: Thermal management in small satellites is constrained by limited radiative area and strict mass budgets, necessitating the development of radiator structures that are simultaneously lightweight, thermally conductive, and mechanically robust. Here, we present a topology-optimization and design-space analysis framework for multifunctional lightweight radiators that achieve high specific stiffness and high effective thermal conductivity through simultaneous structural and thermal optimization. Density-based optimization produces hierarchical architectures that naturally form continuous cavities suitable for high-conductivity channels such as embedded heat pipes. The resulting microarchitectures exhibit Pareto behavior indicating efficient trade-offs between mass, stiffness, and thermal conductivity, while maintaining dynamic stability across a broad range of design parameters. Coupled structural-thermal analysis shows that voids used as thermal channels yield nearly isothermal radiating surfaces, confirming efficient lateral and transverse heat flow through the radiator. This integrated framework contributes toward the development of thermo-mechanically optimized radiator panels for small-scale spacecraft, enabling compact and efficient thermal control solutions.

Conclusion: 文章通过严格的数学分析，确定了离散微观模型均质化的柯西型和柯西-布里奥 type 继续型的条件，并表明柯西-布里奥 type 继续型在实际应用中不具有意义。

Abstract: This article answers the question of whether homogenization of discrete fine-scale mechanical models, such as particle or lattice models, gives rise to an equivalent continuum that is of Cauchy-type or Cosserat-type. The study employs the machinery of asymptotic expansion homogenization to analyze discrete mechanical models with rotational degrees of freedom commonly used to simulate the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous solids. The proposed derivation has general validity in both stationary (steady-state) and transient conditions (assuming wavelength much larger that particle size) and for arbitrary nonlinear, inelastic fine-scale constitutive equations. The results show that the unit cell problem is always stationary, and the only inertia term appears in the linear momentum balance equation at the coarse scale. Depending on the magnitude of the local bending stiffness, mathematical homogenization rigorously identifies two limiting conditions that correspond to the Cauchy continuum and the Cosserat continuum. A heuristic combination of these two limiting conditions provides very accurate results also in the transition from one limiting case to the other. Finally, the study demonstrates that cases for which the Cosserat character of the homogenized response is significant are associated with non-physically high fine-scale bending stiffness and, as such, are of no interest in practice.

Main category: nlin.SI

TL;DR: A simple algebraic method is developed to construct traveling wave solutions for the Burgers hierarchy, leveraging the Cole-Hopf transformation. This method is effective for higher equations where direct integration isn't practical. For the Burgers equation, the diffusion term counteracts nonlinearity to produce smooth waves. Higher-order equations in the hierarchy show solutions that are smooth and identical across orders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding traveling wave solutions for PDEs, especially in the Burgers hierarchy, is crucial for modeling nonlinear phenomena in fluid dynamics, traffic flow, and other fields. Developing efficient methods to construct these solutions is of great interest.

Method: The method utilizes the Cole-Hopf transformation in an innovative way to simplify the construction of traveling wave solutions for the Burgers hierarchy. By judiciously applying this transformation, the method effectively handles cases where direct integration isn't feasible.

Result: 1. The method successfully generates traveling wave solutions for higher-order equations in the Burgers hierarchy. 2. For the Burgers equation, the diffusion term counteracts nonlinearity to produce smooth waves. 3. Higher-order equations in the hierarchy exhibit solutions that are smooth and identical across orders.

Conclusion: The Cole-Hopf-based algebraic method provides a reliable and efficient approach for constructing traveling wave solutions in the Burgers hierarchy, offering insights into the interplay between nonlinearity and diffusion in these equations.

Abstract: We emphasize that construction of travelling wave solutions for partial differential equations is a problem of considerable interest and thus introduce a simple algebraic method to generate such solutions for equations in the Burgers hierarchy. Our method based on a judicious use of the well known Cole-Hopf transformation is found to work satisfactorily for higher Burgers equations for which the direct method of integration is inapplicable. For Burgers equation we clearly demonstrate how does the diffusion term in the equation counteract the nonlinearity to result in a smooth wave. We envisage a similar study for higher equations in the Buggers hierarchy and establish that (i) as opposed to the solution of the Burgers equation, the purely nonlinear terms of these equations support smooth solutions and more interestingly (ii) the complete solutions of all higher-order equations are identical.

Abstract: This article surveys the noncommutative-geometric (NCG) approach to fundamental physics, in which geometry is encoded spectrally by a generalized Dirac operator and where dynamics arise from the spectral action. I review historically how the simple idea of marrying a Riemannian manifold to a two point space, progressed to lead to the uniqueness of the Standard Model and beyond. I explain how inner fluctuations of the Dirac operator reconstruct the full gauge-Higgs sector of the Standard Model on an almost-commutative space, fixing representations and hypercharges and naturally accommodating right-handed neutrinos and the see-saw mechanism. On the gravitational side, the heat-kernel expansion of the spectral action yields the cosmological constant, Einstein--Hilbert term, and higher-curvature corrections, with volume-quantized variants clarifying the status of $Λ$. I discuss the renormalization-group interpretation of the spectral action as a high-scale boundary condition, phenomenological implications for Higgs stability and neutrino masses. I present generalized Heisenberg equation leading to identify the NCG space at unification. I conclude by emphasizing that NCG provides a unified, testable, and geometrically principled quantum framework, linking matter, gauge fields, and gravity.

Abstract: The seminal work of Coleman, Glaser, and Martin established that, at zero temperature, any non-trivial solution to the equations of motion with the least Euclidean action is $O(D)$-symmetric. This paper extends their foundational analysis to finite temperature. We rigorously prove that for a broad class of scalar potentials, any saddle-point configuration with the least action is necessarily $O(D\!-\!1)$-symmetric and monotonic in the spatial directions. This result provides a firm mathematical justification for the symmetry properties widely assumed in studies of thermal vacuum decay and cosmological phase transitions.

Abstract: In superdimension $(2|2)$ there are only three non-Abelian Lie superalgebras admitting non-degenerate ad-invariant supersymmetric metric, the well-known Lie superalgebra $gl(1|1)$, and two more, $({\C}^3 + \A)$ and $({\C}_0^5 +{\A})$. After a brief review of the construction of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models based on the $GL(1|1)$ and $(C^3 + A)$ Lie supergroups, we proceed to construct the WZW model on the $({C}_0^5 +{A})$ Lie supergroup. Unfortunately, this model does not include the super Poisson-Lie symmetry. In the following, three new exact conformal field theories of the WZW type are constructed by gauging an anomaly-free subgroup SO(2) of the Lie supergroups mentioned above. The most interesting indication of this work is that the gauged WZW model on the supercoset $(C^3 + A)/$SO(2) has super Poisson-Lie symmetry; most importantly, its dual model is conformally invariant at the one-loop order, and this is presented here for the first time. Finally, in order to study the Yang-Baxter (YB) deformations of the $({C}_0^5 +{A})$ WZW model we obtain the inequivalent solutions of the (modified) graded classical Yang-Baxter equation ((m)GCYBE) for the $({\C}_0^5 +{\A})$ Lie superalgebra. Then, we classify all possible YB deformations for the $({C}_0^5 +{A})$ and settle also the issue of an one-loop conformality of the deformed backgrounds. The classification results are important, in particular in the Lie supergroup case they are rare, much hard technical work was needed to obtain them.

Abstract: We discuss the strong version of the consistency conditions for SRRT inflation in general two-field cosmological models. In the fiducial case, this condition is a geometric PDE which relates the scalar field metric and scalar potential of such models. When supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions, this equation determines the scalar field metric in terms of the scalar potential or the other way around, thereby selecting "fiducial" models for strong SRRT inflation. When the scalar potential is given, the equation can be simplified by fixing the conformal class of the scalar field metric, in which case it locally becomes an equation for the conformal factor of that metric when written in isothermal coordinates. We analyze this equation with standard methods of PDE theory, discuss its quasilinearization near a non-degenerate critical point of the scalar potential and extract natural asymptotic conditions for its solutions near such points.

Our framework is fully compositional in spacetime and extends previous results on the measurement of instantaneous observables.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 在研究O(N)模型在半无穷空间内的1/N展开时，S. Giombi和H. Khanchandani运用了共形场论在反德萨斯空间的框架。他们给出了O(1/N)修正项的系列展开式，用于边界异常维度。尽管他们无法解析地简化或求和该系列，但仍通过数值验证了该表达式与早先给出的简单解析式一致。本论文显示，他们在论文中提供的系列展开式实际上与早前表达式完全等效。然而，他们论文中引用的等式(4.57)（基于两种不同的3F2函数）未能正确生成数值值，因而我们在附录中重新推导了正确的基于两种3F2函数的公式。我们还对普通相变和特殊相变情况进行了相似性与差异性的评论，并对包括异常相变在内的所有情况提供了详细的异常维度推导，这些内容在我们早期发表的论文中未提及。

Motivation: 该研究是为了更深入地理解O(N)模型在半无穷空间内的相变，特别是在共形场论框架下的1/N展开行为。研究的结果意味着虽然理论推导存在复杂性，但其核心预测结果是一致的，这在理论上具有重要意义。

Method: 该研究采用共形场论和反德萨斯空间框架下的1/N展开方法，运用系列展开式和数值计算来验证理论结果的一致性。

Result: 研究结果表明，论文中提供的系列展开式与早前的解析表达式等效，并推导出了一种新的正确公式。数值计算验证了早前表达式的正确性，而原来的等式(4.57)存在计算错误。

Conclusion: 这项研究补充了早期关于O(N)模型相变的研究，确认了在半无穷空间中的1/N展开的有效性，提供了更精确的表达式，具有重要的理论价值。

Abstract: In a recent paper [JHEP 11 (2020) 118], S. Giombi and H. Khanchandani studied the 1/N expansion of the O(N) model in semi-infinite space within the framework of conformal field theory in anti-de Sitter space. They presented a series expansion for the O(1/N) correction to the boundary anomalous dimension in the case of the ordinary transition. Although they were unable to sum the series or simplify its form analytically, they demonstrated numerically that their result matches our earlier, simple analytic expression given in Prog. Theor. Phys. 70 (1983) 1226. In this paper, we show that their series expansion is in fact exactly equivalent to our original expression. However, since the final formula in eq. (4.57) of their paper, which is expressed in terms of two different 3F2 functions, cannot produce the correct values, we derive the correct formulae involving two 3F2 functions in the Appendices. We comment on the similarity and difference between their analysis and ours in the cases of the ordinary and special transitions, and present full details of deriving the anomalous dimension for all the cases including the extraordinary transition, which were not written in our earlier paper.

Result: 结果表明，当电荷超过临界值时，路径积分的相位会从实数变为虚数的$i^{3}$，这一结果与2维积lyphicon规范降低后的结果相符。

Conclusion: 这项研究为4维 charged Nariai 解路径积分的相位计算提供了明确的理论框架，并展示了2维积imating规范的方法在更高维度中的适用性。

Abstract: In this note, we compute the phase of the one-loop Euclidean path integral around charged Nariai solutions in 4 dimensions, including both metric and gauge field fluctuations. These solutions have a $S^{2} \times S^{2}$ geometry, and a magnetic flux in one of the spheres. For charges smaller than a critical value, the phase matches the result for the uncharged Nariai solution, and for charges bigger than that value, the phase is $i^{3}$. Our analytical calculation in the full 4D geometry matches the result obtained recently within a 2D dilaton gravity reduction. Along the way, we also develop a method of dealing with residue zero modes in the de Donder gauge.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we systematically treat the ambiguities that generically arise in the gradient expansion of any hydrodynamic theory. While these ambiguities do not affect the physical content of the equations, they induce two types of transformations in the space of transport coefficients. The first type is known as the 'frame' transformations, and amounts to field redefinitions. The second type, which we introduce and formalise here, we term the 'on-shell' transformations. This identifies equivalence classes of hydrodynamic theories that provide an equally valid low-energy description of the underlying microscopic theory. We show that in any (classical) theory of hydrodynamics (at arbitrary order in derivatives), the action of such transformations on the dispersion relations and two-point correlation functions is universal. We explicitly construct invariants which can then be matched to a microscopic theory. Among them are, expectedly, the low-momentum expansions of the hydrodynamic modes. The (unphysical) gapped modes can, however, be added or removed at will. Finally, we show that such transformations assign a nilpotent Lie group to every hydrodynamic theory, and discuss the related algebraic properties underlying classical hydrodynamics.

Abstract: The Liouville theorem states that classical time evolution is an incompressible flow in phase space. We investigate two formulations of classical mechanics in which this property is manifested. First, the traditional Hamilton-Jacobi theory provides an in-out formalism. Second, a recent idea employing an exponential representation of time evolution provides an in-in formalism. Through concrete examples, it is demonstrated that the on-shell action in the former and the exponential generator in the latter are disparate objects. Still, a concrete relation between the two is identified in terms of a matching calculation. A strictly classical derivation and formulation of classical scattering theory is provided.

Abstract: We review a new perspective on higher-spin holography, whereby Vasiliev's 4D higher-spin gravity emerges together with a 3D counterpart, consisting of coloured conformal matter fields coupled to topological conformal higher-spin and colour gauge fields, as two distinct reductions, characterised by dual structure groups, of a common parent model. The latter is given by a non-commutative AKSZ sigma model consisting on-shell of a flat superconnection valued in a fractional-spin extension of Fradkin-Vasiliev's higher-spin algebra. In particular, we highlight an intermediate 4D reduction, referred to fractional-spin gravity, consisting of exotic matter, in the form of coloured singletons, coupled to higher-spin and colour gauge fields.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Two fundamentally distinct quantities are both called "eikonal" in present amplitudes literature. The unitarity of the S-matrix ensures it can be written as the exponential of a Hermitian operator. The eikonal generator or Magnusian, which is the classical limit of the expectation value of that operator, generates all scattering observables. The leading order classical behavior of the phase of S-matrix elements is called the eikonal phase, and it coincides with the classical on-shell action. We demonstrate that the eikonal generator (Magnusian) and the eikonal phase (classical on-shell action) are inequivalent and find the exact general relationship between them. That relationship explains the special case of integrable scattering in which the two do coincide up to a Legendre transformation and explains why such a correspondence fails in general when spin or radiation are included.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the functional renormalization group (RG) and the dual holography framework in the path integral formulation, highlighting how each can be understood as a manifestation of the other. Rather than employing the conventional functional RG formalism, we consider a functional RG equation for the probability distribution function, where the RG flow is governed by a Fokker-Planck-type equation. The central idea is to reformulate the solution of Fokker-Planck type functional RG equation in a path integral representation. Within the semiclassical approximation, this leads to a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for an effective renormalized on-shell action. We then examine our framework for an Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a scalar field. Applying standard techniques, we derive a corresponding functional RG equation for the distribution function, where the dual holographic path integral serves as its formal solution. By synthesizing these two perspectives, we propose a generalized dual holography framework in which the RG flow is explicitly incorporated into the bulk effective action. This generalization naturally introduces RG $β$-functions and reveals that the RG flow of the distribution function is essentially identical to that of the functional RG equation.
