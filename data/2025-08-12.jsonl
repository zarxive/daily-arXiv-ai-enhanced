Indeed, most large scale\nexperiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium\ndynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general\nextremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing\npotential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed\ndifferent characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking\nand false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we\nobserve real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional\nU(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we\ndemonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string\nfragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering\nprocesses with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes.\nUtilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon\nquenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an\nextensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order\ncorrelations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly\ncorrelated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions\nbetween heavy ions.

To understand such electrostatically-driven\nsolvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a\nsolvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in\nclassic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in\nsimulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded\npoint charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to\nsingular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a\nrealistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields\nits embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However,\nthis core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent\ndensity that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In\nthis work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed\ntest charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted\nanywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite\nenergies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations\nin the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is\nlinear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for\nsolvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian\ncharges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the\ntheories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian\ntest charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric\nresponse in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically\npredict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar\nsolutes."}

It is not easy to develop a\ncoherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard\nGeneral Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of\nthe very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm\nbasis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which\nInflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\\,$ this, of course, includes the\nvast majority of such theories -- $\\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that\nspacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is\ncompletely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the\n``Hubble field'' must be isotropic.

We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far\nthe most natural way to accommodate such observations.

We report here on a spectroscopic measurement of the $c$\n$^3\\Sigma_g^+\\leftarrow a$ $^3\\Sigma_u^+$ electronic transition of $^4$He$_2$\nat a precision ($\\Delta \\nu/\\nu$) of $2.5\\times 10^{-10}$ and with full\nresolution of the rotational, spin-spin and spin-rotational fine structures.\nThe investigation focuses on transitions to the rotational levels of the $c$\n$^3\\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ state, located energetically above the He$(1$ $^1S_0) +\n$He$(2$ $^3S_1)$ dissociation limit and decaying by tunneling predissociation\nthrough a barrier in the $c$ state.

The new\ndata were combined with data from earlier measurements of the spectrum of the\n$c-a$ band system of $^4$He$_2$ to derive full sets of molecular constants for\nthe $a$ $^3\\Sigma_u^+(v=0)$ and $c$ $^3\\Sigma_g^+(v=4)$ states with much\nimproved precision over previous experimental results. A pronounced broadening\nof the linewidths of the transitions to the $c$ $^3\\Sigma_g^+(v=4,N=10)$\nfine-structure levels is attributed to tunneling predissociation through a\nbarrier in the potential of the $c$ state and is quantitatively accounted for\nby calculations of the predissociation widths."}

We present an\niterative time calibration method based on Markov Chains, suitable for detector\nsystems with multiple readout channels.

This solution differs from the well-known\nMcVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends\non the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with\nthe expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or\nduring inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the\nsupermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes\nsuggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the\ncosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters\nthe epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour\nof black holes around different future singularities are carefully\ninvestigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the\ntidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended\nobject, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.\n  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside\nthe black hole is a sphere with a finite radius.

In this paper, we investigate the\nestimation precision of the distance between two incoherent point sources with\narbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging system.

We\nextend these phase-transition phenomena to random quantum circuits with unital\nnoise, showing that constant-depth noisy circuits do not shrink the trace\ndistance on average, even when given highly entangled states as input. In\ncontrast, even at $\\log\\log n$ depth, the average trace distance can become\nsuperpolynomially small.\n  Finally, we explore moments of contraction for f-divergences and discuss\napplications to local differential privacy, demonstrating that noise regimes\nensuring privacy can render outputs essentially indistinguishable on average.\nThus, our results provide a fine-grained framework to quantify typical channel\nnoise in quantum information and computation and unveil new phenomena in\ncontraction coefficients, such as phase transitions for average contraction."}

In\nall other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state."}

Experiments\ngenerally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a\nprotective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate\nproperties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices,\nheterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching,\nwhich has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are\nprimarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes,\nlimiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal\nscanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in\nvdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with\nnanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an\nelectric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate\ncharge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport\nmeasurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability\noscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics."}

In this paper, we analyze\nthe noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to\nidentify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio.\nHence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal\noperating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators,\nmodify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality\nbased on simulated data.

These states are, in principle, distinguished by\nquantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state\nand characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we\nsystematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass\nstates using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which\ninterpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and\nisotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of\nthe Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the\ntransition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We\nshow that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling\nwith $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions\nsystematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass\nregime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin\ninteractions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic\ncase, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase\nbefore entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights\ninto quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them."}
