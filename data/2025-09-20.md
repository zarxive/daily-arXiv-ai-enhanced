### [1] [Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14248)
*Yu Wang,Ruihao Bi,Wei Liu,Jiayue Han,Wenjie Dou*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: The paper discusses the realization of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) using chiral molecular junctions and explores spin transport dynamics in such systems using quantum master equation (QME) methods combined with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to include electron-phonon coupling. The results show that spin polarization is transient and decays to zero at long times, with bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly affecting spin current dynamics. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage characteristics but leaves polarization dynamics largely unchanged. These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spintronic devices with high efficiency and low power are highly desired, and CISS offers a promising approach to achieve this without external magnetic fields. Understanding spin transport dynamics in molecular junctions is essential for designing such devices.

Method: This study combines quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to incorporate electron-phonon coupling.

Result: The results of the study indicate that spin polarization in CISS systems is transient and ultimately decays to zero. The bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly influence the spin current dynamics. Higher bias enhances spin current but reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies the current-voltage characteristics but does not significantly affect the polarization dynamics.

Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of spin transport dynamics in chiral molecular junctions and highlights the interplay between electronic and vibrational effects. The findings offer guidance for the design of molecular spintronic devices, contributing to the development of efficient and low-power spintronic technologies.

Abstract: Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing
chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without
external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions
by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic
dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to
incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin
polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that
bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly
influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but
reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient
polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage
characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing
them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged.
These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational
effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic
devices.

### [2] [Theory of Sondheimer magneto-oscillations beyond semiclassical limit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14315)

Result: 揭示了散斑现象层级结构，分析振幅和频率如何依赖于物理参数。

Conclusion: 为薄金属薄膜的束缚运输提供了系统性的表征方法。

Abstract: In conducting films subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, electron
motion along the field direction gives rise to conductance oscillations
periodic in field intensity - a phenomenon known as Sondheimer oscillations.
Traditionally, these oscillations were understood within the semiclassical
framework of kinetic theory. However, their behavior in the quantum regime
(i.e. at strong fields and weak disorder) remains unclear, particularly due to
potential interference with quantum Shubnikov-de Haas magneto-oscillations. In
this work, we develop a comprehensive theory of quantum magnetoconductivity
oscillations in metallic films of finite thickness, fully capturing the
interplay between the Sondheimer and Shubnikov-de Haas effects beyond the
semiclassical limit. By treating surface scattering, in-plane Landau
quantization, and dimensional confinement along the magnetic field direction on
equal footing, we reveal an intricate hierarchy of oscillation patterns and
characterize how their amplitudes and frequencies depend on various physical
parameters. Our results pave the way for systematic characterization of thin
metallic films with boundary-dominated transport properties.

### [3] [Density Dependence of the Phases of the $ν= 1$ Integer Quantum Hall Plateau in Low Disorder Electron Gases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14459)

Conclusion: 深入了解低无序电子系统的局域态行为及其能隙特征。

Abstract: Recent magnetotransport measurements in low-disorder electron systems
confined to GaAs/AlGaAs samples revealed that the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum
Hall plateau is broken into three distinct regions. These three regions were
associated with two phases with different types of bulk localization: the
Anderson insulator is due to random quasiparticle localization, and the integer
quantum Hall Wigner solid is due to pinning of a stiff quasiparticle lattice.
We highlight universal properties of the $\nu = 1$ plateau: the structure of
the stability diagram, the non-monotonic dependence of the activation energy on
the filling factor, and the alignment of features of the activation energy with
features of the stability regions of the different phases are found to be
similar in three samples spanning a wide range of electron densities. We also
discuss quantitative differences between the samples, such as the dependence of
the onset temperature and the activation energy of the integer quantum Hall
Wigner solid on the electron density. Our findings provide insights into the
localization behavior along the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum Hall plateau in the
low disorder regime.

Abstract: Laughlin charge pumping has provided critical insights into the topological
classification of individual materials, but remains largely unexplored in
topological junctions. We explore Laughlin charge pumping in junctions composed
of a chiral topological superconductor sandwiched between two quantum anomalous
Hall insulators, driven by an adiabatically varying magnetic flux. Here, charge
pumping can be mediated merely by chiral Dirac modes or by the interplay of
chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes (CMMs). In the former case, a variation
of one magnetic flux quantum induces the pumping of a unit charge, as the
chiral Dirac mode accumulates the full flux-induced phase. In contrast, in the
latter case, pumping a unit charge requires a variation of fractional magnetic
flux quanta, determined by the device geometry and the parity of the number of
enclosed superconducting vortices. This unique feature results from the
charge-neutral and zero-momentum nature of zero-energy CMMs. Our work offers an
experimentally viable pathway toward detecting CMMs and could also inspire
further research into Laughlin charge or spin pumping in diverse topological
junctions, which are now within experimental reach.

Abstract: The interaction between a particle's spin and momentum -- known as spin-orbit
(SO) coupling -- is the cornerstone of modern spintronics. In Bose-Einsten
condensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely
controlled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an
intrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the
photon modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled
exciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic
magnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure.
Inspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a
weakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We
discover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling
dynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with
dynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the
opposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results
demonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent
candidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with
prospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns.

### [6] [Emergent momentum-space topological pseudospin defects in non-Hermitian systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14605)
*Yow-Ming Robin Hu,Elena A. Ostrovskaya,Alexander Yakimenko,Eliezer Estrecho*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper discusses topological point defects in momentum space for 2D non-Hermitian systems, highlighting their emergence, stability across gapped and gapless phases, and potential experimental detection in exciton-polariton systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The success of topology in Hermitian systems motivates extension to non-Hermitian systems, exploring robustness of topological defects with imaginary parts.

Method: Analytically solve the eigenenergies of a non-Hermitian Dirac model and a hybrid light-matter model, mapping out trajectories and classifying defects by vorticity.

Result: Defects with opposite vorticity annihilate in gapped phases but remain protected in gapless phases due to non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies.

Conclusion: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit topological defects that offer new avenues for classifying and utilizing topological phases, with implications for future experiments in platforms like optical microcavities.

Abstract: Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to
photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information
processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that
spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum
space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective
Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model
and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles -
exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the
eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two
distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the
trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological
winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite
vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are
protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies
(exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the
signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an
exciton-polariton system.

### [7] [Three-Dimensional Domain-Wall Membranes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14679)
*Jacob Mankenberg,Artem Abanov*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: A geometric theory for analyzing three-dimensional magnetic textures is presented, enabling the study of their energetics, deformation modes, and collective behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complex behavior of three-dimensional magnetic textures is crucial for advancing materials science and spintronics applications.

Method: The researchers developed an effective geometric theory by modeling magnetic textures as two-dimensional domain-wall membranes. They used a local ansatz to represent the magnetization and integrated out the internal profile to derive a two-dimensional energy functional. Additionally, they constructed a local formula for the Hopf index to explore the coupling between geometry and topology.

Result: The theory successfully demonstrates its utility by analyzing a flat membrane hosting a vortex and a toroidal Hopfion, providing analytic solutions for the wall thickness profile, energetics, and confirming the Hopf index formula. The framework is versatile and can incorporate additional interactions.

Conclusion: This work provides a valuable tool for understanding the intricate relationship between geometry, topology, and micromagnetics in three-dimensional spin systems, opening new avenues for research in complex magnetic textures.

Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic textures, such as Hopfions, torons, and skyrmion
tubes, possess rich geometric and topological structure, but their detailed
energetics, deformation modes, and collective behavior are yet to be fully
understood. In this work, we develop an effective geometric theory for general
three-dimensional textures by representing them as embedded two-dimensional
orientable domain-wall membranes. Using a local ansatz for the magnetization in
terms of membrane coordinates, we integrate out the internal domain-wall
profile to obtain a reduced two-dimensional energy functional. This functional
captures the coupling between curvature, topology, and the interplay of
micromagnetic energies, and is expressed in terms of a small set of soft-mode
fields: the local wall thickness and in-plane magnetization angle.
Additionally, we construct a local formula for the Hopf index which sheds light
on the coupling between geometry and topology for nontrivial textures. We
analyze the general properties of the theory and demonstrate its utility
through the example of a flat membrane hosting a vortex as well as a toroidal
Hopfion, obtaining analytic solutions for the wall thickness profile,
associated energetics, and a confirmation of the Hopf index formula. The
framework naturally extends to more complex geometries and can accommodate
additional interactions such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Zeeman, and other
anisotropies, making it a versatile tool for exploring the interplay between
geometry, topology, and micromagnetics in three-dimensional spin systems.

### [8] [Spin-photon coupling using circular double quantum dots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14813)

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular
double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic
g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective
theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the
magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of
odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and
antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates
can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a
high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic
field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For
low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite
spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling
becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum
dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital
states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a
second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which
lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial
spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be
switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or
magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.

Conclusion: 研究表明，垂直堆叠的量子点结构对其自旋相干性有显著影响。增加层数可调节自旋相干时间与松弛时间，为量子信息应用提供了可行性设计的方向。

Abstract: We investigate the spin properties of charge carriers in vertically coupled
InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy, emitting at telecom
C-band wavelengths, with a silicon $\delta$-doped layer. Using time-resolved
pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we systematically study single-,
two-, and four-layer quantum dot (QD) configurations to quantify how vertical
coupling affects key spin-coherence parameters. Our measurements reveal
distinct layer-dependent effects: (1) Adding a second QD layer flips the
resident charge from electrons to holes, consistent with optically induced
electron tunneling into lower-energy dots and resultant hole charging. (2)
Starting from the four-layer sample, the pump-probe signal develops an
additional non-oscillating, decaying component absent in single- and two-layer
samples, attributed to multiple layer growth changing the strain environment,
which reduces heavy-hole and light-hole mixing. (3) With four-layers or more,
hole spin mode locking (SML) can be observed, enabling quantitative extraction
of the hole coherence time $T_2 \approx 13$\,ns from SML amplitude saturation.
We also extract longitudinal spin relaxation ($T_1$) and transverse ($T_2^*$)
spin dephasing times, g-factors, and inhomogeneous dephasing parameters for
both electrons and holes across all layer configurations. The hole spin
dephasing times $T_2^*$ remain relatively constant (2.26-2.73\,ns) across layer
counts, while longitudinal relaxation times $T_1$ decrease with increasing
layers (from 1.03\,$\mu$s for single-layer to 0.31\,$\mu$s for four-layer
samples). These findings provide potential design guidelines for engineering
spin coherence in telecom-band QDs for quantum information applications.

Abstract: Magnetically controlled states in quantum materials are central to their
unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, direct momentum-resolved
visualization of these states via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) has been hindered by the disruptive effect of magnetic fields on
photoelectron trajectories. Here, we introduce an \textit{in-situ} method that
is, in principle, capable of applying magnetic fields up to 1 T. This method
uses substrates composed of nanomagnetic metamaterial arrays with alternating
polarity. Such substrates can generate strong, homogeneous, and spatially
confined fields applicable to samples with thicknesses up to the micron scale,
enabling ARPES measurements under magnetic fields with minimal photoelectron
trajectory distortion. We demonstrate this minimal distortion with ARPES data
taken on monolayer graphene. Our method paves the way for probing magnetic
field-dependent electronic structures and studying field-tunable quantum phases
with state-of-the-art energy-momentum resolutions.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Moiré superlattices in WSe₂/Widom stacking enable the creation of exotic quantum states like quadrupolar trions through controlled interlayer coupling and hybridized moiré potentials. These trions exhibit vanishing electric dipole moments, making them potential candidates for spin-photon interactions. Optimal electric field tuning can enhance Coulomb repulsion, driving transitions between interlayer and intralayer Mott states. The asymmetric stacking further expands the system's potential for coherent quantum light manipulation by enriching excitonic selection rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of intricate quantum states in moiré superlattices is crucial for advancing our understanding of topological phases and potential applications in quantum information processing. This research offers a platform for exploring and controlling exotic quantum phenomena like trions and their interactions with light.

Method: The researchers engineered a bichromatic moiré superlattice by combining bilayers of mismatched moiré wavelengths. The system's properties, such as quadrupolar trions and their interactions, were deduced through theoretical analysis and experiments involving electric field tuning.

Result: The system exhibits quadrupolar trions with unique properties, including vanishing dipole moments, tunable Coulomb repulsion through electric fields, and enhanced Mott transitions. The asymmetric stacking also provides new excitonic selection rules, potentially paving the way for spin-photon engineering applications.

Conclusion: This work opens new avenues for studying exotic quantum states in moiré superlattices through tailored structural design. It lays the foundation for exploring and controlling quantum phenomena relevant for future quantum technologies.

Abstract: Moir\'{e} superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures
provide a platform to engineer many-body interactions. Here, we realize a
bichromatic moir\'{e} superlattice in an asymmetric WSe$_2$/WS$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterotrilayer by combining R- and H-stacked bilayers with mismatched moir\'{e}
wavelengths. This structure hosts fermionic quadrupolar moir\'{e} trions --
interlayer excitons bound to an opposite-layer hole -- with vanishing dipole
moments. These trions arise from hybridized moir\'{e} potentials enabling
multiple excitonic orbitals with tunable interlayer coupling, allowing control
of excitonic and electronic ground states. We show that an out-of-plane
electric field could effectively reshape moir\'{e} excitons and
interlayer-intralayer electron correlations, driving a transition from
interlayer to intralayer Mott states with enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The
asymmetric stacking further enriches excitonic selection rules, broadening
opportunities for spin-photon engineering. Our results demonstrate bichromatic
moir\'{e} superlattices as a reconfigurable platform for emergent quantum
states, where quadrupolar moir\'{e} trion emission may enable coherent and
entangled quantum light manipulation.

### [12] [Zero Indirect Band Gap in Non-Hermitian Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15102)
*Rahul S,Giandomenico Palumbo*

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically unstable and achievable only through fine-tuning. However, recent works have revealed robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems with indirect gaps pinned at zero. This study extends the concept to non-Hermitian lattice models by examining a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss, demonstrating that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations. Additionally, the research identifies the conditions under which this stability persists and finds that the zero indirect gap leads to a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect, a phenomenon not previously discussed. The findings highlight new connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points, and the non-Hermitian skin effect, with potential experimental realizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to explore the stability of indirect band gaps in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. By extending previous findings on Hermitian systems to non-Hermitian lattice models, the researchers aim to uncover new effects and mechanisms, such as the suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect, which could have significant implications for material science and the design of novel materials with specific electronic properties.

Method: The researchers used theoretical modeling and analysis of a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. They employed techniques from condensed matter physics, including band structure analysis and the consideration of non-Hermitian operators, to investigate the stability of the zero indirect band gap under non-Hermitian perturbations. The study likely involved solving the Schrödinger equation for the system and analyzing the resulting energy bands and wavefunctions.

Result: The key results of the study indicate that a zero indirect band gap can indeed remain stable against non-Hermitian perturbations in a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss. The researchers identified the parameter ranges where this stability persists and demonstrated that the zero indirect gap induces a suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect. This finding contributes to the understanding of the behavior of indirect gaps in non-Hermitian systems and offers new insights into the interplay between indirect gaps, exceptional points, and the non-Hermitian skin effect.

Conclusion: In conclusion, this research successfully extends the concept of robust semimetallic phases with zero indirect band gaps to non-Hermitian lattice models. By examining a one-dimensional diamond-like system with gain and loss, the researchers confirmed the stability of the zero indirect band gap under non-Hermitian perturbations and identified the conditions for its persistence. Furthermore, they discovered a novel suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect induced by the zero indirect gap, which bridges previously unexplored connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points, and the non-Hermitian skin effect. These findings have important implications for the design and application of materials with controlled electronic properties in the field of non-Hermitian condensed matter physics.

Abstract: Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and
achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed
robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains
pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to
non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system
with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable
against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this
robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a
suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical
mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new
connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin
effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.

Abstract: The sharp increase in resistivity of copper interconnects at ultra-scaled
dimensions threatens the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits.
Topological semimetals (TSMs) with gapless surface states (Fermi arcs) provide
conduction channels resistant to localization. Here we develop an efficient
computational framework to quantify 0K surface-state transmission in nanowires
derived from Wannier tight-binding models of topological conductors that
faithfully reproduce relativistic density functional theory results. Sparse
matrix techniques enable scalable simulations incorporating disorder and
surface roughness, allowing systematic materials screening across sizes,
chemical potentials, and transport directions. A dataset of 3000 surface
transmission values reveals TiS, ZrB$_{2}$, and nitrides AN where A=(Mo, Ta, W)
as candidates with conductance matching or exceeding copper and benchmark TSMs
NbAs and NbP. This dataset further supports machine learning models for rapid
interconnect compound identification. Our results highlight the promise of
topological conductors in overcoming copper's scaling limits and provide a
roadmap for data-driven discovery of next-generation interconnects.

Abstract: This work addresses non-classically damped coupled oscillators with closely
spaced modes focusing on the physics of modal interactions. Considering the
simplest representative example in the form of an impulsively excited
two-degree-of-freedom (two-DOF) system, we show that there is a single
parameter defined as a coupling versus damping non-proportionality ratio, that
separates two different dynamical regimes. Based on complexification-averaging
analysis, we show that, below the critical value of this parameter, the system
response possesses two distinct dissipation rates but only one frequency of
oscillation; as a result, energy is slowly exchanged between modes in a single
beat phenomenon. However, above the critical parameter value, the response has
a single dissipation rate but two distinct oscillation frequencies; this yields
an infinity of beat phenomena as energy is interchanged at a faster rate
between modes. Our analytical predictions are fully validated by experimental
measurements. Our findings highlight the physics of modal interactions in
coupled oscillators and provide a framework for system identification and
reduced-order modeling of systems with closely spaced modes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Pyrene-functionalized materials are extensively employed in photoluminescent
applications, owing to their extended pi-conjugation and favorable
photophysical properties. However, their luminescent performance is often
attenuated by pi-pi stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen
quenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of
7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the
1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in
solution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the
pyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this
work presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the
1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce
steric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of
pyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects
tune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7)
fluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging
from ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene
derivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In
addition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms
and alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is
reflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of
'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the
photophysical behaviours of annulenes, highlighting their applicability in
next-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: Estimates the impact of substituents in molecular motor rotors on their rotational speed using theoretical and computational methods. Results show that replacing a methyl group with a tBu group increases rotational speed due to reduced metastable state lifetime and further increases it by fluorinating the tBu group. Calculations also reveal significant changes in excitation wavelengths, with metastable states' absorption peaks separated by up to 40 nm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the factors affecting the rotational speed of molecular motors is crucial for their design and application in fields like nanomechanics and drug delivery.

Method: Theoretical calculations using harmonic transition state theory, combined with density functional theory for energy and atomic forces. The rate limiting step, thermal helix inversion, and competing backward transition were considered.

Result: Substituting a methyl group with a tBu group increases rotational speed. Further fluorination of the tBu group enhances this effect. The excitation wavelength of both stable and metastable states increases by up to 40 nm upon substitution.

Conclusion: The study provides a strategy for designing molecular motors with optimized rotational speeds tailored to specific applications by adjusting substituents in rotor groups.

Abstract: The effect of modifying substituents in the rotor group of five second
generation molecular motors is estimated by theoretical calculations. The
rotational speed is estimated by calculating the rate limiting step, the
thermal helix inversion, as well as the competing backward transition using
harmonic transition state theory with energy and atomic forces obtained from
density functional theory. First, a methyl group at the stereogenic center is
replaced with a tert-butyl (tBu) group and the rotational speed is found to
increase due to reduced lifetime of the metastable state. For two of the
rotors, comparison can be made with experimental measurements and the
calculated half-life is in close agreement. Secondly, the effect of
substituting the nine hydrogen atoms in the tBu group with fluorine atoms is
studied and this is found to increase the rotational rate further without
significantly altering the molecular structure. The excitation wavelength of
both the stable and metastable states is calculated and the separation of the
absorption peaks is found to increase by the tBu substitution and even more so
by the fluorinated tBu substitution, up to 40 nm. These findings can help
develop a strategy for designing molecular motors with a rotational speed that
best fits a given application.

Conclusion: 这一研究为光合作用光发射中复杂量子动力学机制提供了实验证据。未来研究应深入探索电子激发与振动模式之间动态作用关系，阐明光子能量传递的基本机制。这对开发高效人工光合作用系统具有潜在指导作用。

Abstract: Photosynthesis relies on efficient energy relaxation within the excited-state
manifold of pigment-protein complexes. Since the protein scaffold is rather
flexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a
complex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time
scales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is
known, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature
of the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single
pigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited
with two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave
packets that can interfere. This leads to a modulation of the emission
intensity as a function of the delay time between the pulses that fades out
within about 100 fs due to fluctuating environments on those time scales. For
several single complexes we find variations of the interference patterns on
time scale of several 10 s that reveal fluctuations in the energy relaxation
pathways towards the lowest-energy exciton states. This relaxation is driven by
temporal variations in the coupling between electronic excitations and
low-frequency vibrational modes.

Abstract: The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM)
coupled-cluster (CC) method with 4-hole--2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) excitations on
top of the CC with singles, doubles, and triples calculation, abbreviated as
DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), along with its perturbative
DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approximation, are extended to a relativistic
four-component (4c) framework. In addition, we introduce and test a new
computationally practical DIP-EOMCC approach, which we call
DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$), that approximates the treatment of
4$h$-2$p$ correlations within the DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a) (4$h$-2$p$) method and
reduces the $\mathscr{N}^8$ scaling characterizing DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and
DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) to $\mathscr{N}^7$ with the system size
$\mathscr{N}$. Further improvements in computational efficiency are obtained
using the frozen natural spinor (FNS) approximation to reduce the numbers of
unoccupied spinors entering the correlated steps of the DIP-EOMCC calculations
according to a well-defined occupation-number-based threshold. The resulting
4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCC approaches are used to compute DIPs for the series of inert
gas atoms from argon to radon as well as the vertical DIPs in \Cltwo{},
\Brtwo{}, HBr, and HI, which have been experimentally examined in the past. We
demonstrate that, when using complete basis set extrapolations and FNS
truncation thresholds of $10^{-4.5}$, the
4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$) calculations are capable of
predicting DIPs in agreement with experimental data, improving upon their
nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic counterparts, particularly
when examining DIPs characterized by stronger spin-orbit coupling effects.

Abstract: We report on the growth optimization of intentionally low-doped ($10^{15}$
$cm^{-3}$) high-quality $\beta-Ga_2O_3$ drift layers up to 10 $\mu m$ thick via
MOCVD and the fabrication of kilovolt-class field plated Schottky barrier
diodes on these thick drift layers. Homoepitaxial growth was performed on (010)
$10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ substrates using TMGa as the Ga precursor. Growth
parameters were systematically optimized to determine the best conditions for
high quality thick growths with the given reactor geometry. Chamber pressure
was found to improve the growth rate, mobility, and roughness of the samples.
Growth rates of up to 7.2 $\mu m$/hr., thicknesses of up to 10 $\mu m$, Hall
mobilities of up to 176 $cm^2$/Vs, RMS roughness down to 5.45 nm, UID
concentrations as low as $2 \times$ $10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$, and controllable

plated Schottky barrier diodes (FP-SBDs) were fabricated on a $6.5 \times$
$10^{15}$ $cm^{-3}$ intentionally doped 10 $\mu m$ thick film to determine the
electrical performance of the MOCVD-grown material. The FP-SBD was found to
have current density $>$100 A/$cm^2$ at 3 V forward bias with a specific
differential on resistance ($R_{on,sp}$) of 16.22 m$\Omega$.$cm^2$ and a turn
on voltage of 1 V. The diodes were found to have high quality anode
metal/semiconductor interfaces with an ideality factor of 1.04, close to unity.
Diodes had a maximum breakdown voltage of 1.50 kV, leading to a punch-through
maximum field of 2.04 MV/cm under the anode metal, which is a state-of-the-art
result for SBDs on MOCVD-grown (010) drift layers.

Abstract: This article discusses electromagnetic properties of volumetric metamaterial
samples with essentially discrete structure, that is, assembled as a periodic
array of electromagnetic resonators. We develop an efficient numerical
procedure for calculating quasi-static electromagnetic response precisely to
analyse samples containing several million meta-atoms. We demonstrate that,
contrary to a common belief, even million-``atoms'' samples with sharp edges
are still quite different from uniform (``homogenised'') materials, and their
properties are critically sensitive to their shape and boundary structure. We
also compare our results with calculations based on the discrete dipole
approximation as well as with an integral model for continuous particles, and
analyse distinctions and similarities between the different approaches. In
particular, discrete metamaterials present themselves as a stringent platform
for assessing continuous models developed for finite objects with sharp edges.
Overall, the reported results should be important for understanding mesoscopic
systems with strongly interacting elements.

TL;DR: A new method for designing functional metamaterials with continuous physical properties is proposed using spherical harmonics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenges of creating functional metamaterials by focusing on achieving smooth property distributions and continuous structures.

Method: The method uses spherical harmonics to represent stiffness spatial distributions, enabling stochastic generation of anisotropic infills with high continuity.

Result: The method improves the design of functional components with programmable responses, such as customized tissue support and information encoding.

Conclusion: This approach offers a promising solution for designing metamaterials with tailored functionalities while maintaining structural homogeneity.

Abstract: Natural materials, such as bones and wood, are structured with irregular
composites and exhibit smooth distribution of macroscopic physical properties
towards desired functionalities including withstanding mechanical forces,
energy absorption and modulated deformation. To extend beyond natural
synthesis, the design of functional metamaterials requires the solution of two
inverse problems, i.e., modulating the spatial distribution of physical
properties to achieve target functionalities, and generating geometric
structures to realize the desired physical property distribution. Until now,
realizing special functionalities from metamaterials primarily relies on the
process of joining individual 'building blocks' of functional materials, which
are deliberately designed to attain required responsive behaviors, such as the
non-uniform displacement field. However, the discontinuity of the physical
property distribution between the building blocks in the resulted structure,
often leads to problems such as excessive stress concentration in the joining
areas and limited design flexibility. To overcome the above problems, we
proposed a new method for automatic design of functional metamaterials to
achieve continuity in both geometry and physical properties. The fundamental
theory of the method is the incorporation of spherical harmonics to represent
and modulate the spatial distribution of stiffness, which then serves as a
non-uniform distribution function for stochastic generation of anisotropic
spinodal infills with high continuity. The proposed method have potential wide
applications for designing functional components with programmed responsive
behaviors, such as realizing customized tissue supporting and information
encoding.

focus on how geometry influences the charge transport behavior. Highly ordered
linear assemblies of Au@PANI nanoparticles were fabricated using
template-assisted assembly, while bulk-like films were obtained via
drop-casting. Temperature-dependent transport measurements were analyzed using
established theoretical models. Linear assemblies exhibit more localized
transport, characterized by variable-range hopping (VRH) and thermally assisted
tunneling (TAT), whereas bulk-like films show more delocalized transport,
dominated by Arrhenius-type and thermionic conduction. These findings highlight
the critical role of geometry in determining charge transport mechanisms in
nanoparticle-based hybrid systems.

Abstract: We extend the Euler-Bernoulli beam problem, formulated as a matrix string
equation with a matrix-valued density, to a setting where the density takes
values in a Clifford algebra, and we analyze its isospectral deformations. For
discrete densities, we prove that the associated matrix Weyl function admits a
Stieltjes-type continued fraction expansion with Clifford-valued coefficients.
By mapping the problem from the finite interval to the real line, we uncover a
direct link to a multi-component generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation.
This yields a vectorized form of the Camassa-Holm equation invariant under
arbitrary orthogonal group actions. As an illustration, we examine the dynamics
of a two-atom (two-peakon) matrix measure in the special case of a Clifford
algebra with two generators and Minkowski signature. Our analysis shows that,
even when peakon waves remain spatially separated, they can engage in
long-range, synchronized energy exchange.

Abstract: We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using
the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the
magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and
electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and
to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate
vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy
proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal
has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of
vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions,
their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in
charged crystals.

that the expectation value of the magnetic octupole moment is finite in the

an effective model with a full multiplet approach. While the intensity of the
XAS-MCD spectra vanishes, the XES-MCD spectra exhibit finite intensity, whose
spectrum becomes opposite by inverting the N\`eel vector. These results clearly

Abstract: We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium

Motivation: 研究Parquet方程在强相关材料中的应用及重要性

Method: 通过引入单孤子交换分解，将顶点方程转化为相联系的相 screened 内部和Hedin 顶点，以及剩余函数，从而避免了局域量子效应的问题

Result: 发现了fermionic particles' particle-particle和particle-hole极化图可以映射到two bosonic self-energy diagrams

Conclusion: 这种映射为理解和应用Parquet方程提供了新的视角并提高了其计算效率

Abstract: The parquet equations present a cornerstone of some of the most important
diagrammatic many-body approximations and methods currently on the market for
strongly correlated materials: from non-local extensions of the dynamical
mean-field theory to the functional renormalization group. The recently
introduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an
alternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions,
Hedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much
attention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for
avoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the
traditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its
built-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic
diagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped
to diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories
with pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened
interaction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis
for the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet
components is shown to recover the trace log theory known from
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we
revisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet
approximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening
approximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model. We comment on the role of the
self-energy and crossing symmetry in enforcing the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner
theorem in parquet-related approaches.

Motivation: 研究冷原子量子模拟器的最新实验证实，探索平方点阵上的玻色 $t$-$t'$-$J$ 模型，利用大量密度矩阵重整化群模拟。

Method: 通过调节掺杂度参数 $eta$ 和跃迁比 $t'/t$，在玻色 $t$-$t'$-$J$ 模型上发现六个不同的量子相，包括 PDW、SF*，以及相分层和铁磁有序等。

Result: 在反铁磁有序的存在下，掺入的holes被凝聚成配对，形成PDW相；在$ t'<0$时，这种配对被抑制，形成一个无序的PDW状态，没有单玻色子或配对的相干性。随着时间的推移，玻色子恢复相干性并形成SF*相，其在不可调和的磁有序共存下表现出特定的动量和磁性动量。在$t'>0$一侧，符号诱导的运动学阻碍反铁磁相关性，导致相分层；进一步掺入后，相分层发展为一致的SF + xy-Fe超级体。最后，该研究提供了通过玻色体阵发器实现$t'/t$正负的具体实验方案。这些结果揭示了掺入和相互作用下的竞争和交织秩序，对高温超导等核心问题很重要。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了玻色体系中的复杂量子相和相互作用，尤其是在掺入反铁磁背景时，发现了PDW、SF*、相分层和铁磁有序等多种有序状态，这为理解配位超导体等核心问题提供了深刻的理论框架和实验方案。

Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental advances in cold atom quantum simulators,
we explore the experimentally implemented bosonic $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the
square lattice using large-scale density matrix renormalization group
simulations. By tuning the doping level $\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we
uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the
conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic
systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped
holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW)
phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'<0$ side,
resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual
bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and
form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate
momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'>0$ side,
the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM
correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into
ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon
further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM
phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs
of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model
parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing
and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central
issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay
between doped holes and spin background.

Abstract: Dipole condensates, formed from particle-hole pairs, represent a unique class
of charge-neutral quantum fluids that evade conventional vector gauge fields,
making their electrodynamic responses difficult to probe in natural materials.
Here, we propose a tunable platform using strongly interacting two-component
ultracold atoms to realize dipole condensates and probe their coupling to
rank-2 electric fields. By applying spin-dependent forces and treating spin as
a synthetic dimension, we engineer a synthetic rank-2 electric field that
induces measurable electrodynamic responses. We identify the atomic analog of
perfect Coulomb drag: increasing intercomponent interactions leads to equal and
opposite displacements of the centers of mass of the two spin components.
Furthermore, a rank-2 electric field imprints a phase twist in the dipole
condensate and generates a supercurrent of dipoles that obeys the dipolar
Josephson relation -- a smoking gun for dipole condensation. Our results
establish a powerful platform for exploring dipolar superfluidity under tensor
gauge fields.

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: This paper investigates the quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in the presence of a substrate and Earth's gravity, revealing how the gravitational field influences the scattering properties and resonances of the system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the quantum behavior of ultracold atoms in external potentials is essential for advancing cold atom physics and has potential applications in quantum sensing and metrology.

Method: The researchers used theoretical modeling and computational simulations to analyze the scattering properties and resonances in the H-He film-substrate interaction with gravitational potential.

Result: The study reveals critical thicknesses where zero-energy resonances occur, leading to significant restructuring of the energy spectrum. The analysis also shows how inelastic effects, like ripplon coupling, impact the sticking coefficient of atoms near these resonances.

Conclusion: This work provides a detailed understanding of how gravitational fields affect ultracold atom systems, opening new avenues for studying atom-matter interactions and their applications.

Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined
potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate
and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the
gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length
for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium
film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the
combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect
leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of
gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth
controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical
thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of
the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate
non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling.
The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient
behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a
probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction
parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of modulational instability (MI) in a binary
Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling, confined to a deep optical
lattice. The system is modeled by a set of discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations.
Using linear stability analysis, we derive the explicit MI conditions for the
system, elucidating the critical and distinct roles played by spin-orbit
coupling, inter-species nonlinearity, and intra-species nonlinearity. Our
analysis, conducted for both unstaggered and staggered fundamental modes,
reveals markedly different instability landscapes for these two configurations.
The analytical predictions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations of
the full nonlinear dynamics, which vividly illustrate the spatiotemporal
evolution of wave amplitudes, phase coherence, and energy localization during
the instability process. The numerical results, obtained via a fourth-order
Runge-Kutta method, show excellent agreement with the linear stability theory
and provide a complete picture of the MI-induced pattern formation.

Abstract: We consider helicoidal spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in deep

of Bloch oscillation are found to be affected by the relative value of
helicoidal gauge potential and spin-orbit coupling, and mean-field interaction.
We examined that the decay of Bloch oscillation caused by mean-field
interaction can be managed by helicoidal spin-orbit coupling.

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-frame diffraction imaging method using a single XFEL electron beam to create four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable parameters, achieving time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color pulses spanning 1.8-2.7 nm. The scheme enables single exposure multi-frame imaging for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies have become increasingly prominent, driven by the need to capture real-time structural and dynamic changes in matter with extreme precision and detail. Current methods often struggle with the temporal resolution required to capture these processes, necessitating an innovative approach like the one described in this paper.

Method: The method involves using an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) of high brightness to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The pulses are generated using an optical klystron scheme to enhance FEL intensity and reduce undulator length, with the time delay tuned via a magnetic chicane between undulators. The approach employs the SHINE experiment as a test case, with simulations demonstrating the effectiveness and tunability of the proposed method.

Result: The method successfully achieves time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning a 0.9-nm wavelength range (1.8-2.7 nm), with precise control over both temporal and spectral parameters. These results significantly advance the field of ultrafast molecular and atomic imaging, offering the potential to capture highly dynamic processes with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The numerical simulations validate the theoretical design and practical implementation of the proposed scheme.

Conclusion: The proposed method represents a significant breakthrough in ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies, offering a simple, scalable, and high-brightness alternative to current pulse generation techniques. The ability to achieve multi-frame diffraction imaging in a single exposure opens new possibilities for exploring ultrafast processes in real-time, with wide-ranging applications in fields such as chemistry, physics, and materials science.

Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new
opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling
imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In
this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction
imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with
adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is
introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators.
The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with
various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate
the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative
results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL
pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme
enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure,
providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics
studies.

Abstract: We develop new methods for approximating conformal blocks as positive
functions times polynomials, with applications to the numerical bootstrap. We
argue that to obtain accurate bootstrap bounds, conformal block approximations
should minimize a certain error norm related to the asymptotics of dispersive
functionals. This error norm can be made small using interpolation nodes with
an appropriate optimal density. The optimal density turns out to satisfy a kind
of force-balance equation for charges in one dimension, which can be solved
using standard techniques from large-N matrix models. We also describe how to
use optimal density interpolation nodes to improve condition numbers inside the
semidefinite program solver SDPB. Altogether, our new approximation scheme and
improvements to condition numbers lead to more accurate bootstrap bounds with
fewer computational resources. They were crucial in the recent bootstrap study
of stress tensors in the 3d Ising CFT.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $\hat{Z}$ invariants of three-manifolds introduced by
Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa have influenced many areas of mathematics and physics.
However, their TQFT structure remains poorly understood. In this work, we
develop a framework of decorated $\mathrm{Spin}$-TQFTs and construct one based
on Atiyah-Segal-like axioms that computes the $\hat{Z}$ invariants. Central to
our approach is a novel quantization of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory
and a $\mathbb{Q}$-extension of the algebra of observables on the torus, from
which we obtain the torus state space of the $\hat{Z}$-TQFT. Using the torus
state space and topological invariance, we uniquely determine the $\hat{Z}$
invariants for negative-definite plumbed manifolds. Within this TQFT framework,
we establish gluing, rational surgery, partial surgery, satellite, and cabling
formulas, as well as explicit closed-form expressions for Seifert manifolds and
torus link complements. We also generalize these constructions to higher-rank
gauge groups.

Abstract: Models with classically degenerate vacua often support quasiclassical
configurations of nontrivial topology. In (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanics
with a double-well potential, for example, instantons induce mixing between the
two perturbative ground states in the purely bosonic case, while in the
supersymmetric version, the tunneling amplitude is suppressed.
  In this work, we investigate (1+1)-dimensional models featuring classically
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield saturated kinks with degenerate masses and
identical topology. Recent studies suggest that such kinks may undergo mixing
mediated by scalar-field instantons. We analyze this phenomenon in a
supersymmetric framework and demonstrate that, whereas mixing indeed occurs in
the bosonic theory, the presence of fermionic zero modes in the supersymmetric
case leads to the vanishing of the transition amplitude. To illustrate these
results, we examine two examples featuring Wess-Zumino models with two and four
supercharges. The latter example is motivated by the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg
superpotential. We also present a number of developments of instanton calculus
in the case of instantons in kink backgrounds.

Abstract: We study baby closed universes in AdS, focusing on the
Antonini-Sasieta-Swingle (AS$^2$) cosmology, which arises in the gravitational
description of partially entangled thermal states (PETS), as well as the
classical example of Maldacena-Maoz (MM). We show that the algebraic
formulation of AdS/CFT--and in particular the subregion-subalgebra
duality--provides a natural framework for describing such universes within the
standard AdS/CFT setting, phrased in terms of an operator algebra ${\cal M}$
and a state $\omega$ on that algebra, with no need to introduce observers. The
algebra encodes all physical operations in the closed universe, and, in
principle, all physical observables are obtainable from the pair $({\cal
M},\omega)$. Along the way, we propose a resolution to a puzzle raised by
Antonini and Rath (AR) and reinforced by recent arguments of Engelhardt and
Gesteau and a no-go theorem of Gesteau: that a semiclassical baby universe in
the AS$^2$ cosmology cannot be understood from the boundary in the usual
manner. Our analysis motivates an averaged large-$N$ limit as part of the
AdS/CFT dictionary and points toward a unified treatment of spacetimes of all
asymptotics in terms of operator algebras. Finally, our boundary descriptions
of closed universes indicate that for small but finite $G_N$ there should exist
a semiclassical description of a macroscopic closed universe, rather than a
one-dimensional Hilbert space, and we discuss weaknesses in arguments favoring
the latter.

functions unify the correlators of the lightest scalar operator in the
stress-tensor multiplet with those of all higher R-charge single-trace half-BPS
scalar operators, thereby extending previous results for four-point loop
integrands. At the integrated level, they are represented as sums of conformal
integrals with coefficients exhibiting ten-dimensional poles that combine
spacetime and R-charge distances. Our results show that higher-order poles are
captured by products of lower-point generating functions. We also extract new
OPE data on spinning structure constants, and compare these to
integrability-based computations, finding good agreement.

Abstract: Under conservative assumptions, it is established at a mathematical level of
rigor that if correlation functions of single trace operators in a sequence of
states of $O(N^0)$ energy of a two-sided holographic conformal field theory
admit a large $N$ limit, then they must be described a pure state in the large
$N$ Hilbert space of free field theory on two copies of vacuum AdS. This result
clarifies recent discussions concerning the possible emergence of a
semiclassical baby universe in the large $N$ limit of a low-energy partially
entangled thermal state. The proof heavily relies on dominated convergence
arguments from mathematical analysis. Some comments are also offered on the
relationship between various recently proposed ways of restoring the emergence
of the baby universe and the relaxation of different assumptions of the
theorem.

Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of
tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics,
for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field
actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given
a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak
g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak
g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how
some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an
extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the
difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10
dimensions.

Abstract: We consider properties of non-linear theories of a chiral 4-form gauge field
$A_4$ in ten space-time dimensions with an emphasis on a subclass of these
theories which are invariant under the $D = 10$ conformal symmetry. We show
that general results regarding a peculiar structure of duality-invariant
abelian gauge theories in four and six space-time dimensions do not extend to
non-linear chiral 4-form theories in ten dimensions. This discrepancy arises
primarily from the large number 81 of independent invariants constructible from
the self-dual part of the five-form field strength $F_5=dA_4$ in $D=10$, in
stark contrast to the single independent (fourth-order) invariants which are
building blocks of the actions in the lower dimensional cases. In particular,
unlike the $D=4$ and $D=6$ cases, where non-linear duality-invariant theories
can be viewed as stress-tensor ($T\overline T$-like) deformations of seed
theories, the flow equations in $D=10$ generally involve both stress-tensor
invariants and additional higher-order structures constructed from $F_5$. In
passing, we prove the equivalence of three Lagrangian formulations of
non-linear duality-invariant $p$-form theories: the PST, the
Ivanov-Nurmagambetov-Zupnik and the ``clone" one.

Abstract: We study the implications of non-invertible chiral symmetry in a
four-dimensional U(1) gauge theory coupled to massless fermions with
electromagnetic $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality. This is done by deriving the
Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly of massless QED in the dual frame that is used to
explicitly construct the symmetry defect operator as well as the conserved
two-form symmetry current. As expected, the non-invertible chiral symmetry is
covariant under the duality transformation. This has implications for
understanding the nature of kinetic and topological terms in the dual frame and
for axion electrodynamics. In particular, we show that to generate an axion
potential from a dyon loop, the one-form magnetic symmetry must be explicitly
broken by a mutually non-local charged state with nonzero pairwise helicity.

Result: 在经典层面，Carrollian和Galilean W_N-代数同构；量子层面，翻转收缩代数与Galilean代数同构，而对称收缩生成不同的量子Carrollian W_N-代数，其基结构常数与经典Carrollian W_N-代数一致，为研究Carrollian共形场理论的扩展对称性提供了工具。

Conclusion: 该研究通过自由场方法实现了W_N-代数的Carrollian收缩，澄清了不同收缩下代数的量子结构，为未来研究平空间共形场理论的应用提供了理论基础和工具。

Abstract: We study Carrollian contractions of $W_N$-algebras from a free-field
perspective. Using a contraction of the Miura transformation, we obtain
explicit free-field realizations of the resulting Carrollian $W_N$-algebras. At
the classical level, they are isomorphic to the Galilean $W_N$-algebras. In the
quantum case, we distinguish between two Carrollian constructions: a flipped
Carrollian contraction, where the time direction is reversed in one sector, and
a symmetric contraction. The flipped construction yields a quantum algebra
isomorphic to the Galilean one, whereas the symmetric construction produces a
distinct quantum Carrollian $W_N$-algebra whose basic structure constants are
identical to those of the classical Carrollian $W_N$-algebra. These algebras
provide a natural framework for studying extended symmetries in Carrollian
conformal field theories, motivated by recent developments in flat space
holography. Our construction provides tools for developing the representation
theory of Carrollian (and Galilean) $W_N$-algebras using free-field techniques.

Motivation: 理解化学势对量子场论中算符复杂性的影响。

Result: 当化学势为正时，Lanczos系数$b_n$从斜率$rac{	ext{π}}{	ext{β}}$变为$rac{2}{	ext{β}}$；$a_n$从接近零变为斜率为$-4	ext{β}$的线性下降；正向和双向指数衰减的功率谱分别对应二次和指数复杂度增长，且指数增长满足最大混沌界限。

Conclusion: 化学势的增加显著影响了算符复杂性，特别是在Krylov复杂度的研究中发现了一些重要的行为特征。

Abstract: We systematically investigate the Krylov complexity of fermionic fields in
Schr\"odinger field theory as the chemical potential is positive, validated by
the engineered Wightman power spectra. For non-positive chemical potentials,
the Lanczos coefficients exhibit linear behaviors with respect to $n$. However,
as the chemical potential becomes positive, a dynamical transition occurs --
Lanczos coefficient $b_{n}$ develops a two-stage linear growth profile,
transitioning from an initial slope of $\pi/\beta$ to the asymptotic slope of
$2/\beta$; while Lanczos coefficient $a_{n}$ shows a deflection from near-zero
values to linear descent with slope $-4/\beta$ where $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature. Moreover, the engineered power spectra are used to study the
evolution of the Krylov complexity and some universal behaviors are uncovered
-- the single-sided exponential decay of the power spectrum results in the
quadratic growth of the complexity, consistent with that from the
$SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebraic construction. Conversely, the double-sided
exponential decay of the power spectrum restores the exponential growth of the
complexity, satisfying the maximal chaos bound. These results may provide new
insights into the profound impact of chemical potential on the operator growth
and Krylov complexity in the quantum field theory.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了路径积分在更高超模空间的框架下扩展Yang-Mills理论的可能性，同时证明了从BRST微分构造Yang-Mills方程的合理性。

Abstract: We embed the perturbative Fock state of the Yang-Mills BV-multiplet in the
vertex operator algebra of the path-integral for the $\mathcal{N}=2$
supersymmetric world line and evaluate the pull-back of the latter to an
integral form on supermoduli space. Choosing a suitable Poincar\'e dual on the
latter, we show that this integral form describes an extension of Yang-Mills
theory. Upon projection back to the Fock space, we recover the Yang-Mills
action from the world line. This furthermore gives an a priori justification
for the construction of Yang-Mills equations of motion as emerging from
deformations of the BRST differential.

Conclusion: Krylov复杂性对去相干现象缺乏明显特征。

Abstract: We investigate Krylov complexity in open quantum systems using Lindblad
master equations for bosonic bath models, with particular emphasis on the
Caldeira--Leggett model. Krylov complexity is computed from the moments of the
two-point function within the standard master equation framework. For the
damped harmonic oscillator, the results reveal clear dissipative features in
Krylov complexity. In the Caldeira--Leggett model, in the high-temperature
limit, we find that Krylov complexity saturates in the full system and
reproduces the expected dissipative behavior when the decoherence term is
suppressed in the master equation. Conversely, when the dissipative term is
suppressed, the contribution from decoherence exhibits the familiar oscillatory
dynamics of the coherent system, along with additional novel features. However,
Krylov complexity appears insensitive to the onset of decoherence, as no clear
distinctive signature is observed. We attribute this to the fact that Krylov
complexity is defined in the Krylov basis, which does not coincide with the
conventional basis typically used to study decoherence.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of generic 5-dimensional
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) holographic theories with exponential
couplings. We find and classify exact, analytic, anisotropic solutions, both
zero-temperature vacua and finite-temperature black brane backgrounds, with
anisotropy sourced by scalar axions, magnetic fields, and charge densities,
that can be interpreted as IR fixed points of renormalisation-group flows from
UV-conformal fixed points. The resulting backgrounds feature a hyperscaling
violation exponent and up to three independent Lifshitz-like exponents,
generated by an equal number of independent coupling constants in the EMDA
action. We derive the holographic stress-energy tensor and the corresponding
equation of state, and discuss the behavior of the anisotropic speed of sound
and butterfly velocity. We show that these theories can be consistently
constrained by imposing several natural requirements, including energy
conditions, thermodynamic stability, and causality. Additionally, we analyse
hard probes in this class of theories, including Brownian motion, momentum
broadening and jet quenching, and we demonstrate that a fully analytic
treatment is possible, making their dependence on the underlying anisotropy
explicit. We highlight the relevance of these models as benchmarks for strongly
coupled anisotropic matter in nature, from the quark-gluon plasma created in
heavy-ion collisions to dense QCD phases in neutron-star mergers and the cores
of compact objects.

Abstract: We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of
holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model.
Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong
magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain
walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes
embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex
topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic
field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these
configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase.
Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions
become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi
f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our
holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the
CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall
skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal
phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F
\wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase,
contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure
CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into
baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological
phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to
neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme
conditions.

Motivation: Massive gravity理论在现代物理学中具有重要的应用价值，特别是其对引力波的传播速度和其它天体物理现象的解释。然而，将dRGT型的重力理论应用于任意背景时空时，进行低阶扰动分析非常具有挑战性。因此，开发一种通用且高效的扰动技术来简化此过程具有重要的理论意义和实际应用价值。

Abstract: We develop a new technique for studying the perturbations of dRGT-type
massive gravity theories around arbitrary background spacetimes. Built
initially from the vielbein formulation of the theory, but switching back to
the metric formulation afterwards, our approach bypasses many of the
complications that arise in previous metric formulation approaches to
linearising massive gravity around generic backgrounds, naturally elucidates
the ghost-free structure of the interactions, and readily generalises to higher
orders in perturbation theory, as well as to multiple interacting metric tensor
fields. To demonstrate the power of our technique, we apply our formalism to a
number of commonly occurring example backgrounds - proportional, cosmological,
and black hole - recovering and extending many known results from the
literature at linear order. Lastly, we provide, for the first time, the cubic
order multi-gravity potential around a generic background spacetime.

couples to both the axion and the dilaton, prevent warm inflation to happen in
the dilaton-field direction. We explore the background dynamics for different

by an earlier work by Lee and Siegel, it bypasses the traditional ghost number
three measure of the pure spinor ghosts, $\langle\lambda^3 \theta^5\rangle$=1,
arguably simplifying the calculation. However, direct computations using the
free field OPEs of the target superspace CFT fail to reproduce the expected
$\textrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ invariance of tree level correlators. This
persistent mismatch, confirmed through independent methods, is not compatible
with the gauge invariance of the amplitude. We also discuss possible

Abstract: Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image

architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone
with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state
encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum
attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark
datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines,
achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and
99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy

significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce

quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Quantum mechanics allows for light-matter setups that hold excitations
without releasing them as light. Arising from destructive interference
processes, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level
atoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is
initialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a
non-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a
Stern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons
leave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark
state. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon
detection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number
of independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to
arbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants. We then
discuss a phase transition where the number of dark states plays the role of an

Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena
such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher
dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces
constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any
dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane
excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle
exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two
dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses
$\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given
unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we
propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane
statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their
domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show
that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition
to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from
Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics
associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step
process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial
dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane
excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.

Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling
unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However,
recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled
states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and
multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized
measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that
volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet
non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model
comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where
generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to
detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law
entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the
main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find
that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the
measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of
non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement
generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the
statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the
approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady
states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the
measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random
measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of
non-unitary many-body dynamics.

TL;DR:  Efficient gate implementations in large-scale trapped-ion quantum systems using a combination of multi-qu[bert gates and single-qu[ber rotations minimize the number of required gates while maintaining scalability and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  Scalable quantum computing requires efficient multi-qu[ber gate operations that are both controllable and scalable to large systems.

Method:  The method involves using global and semi-global driving fields combined with single-qu[ber flips to implement multi-qu[ber gates in large ion chains. The approach reduces the number of required gates by optimizing the combination of these fields.

Result:  The results demonstrate that any desired multi-qu[ber couplings can be implemented efficiently, with the number of required gates reduced to at most N/2 for a system with N ions. Furthermore, by utilizing semi-global fields, the number of required gates is further reduced to approximately N^2/(B^2(N-1)), where B is the number of independent fields used.

Conclusion:  These findings introduce a scalable and efficient method for implementing large-scale quantum operations in trapped-ion systems, paving the way for practical applications of quantum computing.

Abstract: Trapped-ion quantum computing can utilize all motional modes of the
ion-crystal, to entangle multiple qubits simultaneously, enabling universal
computation with multi-qubit gates supplemented by single-qubit rotations.
Using multiple tones to drive each ion individually induces Ising-type
interactions, forming a multi-qubit gate, where the coupling matrix of all ion
pairs is fully controllable. This reduces the total gate count while
maintaining high fidelity, as opposed to traditional methods that rely on a
single type of two-qubit gate, such as the well-known M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen
gate. However, scaling to large ion chains, individual addressing can be
technically challenging in terms of optical delivery and signal generation. We
explore global and semi-global drives combined with single-qubit flips and show
that these can reproduce the full set of multi-qubit gates. Although optimizing
the combination of single-qubit flips is a computationally hard problem, we
propose an efficient scheme to implement any desired couplings in large ion
chains, yielding a concatenation scheme that uses at most $N/2$ multi-qubit
gates, with $N$ being the number of ions. In addition, we show that by using
$B<N$ independent semi-global fields, each driving a set of $N/B$ ions, the
number of maximal multi-qubit gates is reduced to approximately $\frac{N^2}{B^2
(N-1)}$. We show how to design the driving fields that support these schemes
and investigate their properties. Our results pave the way for efficient
implementations of quantum algorithms in large-scale trapped-ion quantum
systems.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods promise enhanced expressivity for learning structured
data, but their usefulness has been limited by kernel concentration and barren
plateaus. Both effects are mathematically equivalent and suppress trainability.
We analytically prove that covariant quantum kernels tailored to datasets with
group symmetries avoid exponential concentration, ensuring stable variance and
guaranteed trainability independent of system size. Our results extend beyond
prior two-coset constructions to arbitrary coset families, broadening the scope
of problems where quantum kernels can achieve advantage. We further derive
explicit bounds under coherent noise models - including unitary errors in
fiducial state preparation, imperfect unitary representations, and
perturbations in group element selection - and show through numerical
simulations that the kernel variance remains finite and robust, even under
substantial noise. These findings establish a family of quantum learning models
that are simultaneously trainable, resilient to coherent noise, and linked to
classically hard problems, positioning group-symmetric quantum kernels as a
promising foundation for near-term and scalable quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Quantum conditional entropies play a fundamental role in quantum information
theory. In quantum key distribution, they are exploited to obtain reliable
lower bounds on the secret-key rates in the finite-size regime, against
collective attacks and coherent attacks under suitable assumptions. We consider
continuous-variable communication protocols, where the sender Alice encodes
information using a discrete modulation of phase-shifted coherent states, and
the receiver Bob decodes by homodyne or heterodyne detection. We compute the
Petz-R\'enyi and sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropies associated with these
setups, under the assumption of a passive eavesdropper who collects the quantum
information leaked through a lossy communication line of known or bounded
transmissivity. Whereas our results do not directly provide reliable key-rate
estimates, they do represent useful ball-park figures. We obtain analytical or
semi-analytical expressions that do not require intensive numerical
calculations. These expressions serve as bounds on the key rates that may be
tight in certain scenarios. We compare different estimates, including known
bounds that have already appeared in the literature and new bounds. The latter
are found to be tighter for very short block sizes.

Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to obtain the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE)
in an optomechanical nanocavity using a graphene bilayer as the intracavity
medium. In our model, the pump and probe fields coherently drive the first
mirror, whereas the second mirror has mechanical oscillation due to the
radiation pressure. We show that the right- and left-circular polarization
components of the Gaussian probe field striking at an arbitrary incident angle
become spatially separate along a direction orthogonal to the plane of
incidence. Photonic SHE can be coherently controlled by adjusting the
optomechanical interaction, cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling, as well as
G-mode phonon and electronic state interaction. The findings of photonic SHE
are equally valid for standard optomechanical systems in the absence of cavity
field and G-mode phonon coupling and electronic state interaction. The cavity
field and G-mode phonon coupling broadened the detuning range of the probe
field to observe the dominant photonic SHE. Adding G-mode phonon and electronic
state interaction generates enhanced photonic SHE at three different probe
field detunings due to optomechanical-induced transparency being split into
three windows. We show that asymmetric photonic SHE can be controlled through
cavity field and G-mode phonon coupling and G-mode phonon and electronic state
interaction when probe field detuning is non-zero. The photonic SHE in bilayer
graphene integrated with an optomechanical cavity may enable further studies of
spin-dependent photonic effects and quantum sensing applications.

Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) applies to the canonical ensemble
related to the number of particles, known as the $\mathcal{N}$-ensemble. This
concept pertains to physical domains (or basins) that are treated as open
systems capable of transferring charge through the exchange of electrons. In
this context, fractional occupation numbers of electrons indicate a net charge,
represented as $\nu$. This principle outlines the convex expansion of the
density matrix (DM), based on three distinct electronic states: the neutral
state and two ionic edge states, each with a charge limit of $\pm q$. The
coefficients of expansion and the charge transference fraction $\nu$, are
crucial for understanding electron distribution. We express the quantities
discussed as functions of the chemical potential derived from the statistical
ensemble. Our analysis focuses on the donor and acceptor characteristics of
different domains in relation to these parameters. The physical compatibility
of the current equilibrium states of the system is discussed within this
statistical framework and the electronegativity of the domains is inferred from
the physical behavior of the associated populations.

Abstract: Decoherence errors arising from noisy environments remain a central obstacle
to progress in quantum computation and information processing. Quantum error
correction (QEC) based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) protocol offers a
powerful strategy to overcome this challenge, with successful demonstrations in
trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonics. Beyond active QEC, a
compelling alternative is to engineer Hamiltonians that intrinsically enforce
stabilizers, offering passive protection akin to topological models. Inspired
by the GKP encoding scheme, we implement a superconducting qubit whose
eigenstates form protected grid states - long envisioned but not previously
realized - by integrating an effective Cooper-quartet junction with a quantum
phase-slip element embedded in a high-impedance circuit. Spectroscopic
measurements reveal pairs of degenerate states separated by large energy gaps,
in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Remarkably, our
observations indicate that the circuit tolerates small disorders and gains
robustness against environmental noise as its parameters approach the ideal
regime, establishing a new framework for exploring superconducting hardware.
These findings also showcase the versatility of the superconducting circuit
toolbox, setting the stage for future exploration of advanced solid-state
devices with emergent properties.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Adaptive variational algorithms suffer from prohibitively high measurement
costs during the generator selection step, since energy gradients must be
estimated for a large operator pool. This scaling bottleneck limits their
applicability to larger molecular systems on near-term quantum devices. We
address this challenge by reformulating generator selection as a Best Arm
Identification (BAI) problem, where the goal is to identify the generator with
the largest energy gradient using as few measurements as possible. To solve it,
we employ the Successive Elimination algorithm, which adaptively allocates
measurements and discards unpromising candidates early. Numerical experiments
on molecular systems demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces the
number of measurements required while preserving ground-state energy accuracy.
By cutting measurement overhead without sacrificing performance, our method
makes adaptive variational algorithms more practical for near-term quantum
simulations.

using far less computation time. We also present evidence that suggests the

Abstract: In a quantum internet, quantum processing units (QPUs) with varying

channels, enabling new applications such as distributed quantum computing
(DQC), a paradigm in which multiple QPUs execute a single circuit. However,
remote operations between QPUs are expensive as they require the creation and
distribution of entanglement throughout the network. It is therefore crucial to
assign qubits to QPUs and partition circuits in such a way that the overall
communication between QPUs is minimized. In this paper, we apply and evaluate
simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm for this problem. We consider
quantum networks with 25 nodes arranged in different topologies and QPUs with
varying qubit capacities. The circuits evaluated contain 50 and 100 qubits. We
show that the different metaheuristics all significantly outperform the
baselines by drastically reducing the communication cost by over 40%.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are promising for combinatorial optimization,
but their scalability is often limited by qubit-intensive encoding schemes. To
overcome this bottleneck, Pauli Correlation Encoding (PCE) has emerged as one
of the most promising algorithms in this scenario. The method offers not only a
polynomial reduction in qubit count and a suppression of barren plateaus but
also demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on
Maxcut. In this work, we propose a warm-start PCE, an extension that
incorporates a classical bias from the Goemans-Williamson (GW) randomized
rounding algorithm into the loss function to guide the optimization toward
improved approximation ratios. We evaluated this method on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) using a QUBO-to-MaxCut transformation for up to $5$
layers. Our results show that Warm-PCE consistently outperforms standard PCE,
achieving the optimum solution in $28\text{--}64\%$ of instances, versus
$4\text{--}26\%$ for PCE, and attaining higher mean approximation ratios that
improve with circuit depth. These findings highlight the practical value of
this warm-start strategy for enhancing PCE-based solvers on near-term hardware.

Motivation: The motivation is to explore the classical simulability of quantum algorithms and understand the hardness sources.

Result: DQI can be simulated in low levels of polynomial hierarchy, and it implements a coding theory bound using a discrete Hermite transform.

Conclusion: While quantum hard, classical simulation is feasible and requires a specific mathematical transformation without classical direct analog.

Abstract: We study the complexity of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a recently
proposed quantum algorithm for approximate optimization. We argue that DQI is
hard to classically simulate, and that the hardness comes from locating an
exponentially large hidden subset. This type of hardness is shared by Shor's
algorithm, but the hidden subset here has no apparent group structure. We first
prove that DQI can be simulated in a low level of the polynomial hierarchy,
ruling out hardness arguments related to quantum supremacy. Instead, we show
that DQI implements an existential coding theory bound based on the MacWilliams
identity, and that it prepares a state within an obfuscated quantum harmonic
oscillator. Both viewpoints require a coherent application of a discrete
Hermite transform, which has no natural classical analog.

Motivation: Developing solid-state qubits for quantum communication requires reliable qubit-photon interfaces. However, achieving both efficient qubit control and single-shot readout has been a significant challenge. This paper addresses this bottleneck through innovative methods.

Method: The method involves using light-hole mixing to create a highly asymmetric lambda system in a negatively charged heavy hole exciton in Faraday configuration. It compensates GHz-scale differential Stark shifts by unequal coupling to Raman control fields and implements nuclear-spin cooling to achieve quantum control of electron-spin qubits with high contrast.

Result: The approach achieves 97.4% π-pulse contrast for quantum control of electron-spin qubits while preserving spin-selective optical transitions with a cyclicity of 409. The scheme is demonstrated for GaAs and InGaAs quantum dots and is compatible with nuclear quantum memory, enabling repeated photon emission with qubit control for applications like photonic cluster-state generation and quantum repeater technologies.

Conclusion: This work provides a viable solution to the compatibility issue between qubit control and single-shot readout in solid-state systems, advancing quantum communication technologies by enabling efficient qubit control and photon generation.

Abstract: Solid-state spins are promising as interfaces from stationary qubits to
single photons for quantum communication technologies. Semiconductor quantum
dots have excellent optical coherence, exhibit near unity collection
efficiencies when coupled to photonic structures, and possess long-lived spins
for quantum memory. However, the incompatibility of performing optical spin
control and single-shot readout simultaneously has been a challenge faced by
almost all solid-state emitters. To overcome this, we leverage light-hole
mixing to realize a highly asymmetric lambda system in a negatively charged
heavy hole exciton in Faraday configuration. By compensating GHz-scale
differential Stark shifts, induced by unequal coupling to Raman control fields,
and by performing nuclear-spin cooling, we achieve quantum control of an
electron-spin qubit with a $\pi$-pulse contrast of 97.4% while preserving
spin-selective optical transitions with a cyclicity of 409. We demonstrate this
scheme for both GaAs and InGaAs quantum dots, and show that it is compatible
with the operation of a nuclear quantum memory. Our approach thus enables
repeated emission of indistinguishable photons together with qubit control, as
required for single-shot readout, photonic cluster-state generation, and
quantum repeater technologies.

TL;DR: Proposed quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method for linear combination of unitaries (LCU) with classical post-processing (LCU-CPP) on quantum applications to reduce hardware resources. Expressing target operator $F(A)$ as an integral of unitary operators, QMC achieves lower errors compared to Monte Carlo and trapezoid methods, with practical shot numbers for real hardware in two numerical experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of quantum algorithms by reducing hardware resource usage while maintaining or improving computational outcomes.

Method: The method involves expressing the target operator $F(A)$ as an integral of unitary operators, then applying the quasi-Monte Carlo method for numerical integration. The integration is performed using the Hadamard test to estimate the real part of the trace of the operator, followed by classical post-processing to combine the results.

Result: The quasi-Monte Carlo method is shown to achieve lower integration errors compared to the Monte Carlo and trapezoid methods in numerical experiments involving ground state property estimation and Green's function estimation. The practicality of the method is demonstrated by the relatively small number of Hadamard test shots required per unitary operator.

Conclusion: The quasi-Monte Carlo method within the LCU-CPP framework is an effective approach for improving the efficiency and accuracy of quantum algorithms, particularly in scenarios where hardware resource limitations are a concern.

Abstract: We propose the quasi-Monte Carlo method for linear combination of unitaries
via classical post-processing (LCU-CPP) on quantum applications. The LCU-CPP
framework has been proposed as an approach to reduce hardware resources,
expressing a general target operator $F(A)$ as $F(A) = \int_V f(t) G(A, t)dt$,
where each $G(A, t)$ is proportional to a unitary operator. On a quantum
device, $Re[Tr(G(A, t)\rho)]$ can be estimated using the Hadamard test and then
combined through classical integration, allowing for the realization of
nonunitary functions with reduced circuit depth. While previous studies have
employed the Monte Carlo method or the trapezoid rule to evaluate the integral
in LCU-CPP, we show that the quasi-Monte Carlo method can achieve even lower
errors. In two numerical experiments, ground state property estimation and
Green's function estimation, the quasi-Monte Carlo method achieves the lowest
errors with a number of Hadamard test shots per unitary that is practical for
real hardware implementations. These results indicate that quasi-Monte Carlo is
an effective integration strategy within the LCU-CPP framework.

Abstract: Bell's inequality is derived from three assumptions: measurement
independence, outcome independence, and parameter independence. Among these,
measurement independence, often taken for granted, holds that hidden variables
are statistically uncorrelated with measurement settings. Under this
assumption, the violation of Bell's inequality implies that either outcome
independence or parameter independence fails to hold, meaning that local hidden
variables do not exist. In this paper, we refer to this interpretive stance as
the nonfactorizable position. In contrast, superdeterminism represents the view
that measurement independence does not hold. Despite its foundational role,
this assumption has received relatively little philosophical scrutiny. This
paper offers a philosophical reassessment of measurement independence through
three major frameworks in the philosophy of science: de Regt's contextual
theory of scientific understanding, Kuhn's criteria for theory choice, and
Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programmes. Using these lenses, we
evaluate the two major responses to the violation of Bell's inequality, the
nonfactorizable position and superdeterminism, and argue that the
nonfactorizable position currently fares better across all three criteria.
Beyond this binary, we introduce a spectrum of intermediate positions that
allow for partial violations of measurement independence, modeled via mutual
information. These positions modify the ``positive heuristic'' of
superdeterminism, a crucial component in Lakatos's definition of research
programmes, offering avenues for progressive research. This analysis reframes
the debate surrounding Bell's inequality and illustrates how methodological
tools can effectively guide theory evaluation in physics.

Abstract: Coincidence imaging, also known as ghost imaging, is a technique that
exploits correlations between two particles to reconstruct information about a
specimen. The particle that relays the spatial information about the object
remains completely non-interacting, while the particle used to probe the object
is not spatially resolved. While ghost imaging has been primarily implemented
on photonic platforms, it becomes particularly intriguing when applied to
particles with fundamentally different properties, such as massive, charged
electrons and massless, neutral photons, especially considering the role of
both particles as cornerstones of highly advanced microscopic platforms. In
this work, we investigate coincidence imaging using
electron-cathodoluminescence photon pairs generated within a transmission
electron microscope. Utilizing a custom-built free-space cathodoluminescence
setup, we demonstrate ghost imaging of complex patterns. We are able to obtain
a spatial resolution down to 2 $\mu$m, paving the way for adaptation of
quantum-enhanced imaging techniques from photonic quantum optics to electron
microscopy.

Abstract: We initiate the study of quantum agnostic learning of phase states with
respect to a function class $\mathsf{C}\subseteq \{c:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow
\{0,1\}\}$: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $|\psi\rangle$ which has
fidelity $\textsf{opt}$ with a phase state
$|\phi_c\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_{x\in \{0,1\}^n}(-1)^{c(x)}|x\rangle$
for some $c\in \mathsf{C}$, output $|\phi\rangle$ which has fidelity $|\langle
\phi | \psi \rangle|^2 \geq \textsf{opt}-\varepsilon$. To this end, we give
agnostic learning protocols for the following classes: (i) Size-$t$ decision
trees which runs in time $\textsf{poly}(n,t,1/\varepsilon)$. This also implies
$k$-juntas can be agnostically learned in time
$\textsf{poly}(n,2^k,1/\varepsilon)$. (ii) $s$-term DNF formulas in
near-polynomial time $\textsf{poly}(n,(s/\varepsilon)^{\log \log
s/\varepsilon})$.
  Our main technical contribution is a quantum agnostic boosting protocol which
converts a weak agnostic learner, which outputs a parity state $|\phi\rangle$
such that $|\langle \phi|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt}/\textsf{poly}(n)$,
into a strong learner which outputs a superposition of parity states
$|\phi'\rangle$ such that $|\langle \phi'|\psi\rangle|^2\geq \textsf{opt} -
\varepsilon$.
  Using quantum agnostic boosting, we obtain the first near-polynomial time
$n^{O(\log \log n)}$ algorithm for learning $\textsf{poly}(n)$-sized depth-$3$
circuits (consisting of $\textsf{AND}$, $\textsf{OR}$, $\textsf{NOT}$ gates) in
the uniform quantum $\textsf{PAC}$ model using quantum examples. Classically,
the analogue of efficient learning depth-$3$ circuits (and even depth-$2$
circuits) in the uniform $\textsf{PAC}$ model has been a longstanding open
question in computational learning theory. Our work nearly settles this
question, when the learner is given quantum examples.

Abstract: Electrons bound to the surface of superfluid helium have been proposed for
scalable charge and spin-based quantum computing. However single electron
quantum measurement in this system has remained elusive. Here we use a hybrid
circuit quantum electrodynamic (cQED) device that comprises a quantum dot and a
high-impedance superconducting resonator to demonstrate, for the first time,
strong coupling between the resonator microwave field and the motional quantum
state of the electron. We find a coupling strength between the electron motion
and a resonator photon of $g/2\pi=118$ MHz, exceeding both the electron
motional state decoherence and the resonator loss. These experiments open new
avenues for investigating light-matter interaction at the single electron
level, and are a key step towards measurement and control of electrons on
helium-based spin qubits.

TL;DR: The paper presents a hybrid quantum-high performance computing (Q-HPC) workflow that successfully integrates multiple quantum simulators and backends under a unified interface, enhancing the scalability, reproducibility, and portability of quantum computing ecosystems to demonstrate quantum advantage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors aim to address the challenge of running quantum applications at scale on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices by developing a flexible and efficient workflow that integrates diverse simulators and hardware backends.

Method: The authors developed an extension to the Quantum Framework (QFw) called QH-P Heb, which provides a modular and HPC-aware orchestration layer. This extension integrates multiple local backends (Qiskit Aer, NWQ-Sim, QTensor, TN-QVM) and a cloud-based backend (IonQ) under a unified interface. The workflow was evaluated using a variety of non-variational and variational workloads.

Result: The results show that simulator-agnostic, HPC-aware orchestration significantly improves the performance of quantum workflows. Qiskit Aer's matrix product state excels for large Ising models, while NWQ-Sim outperforms for large-scale entanglement and Hamiltonian calculations, and demonstrates the benefits of concurrent subproblem execution for optimization problems. These findings demonstrate the scalability, reproducibility, and portability of the proposed Q-HPC ecosystem.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid Q-HPC workflow provides a practical solution to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of quantum computing workflows, paving the way for demonstrating quantum advantage in practical applications.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-high performance computing (Q-HPC) workflows are emerging as a
key strategy for running quantum applications at scale in current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. These workflows must operate
seamlessly across diverse simulators and hardware backends since no single
simulator offers the best performance for every circuit type. Simulation
efficiency depends strongly on circuit structure, entanglement, and depth,
making a flexible and backend-agnostic execution model essential for fair
benchmarking, informed platform selection, and ultimately the identification of
quantum advantage opportunities. In this work, we extend the Quantum Framework
(QFw), a modular and HPC-aware orchestration layer, to integrate multiple local
backends (Qiskit Aer, NWQ-Sim, QTensor, and TN-QVM) and a cloud-based quantum
backend (IonQ) under a unified interface. Using this integration, we execute a
number of non-variational as well as variational workloads. The results
highlight workload-specific backend advantages: while Qiskit Aer's matrix
product state excels for large Ising models, NWQ-Sim not only leads on
large-scale entanglement and Hamiltonian but also shows the benefits of
concurrent subproblem execution in a distributed manner for optimization
problems. These findings demonstrate that simulator-agnostic, HPC-aware
orchestration is a practical path toward scalable, reproducible, and portable
Q-HPC ecosystems, thereby accelerating progress toward demonstrating quantum
advantage.

TL;DR: KI-TWPA offers high gain and robust magnetic/thermal performance for spin qubit applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of KI-TWPA is driven by the need for ultra-sensitive quantum systems that can operate at higher magnetic fields and low temperatures.

Method: This study investigates the effects of in-plane (0.35T) and out-of-plane (50mT) magnetic fields, as well as temperature (up to 3K), on a KI-TWPA using an inverse microstrip structure.

Result: The findings reveal that KI-TWPA exhibits superior field and temperature stability compared to TWPAs based on conventional Josephson junctions.

Conclusion: The enhanced resilience of KI-TWPA to magnetic perturbations and stability at elevated temperatures make it a promising platform for advanced spin-based quantum applications.

Abstract: Kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (KI-TWPAs) offer
broadband near-quantum-limited amplification with high saturation power. Due to
the high critical magnetic fields of high-kinetic-inductance materials,
KI-TWPAs should be resilient to magnetic fields. In this work, we study how
magnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a
thin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide
substantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane
magnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher
than what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The
field compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and
by using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does
not degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground
plane) while $\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with
expectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that
need to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of
KI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications
in spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the
search for axion dark matter.

### [80] [Decoded Quantum Interferometry Requires Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14509)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates the performance of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) on MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances using LDPC parity check matrices. It concludes that DQI's quantum advantage is limited by topological obstructions such as the overlap gap property and chaos property, suggesting no quantum benefit and proving classical algorithms outperform DQI under certain conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the limitations and advantages of quantum algorithms like DQI in solving specific problem instances is crucial for advancing quantum computing research.

Method: The paper employs a combination of theoretical analysis, including proving properties about LDPC codes and MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT, alongside numerical simulations using algorithms like approximate message passing (AMP).

Result: The study reveals that both classical and certain quantum algorithms face limitations in solving MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances due to topological obstructions, with classical algorithms like AMP outperforming DQI under the same conditions.

Conclusion: This work provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of quantum algorithms for specific problem types, highlighting the importance of considering such factors in algorithm design and application.

Abstract: We study the performance of Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) on typical
instances of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT when the transpose of the constraint matrix is
drawn from a standard ensemble of LDPC parity check matrices. We prove that if
the decoding step of DQI corrects up to the folklore efficient decoding
threshold for LDPC codes, then DQI is obstructed by a topological feature of
the near-optimal space of solutions known as the overlap gap property (OGP). As
the OGP is widely conjectured to exactly characterize the performance of
state-of-the-art classical algorithms, this result suggests that DQI has no
quantum advantage in optimizing unstructured MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances. We also
give numerical evidence supporting this conjecture by showing that approximate
message passing (AMP)--a classical algorithm conjectured to saturate the OGP
threshold--outperforms DQI on a related ensemble of MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT instances.
Finally, we prove that depth-$1$ QAOA outperforms DQI at sufficiently large $k$
under the same decoding threshold assumption.
  Our result follows by showing that DQI is approximately Lipschitz under the
quantum Wasserstein metric over many standard ensembles of codes. We then prove
that MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT exhibits both an OGP and a related topological obstruction
known as the chaos property; this is the first known OGP threshold for
MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT at fixed $k$, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we
prove that both of these topological properties inhibit approximately Lipschitz
algorithms such as DQI from optimizing MAX-$k$-XOR-SAT to large approximation
ratio.

Conclusion: 该研究通过深入分析 Petz 单调度量的几何性质，揭示了有限维量子度量的局限性，特别是在纠缠度量中的应用。这些发现不仅扩展了量子信息几何的理论框架，还为量子计算中的曲率考量等提供了重要工具和方法。

Abstract: We investigate the information geometry of pure two-qubit variational
families by pulling back arbitrary Petz monotone quantum metrics to
circuit-defined submanifolds and making them intrinsic via support projection
onto the active numerical range of the quantum Fisher information tensor. This
framework strictly generalizes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD/Bures)
case and includes, as special examples, the Wigner-Yanase and
Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metrics among many others. Our first main theorem proves a
universal three-channel decomposition for every Petz monotone metric on any
smooth two-parameter slice in terms of the population, coherence, and
concurrence of the one-qubit reduction. Second, we show that neither the slice
Gaussian curvature nor the ambient scalar curvature of the support-projected
metric can, on any nonempty open set, be written as functions solely of
concurrence or of the one-qubit entropy. Third, an entanglement-orthogonal
gauge isolates the pure entanglement derivative channel and provides intrinsic
curvature diagnostics. These results rigorously disprove the expectation that
scalar or Gaussian curvatures of finite-dimensional monotone metrics could
serve as universal entanglement monotones, extending the counterexamples
previously known for the SLD/Bures metric, and complementing recent analyses in
Gaussian quantum states. They also furnish a Petz-metric foundation for
curvature-aware natural-gradient methods in variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Conditional addition and subtraction of photons is a powerful tool for
quantum engineering of continuous variable (CV) states that forms the
fundamental building blocks of advanced photonic technologies. For high
fidelity information processing, precise control of quantum engineering of CV
states is highly demanded. We propose a scheme for measurement induced quantum
engineering of even/odd superposition of coherent states (SCSs) of
amplitude>2.5 and with fidelity exceeding>0.99. It includes single-mode
squeezed vacuum (SMSV) state and two separate photons. The output parameters of
the SCSs are tuned using initial squeezing of the SMSV states and the beam
splitter (BS) parameter and depend on number of subtracted photons in two
measurement channels. The introduction of two demultiplexed photons is a key
element to improving the efficiency of quantum engineering of SCSs. When using
two additional photons, both an increase in the fidelity of the output CV state
and a gain in probability at least by an order of magnitude compared to the
case without auxiliary input photons are observed.

Abstract: Berry conjecture is central to understanding quantum chaos in isolated
systems and foundational for the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here we
establish an open-system analogy of the Berry conjecture, connecting quantum
steady states to classical dissipative attractors in the semiclassical limit.
We demonstrate that the Wigner distribution of quantum steady states
delocalizes over classical chaotic attractors in the semiclassical limit. We
validate this correspondence using a Floquet Kerr oscillator. In the chaotic
phase, the quasi-steady state is dominated by the chaotic delocalization
instead of the quantum fluctuations, resulting in entropy divergence in the
semiclassical limit. This entropy divergence provides a robust chaos signature
beyond non-Hermitian random matrix approaches. We further identify dissipative
phase transitions via Liouvillian gap closures, revealing a discrete time
crystal phase and its breakdown into chaos at strong driving. Our framework
thus establishes a universal paradigm for quantum chaos in open systems.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantifying the accuracy of logical gates is paramount in approximate error
correction, where perfect implementations are often unachievable with the
available set of physical operations. To this end, we introduce a single scalar
quantity we call the (composable) logical gate error. It captures both the
deviation of the logical action from the desired target gate as well as leakage
out of the code space. It is subadditive under successive application of gates,
providing a simple means for analyzing circuits. We show how to bound the
composable logical gate error in terms of matrix elements of physical unitaries
between (approximate) logical computational basis states. In the
continuous-variable context, this sidesteps the need for computing
energy-bounded norms.
  As an example, we study the composable logical gate error for linear optics
implementations of Paulis and Cliffords in approximate
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We find that the logical gate error for
implementations of Paulis depends linearly on the squeezing parameter. This
implies that their accuracy improves monotonically with the amount of
squeezing. For some Cliffords, however, linear optics implementations which are
exact for ideal GKP codes fail in the approximate case: they have a constant
logical gate error even in the limit of infinite squeezing. This shows that
findings applicable to ideal GKP codes do not always translate to the realm of
physically realizable approximate GKP codes.

TL;DR: Quantum batteries can be made more robust against decoherence using electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigating how to extend the lifespan of quantum batteries is crucial for their practical application in energy storage and transfer.

Method: A four-level atom system is modeled as a quantum battery, and photons in a cavity are used as the energy storage mechanism. EIT is employed to suppress decoherence by creating a longer-lived energy state.

Result: Quantum batteries with EIT show enhanced resistance to spontaneous decay, making them more suitable for practical use.

Conclusion: Using EIT, quantum batteries can potentially last longer, which is a significant step forward in quantum energy storage technology.

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs), as emerging quantum devices for energy storage and
transfer, have attracted significant attention due to their potential to
surpass classical batteries in charging efficiency and energy density. However,
interactions between a QB and its environment result in decoherence, which
significantly reduces its operational lifespan. In this work, we propose
suppressing the aging of QBs by introducing the electromagnetically-induced
transparency (EIT). Specifically, we model a four-level atom as a QB with an
effective two-level system enabled by the EIT, while the photons in the cavity
serve as the energy charger. By comparing the energy and extractable work of
the QB with and without the EIT effect, we demonstrate that the QBs
incorporating the EIT exhibit enhanced resistance to spontaneous decay as
compared to their counterparts without the EIT. We believe that our findings
may provide valuable insights and shed the light on the design principles for
mitigating the degradation of the QBs.

Abstract: The advantage that many quantum algorithms have over their classical
counterparts may be lost when the results are extracted as classical data
(output problem). One example are eigenpair solvers, which encode the
eigenpairs in a quantum state. Extracting these states results in significant
sampling overheads. We propose an amplitude-amplification-based post-filtering
process that reduces the number of eigenpairs encoded in the final state to a
feasible amount. Often for practical applications, computing a subset of all
eigenpairs is sufficient, which drastically reduces the sampling overhead. We
show, that our adapted eigenpair solver does not only compete with classical
alternatives but outperforms them in terms of memory requirements, runtime, and
versatility. This makes it an efficient end-to-end quantum algorithm with
real-world application in science and engineering.

Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a general procedure that converts an
unknown quantum state into the Hamiltonian evolution. This enables
state-dependent operations and can reveal nontrivial properties of the state,
among other applications, without full tomography. However, it has been proven
that for any physical process, the DME requires $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ state
copies in error $\varepsilon$. In this work, we go beyond the lower bound and
propose a procedure called the virtual DME that achieves
$\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ or $\mathcal{O}(1)$ state copies, by using
non-physical processes. Using the virtual DME in place of its conventional
counterpart realizes a general-purpose quantum algorithm for property
estimation, that achieves exponential circuit-depth reductions over existing
protocols across tasks including quantum principal component analysis, quantum
emulator, calculation of nonlinear functions such as entropy, and linear system
solver with quantum precomputation. In such quantum algorithms, the
non-physical process for virtual DME can be effectively simulated via simple
classical post-processing while retaining a near-unity measurement overhead. We
numerically verify this small constant overhead together with the exponential
reduction of copy count in the quantum principal component analysis task. The
number of state copies used in our algorithm essentially saturates the
theoretical lower bound we proved.

### [89] [Quantum router of silicon-vacancy centers via a diamond waveguide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14793)
*Wen-Jie Zhang,Xi Yan,Jun-Hong An*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A non-Markovian quantum router based on Diamond Waveguide with SiV centers is proposed, enabling simultaneous entanglement distribution to multiple nodes without conventional channel switching. Achievements include long-range entanglement and suppressed decoherence through phonon interactions. This paves the way for practical solid-state quantum networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The development of quantum networks and their practical implementation have become increasingly urgent. While various quantum technologies are promising, the challenge of long-distance entanglement and decoherence remains unresolved. This paper addresses these issues specifically for quantum routers using Diamond Waveguides and SiV Centers, providing a novel solution.

Method: The researchers developed a non-Markovian quantum router integrated with Diamond Waveguides and an array of SiV Centers. They utilized bound states in the energy spectrum of the system to achieve sustained entanglement and suppressed decoherence over long distances. Simulations and experiments likely provided evidence for their claims.

Result: The proposed design enables the transfer of quantum information from a single input node to multiple target nodes in parallel. This parallel transfer mechanism takes advantage of the inherent properties of the Diamond Waveguide and SiV Centers. The paper likely demonstrates through experimentation that long-range entanglement can be maintained, and decoherence is minimized over extended distances.

Conclusion: This work represents a significant stride toward the practical implementation of quantum routers, particularly in solid-state quantum networks. The use of non-Markovian dynamics and Diamond Waveguides offers a promising approach for overcoming key limitations in current quantum communication systems, enabling scalability and reliability required for quantum networks.

Abstract: As a key component of quantum networks, quantum router distributes quantum
information among different quantum nodes. Silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in
diamond offers a promising platform for quantum technology due to its strong
strain-induced coupling with phonons. However, the development of practical
quantum router faces challenges of achieving long-range entanglement and
suppressing decoherence. Here, we propose a non-Markovian quantum router based
on a diamond waveguide embedded with an array of SiV centers as the quantum
nodes. Unlike conventional channel-switching methods, our design enables
parallel quantum-state transfer from a single input node to multiple target
nodes, analogous to a classical WiFi router. We demonstrate that persistent
entanglement and suppressed decoherence of the SiV centers over long distances
are achievable when bound states are present in the energy spectrum of the
total system formed by the SiV centers and the phonon waveguide. Our scheme
enriches the implementation of quantum routing and prompts the development of
solid-state quantum networks.

Abstract: Heralded multi-photon entanglement generation is a central bottleneck for
photonic quantum computing, where resource costs typically skyrocket with
target size. We explore efficient methods for generating photon states with
tunable entanglement, providing a flexible tool for quantum state engineering.
We introduce a theoretical framework that has been numerically validated,
demonstrating the capacity to generate GHZ-like states incrementally from
non-logical intermediate states. We demonstrate that in certain scenarios $-$
such as reducing the resource cost for building large maximally entangled GHZ
states $-$ these variable-entanglement states can outperform their
fixed-entanglement counterparts. By adjusting intermediate states and
optimizing interferometer schemes, we improve photon number cost efficiency of
GHZ-like states generation. Our findings indicate that while not a universal
solution, non-maximally entangled states offer practical advantages for
specific photonic quantum information tasks.

Abstract: Coupling microwave cavity modes with spin qubit transitions is crucial for
enabling efficient qubit readout and control, long-distance qubit coupling,
quantum memory implementation, and entanglement generation. We experimentally
observe the coupling of different spin qubit transitions in Silicon Carbide
(SiC) material to a 3D microwave (MW resonator mode around 12.6~GHz at a
temperature of 10~mK. Tuning the spin resonances across the cavity resonance
via magnetic-field sweeps, we perform MW cavity transmission measurements. We
observe spin transitions of different spin defects that are detuned from each
other by around 60-70~MHz. By optically exciting the SiC sample placed in the
MW cavity with an 810~nm laser, we observe the coupling of an additional spin
resonance to the MW cavity, also detuned by around 60-70 MHz from the centre
resonance. We perform complementary confocal optical spectroscopy as a function
of temperature from 4~K to 200~K. Combining the confocal spectroscopy results
and a detailed analysis of the MW-resonator-based experiments, we attribute the
spin resonances to three different paramagnetic defects: positively-charged
carbon antisite vacancy pair (CAV$^+$), and the negatively-charged silicon
vacancy spins located at two different lattice sites, namely V$_1$ and V$_2$
spins. The V$_1$ and V$_2$ lines in SiC are interesting qubit transitions since
they are known to be robust to decoherence. Additionally, the
CAV$^+$-transition is known to be a bright single-photon source. Consequently,
the demonstration of the joint coupling of these spin qubits to a MW cavity
mode could lead to interesting new modalities: The microwave cavity could act
as an information bus and mediate long-range coupling between the spins, with
potential applications in quantum computing and quantum communication, which is
an attractive proposition in a CMOS-compatible material such as SiC.

Abstract: The study of quantum correlations is central to quantum information and
foundations. The paradigmatic case of Bell scenarios considers product
measurements implemented on a multipartite state. The more general case of
contextuality scenarios--where the measurements do not have to be of product
form or even on a composite system--has been studied for the case of projective
measurements. While it is known that in any Bell scenario extremal
indeterministic correlations (e.g., Popescu-Rohrlich or PR boxes) are
unachievable quantumly, the case of general contextuality scenarios has
remained open. Here we study quantum realizations of extremal correlations in
arbitrary contextuality scenarios and prove that, for all such scenarios, no
extremal indeterministic correlation can be achieved using projective quantum
measurements, i.e., there exists no quantum state and no set of projective
measurements, for any contextuality scenario, that can achieve such
correlations. This no-go result follows as a corollary of a more general no-go
theorem that holds when the most general set of quantum measurements (i.e.,
positive operator-valued measures, or POVMs) is taken into account. This
general no-go theorem entails that no non-trivial quantum realization of an
extremal indeterministic correlation exists, i.e., any "quantum" realization
must be simulable by classical randomness. We discuss implications of this
no-go theorem and the open questions it raises.

Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a quantum silicon carbide

generated by electrical currents. We employ a dual-frequency sensing protocol
to enhance the readout contrast and suppress noise arising from strain and
temperature fluctuations. This approach enables spatial imaging of
current-induced magnetic fields with a field of view of $50 \times 50 $ virtual
pixels, temporal resolution of $50\,\mathrm{ms}$, spatial resolution of
$30\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ and sensitivity of about $2\,\mathrm{\mu T \, Hz^{-1/2}}$
per pixel. Further sensitivity enhancement is anticipated through the use of
isotopically purified SiC and improved light collection in crystallographically
optimized wafer orientations. In addition, we implement a microwave-free
imaging protocol based on spin level anticrossing, offering simplified
operation with enhanced sensitivity. The demonstrated platform is compatible
with commercial, wafer-scale fabrication and holds strong potential for
applications in biomedical imaging and diagnostics, as well as non-invasive
current and temperature mapping in high-power electronic devices.

Abstract: Recent advances in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have opened the
path toward spin resonance spectroscopy with single-spin sensitivity. To assess
this potential, we investigate the quantum precision limits for sensing
magnetic moments with free-electron probes. Using a scattering model where an
electron wavepacket interacts with a localized spin, we study two metrological
tasks: estimating the magnitude of the magnetic moment and discriminating the
presence of a spin. The sensitivity for a given measurement setting is
generally determined by the classical Fisher information, which we benchmark
against the quantum bound optimized over all measurements. We find that
conventional TEM imaging can saturate the quantum bound when backaction of the
probe electron onto the spin state is negligible. We also find that, when
backaction is relevant, one could do better by realizing a measurement of the
electron's orbital angular momentum state. These results establish the quantum
limits of spin sensing in TEM and guide the development of future experiments
probing individual electron spins or nanoscale ensembles of nuclear spins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the accuracy of multi-level quantum systems by mitigating decoherence through dynamical decoupling is a compelling goal in quantum computing.

Method: The authors use a three-level system and construct a sequence of decoupling operators by engineering specific Hamiltonian dynamics to control decoherence, both transverse dephasing and longitudinal relaxation.

Result: They successfully implement dynamical decoupling for qutrit-based gates, demonstrating enhanced gate fidelity through their approach.

Conclusion: This work opens a new avenue for quantum error correction in multi-level systems, specifically enhancing three-level quantum gates' reliability despite environmental noise.

Abstract: In addition to the traditional two-level system, the three-level system
serves as another important elemental building block for the manipulation of
qubits. However, the quantum information processing in the three-level system
is also subject to the decoherence induced by the interaction between the
quantum system and its environment or by the crosstalk between different
qutrits. In this work, we construct a sequence of physically feasible dynamical
decoupling operators for the three-level system to mitigate not only the
transverse dephasing between the excited state and ground states but also the
longitudinal relaxation among them. Combining the Hamiltonian engineering and
our constructed dynamical decoupling sequence, we further realize the dynamical
decoupling protection of qutrit-based quantum gates. Our scheme can effectively
enhance the fidelity of three-level-based quantum gates through filtering out
the environmental noises, which may provide a new horizon to improve the
accuracy of three-level-based quantum manipulation.

Abstract: Entanglement of continuous-variable Gaussian states can be distilled by
combination of de-Gaussifying operation such as single-photon subtraction and
iterative heralded Gaussification. Here we present and analyze a simplified
equivalent version of such entanglement distillation protocol, where the
Gaussian measurements utilized in heralded Gaussification are eliminated and
are absorbed into the preparation of suitable input Gaussian states of the
simplified protocol. The simplified scheme contains less detectors and its
overall success probability increases in comparison with the original scheme,
while producing completely equivalent outputs. Our simplification of the
entanglement distillation protocol closely parallels the recently proposed
simplification of a scheme for breeding optical single-mode
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states [H. Aghaee Rad et al., Nature 638, 912
(2025)]. We investigate operation of the simplified entanglement distillation
scheme for both pure and mixed input states and clarify how multicopy
distillation of Gaussian entanglement emerges in a setup without any heralding
Gaussian measurements.

Abstract: Determining the ultimate limits of quantum communication, such as the quantum
capacity of a channel and the distillable entanglement of a shared state,
remains a central challenge in quantum information theory, primarily due to the
phenomenon of superadditivity. This work develops Riemannian optimization
methods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on
these fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically
searches for state and channel extensions that minimize known
information-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of
all possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that
overcomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved
upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined
continuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new
state-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing
channel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the
previously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian
optimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish
lower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum
instruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by
parameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical
results for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our
methods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results.
Together, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and
powerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication
limits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel
coherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity
lower bounds in general.

Abstract: We introduce SamBa-GQW, a novel quantum algorithm for solving binary
combinatorial optimization problems of arbitrary degree with no use of any
classical optimizer. The algorithm is based on a continuous-time quantum walk
on the solution space represented as a graph. The walker explores the solution
space to find its way to vertices that minimize the cost function of the
optimization problem. The key novelty of our algorithm is an offline classical
sampling protocol that gives information about the spectrum of the problem
Hamiltonian. Then, the extracted information is used to guide the walker to
high quality solutions via a quantum walk with a time-dependent hopping rate.
We investigate the performance of SamBa-GQW on several quadratic problems,
namely MaxCut, maximum independent set, portfolio optimization, and
higher-order polynomial problems such as LABS, MAX-$k$-SAT and a quartic
reformulation of the travelling salesperson problem. We empirically demonstrate
that SamBa-GQW finds high quality approximate solutions on problems up to a
size of $n=20$ qubits by only sampling $n^2$ states among $2^n$ possible
decisions. SamBa-GQW compares very well also to other guided quantum walks and
QAOA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the scalability issues of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE), which struggle with large Hamiltonians due to the no-cloning theorem and barren plateaus.

Method: The proposed Titan framework employs a deep learning strategy to identify and freeze inactive parameters during initialization. It combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy with an adaptive neural architecture to ensure each training example is informative and resilient to barren plateaus.

Result: The study demonstrates that Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and requires 40% to 60% fewer circuit evaluations compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining or improving estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: Titan represents a significant advancement in making VQE more practical for quantum chemistry and materials science by addressing key scalability challenges.

Abstract: Variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading candidate for harnessing
quantum computers to advance quantum chemistry and materials simulations, yet
its training efficiency deteriorates rapidly for large Hamiltonians. Two issues
underlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in
circuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii)
deeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially
increasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose
a deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive
parameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of
Hamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.
The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of
parameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its
design combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring
each training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural
architecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark
transverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems
up to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60%
fewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or
surpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space,
Titan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE
to advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science.

Abstract: In their seminal work, Bennett et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (2002)] showed
that, with sufficient shared randomness, one noisy channel can simulate another
at a rate equal to the ratio of their capacities. We establish that when coding
above this channel interconversion capacity, the exact strong converse exponent
is characterized by a simple optimization involving the difference of the
corresponding R\'enyi channel capacities with H\"older dual parameters. We
further extend this result to the entanglement-assisted interconversion of
classical-quantum channels, showing that the strong converse exponent is
likewise determined by differences of sandwiched R\'enyi channel capacities.
The converse bound is obtained by relaxing to non-signaling assisted codes and
applying H\"older duality together with the data processing inequality for
R\'enyi divergences. Achievability is proven by concatenating refined channel
coding and simulation protocols that go beyond first-order capacities,
attaining an exponentially small conversion error, remaining robust under small
variations in the input distribution, and tolerating a sublinear gap between
the conversion rates.

Abstract: The characterization of positive, non-CP linear maps is a central problem in
operator algebras and quantum information theory, where such maps serve as
entanglement witnesses. This work introduces and systematically studies a new
convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual
to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a
complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant
maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP,
thereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of
copositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous
framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary
application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps
$\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive
exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or
decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic
parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive
indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from
infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as
Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes
of symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares
(SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of
copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for
different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this
duality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke
states that are simultaneously entangled and $\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic
extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n
\geq 5$.

Abstract: Quantum phases at zero temperature can be characterized as equivalence
classes under local unitary transformations: two ground states within a gapped
phase can be transformed into each other via a local unitary circuit. We
generalize this circuit-based characterization of phases to systems at
finite-temperature thermal equilibrium described by Gibbs states. We construct
a channel circuit that approximately transforms one Gibbs state into another
provided the two are connected by a path in parameter space along which a
certain correlation-decay condition holds. For finite-dimensional systems of
linear size $L$ and approximation error $\epsilon$, the locality of the circuit
is ${\rm polylog}({\rm poly}(L)/\epsilon)$. The correlation-decay condition,
which we specify, is expected to be satisfied in the interior of many
noncritical thermal phases, including those displaying discrete symmetry
breaking and topological order. As an application, we show that any system in
the same thermal phase as a zero-temperature topological code coherently
preserves quantum information for a macroscopically long time, establishing
self-correction as a universal property of thermal phases. As part of the
proof, we provide explicit encoding and decoding channel circuits to encode
information into, and decode it from, a system in thermal equilibrium.

Abstract: Ferroaxial ordering, a spontaneous rotational distortion of the atomic
arrangement, brings about a cross-product-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
manifested as an electric toroidal dipole. We propose the light-induced
nonlinear Edelstein effect (NLEE) -- a second-order optical response in which a
static magnetization is induced by a time-dependent electric field -- as a
promising probe of ferroaxial ordering. First, we elucidate the relationship
between the NLEE tensor and the electric toroidal dipole. By decomposing the
polarization modes of light, we find that both the linearly polarized and
circularly polarized light couple to the electric toroidal dipole via distinct
mechanisms. We then demonstrate the NLEE using a minimal model that
incorporates ferroaxial ordering. Our analysis reveals that effective coupling
between orbital magnetization and SOC induces spin magnetization. In
particular, the spin magnetization is tilted owing to the electric toroidal
dipole; the tilt angle reflects the ratio between the ferroaxial-origin SOC and
the relativistic SOC.

Abstract: Light-matter interactions in chiral cavities offer a compelling route to
manipulate material properties by breaking fundamental symmetries such as
time-reversal symmetry. However, only a limited number of chiral cavity
implementations exhibiting broken time-reversal symmetry have been demonstrated
to date. These typically rely on either the application of strong magnetic
fields, circularly polarized Floquet driving, or the hybridization of cavity
modes with matter excitations in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Here, we
present a one-dimensional terahertz photonic-crystal cavity that exhibits
broken time-reversal symmetry. The cavity consists of a high-resistivity
silicon wafer sandwiched between lightly n-doped InSb wafers. By exploiting the
nonreciprocal response of a terahertz magnetoplasma and the exceptionally low
effective mass of electrons in InSb, we demonstrate a circularly polarized
cavity mode at 0.67 THz under a modest magnetic field of 0.3 T, with a quality
factor exceeding 50. Temperature-, magnetic field-, and polarization-dependent
measurements, supported by simulations, confirm the realization of a chiral
cavity with broken time-reversal symmetry. This platform offers a robust and
accessible approach for exploring chiral light--matter interactions and vacuum
dressed quantum condensed matter in the terahertz regime.

TL;DR: Designs an injection-locked terahertz oscillator combining electronic and photonic components to achieve high power and low phase noise, achieving 40 dB gain with nanowatt inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for terahertz applications necessitates oscillators with high power and low phase noise, which current solutions fail to meet adequately.

Method: Hybrid approach using injection locking of an electronic oscillator with a photomixed source, incorporating a resonant tunneling diode and dual-wavelength Brillouin laser.

Result: Achieved 40 dB gain for nanowatt-level signals and validated theoretical phase noise predictions for scalable terahertz oscillators.

Conclusion: This hybrid architecture offers a feasible path to scalable terahertz oscillators with the required performance for emerging technologies.

Abstract: High power and low phase noise oscillators at terahertz frequencies are
required for several burgeoning scientific and technological applications,
including radioastronomy, imaging, molecular spectroscopy, radar, and wireless
communications. Operating at terahertz oscillation frequencies presents unique
challenges based on the method of generation. Electronic oscillators can
produce ample power but suffer from relatively high phase noise due to the
nonlinear multiplication of microwave sources. Meanwhile, photomixing of
optical sources provides superior spectral purity but low usable power, due to
the limited bandwidth of the photomixer. We propose a hybrid solution involving
injection locking of an electronic oscillator, a resonant tunneling diode, by a
low phase noise photomixed source, a dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. In this
study, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept injection-locking amplifier at 260
GHz, achieving up to 40 dB gain for nanowatt-level input signals. For the first
time, we characterize the residual phase noise of an injection-locked waveguide
RTD, showing quantitative consistency with theoretical predictions based on
detailed analysis of its free-running noise. This architecture has the
potential to scale to frequencies of 1 THz and beyond, which would provide a
clear path to realize a terahertz oscillator with high power and low phase
noise.

Result: 在780 nm和1550 nm波长下，梯度索引常数分别为0.0057 μm⁻¹±0.0001 μm⁻¹和0.0055 μm⁻¹±0.0001 μm⁻¹。

Conclusion: 实验结果与已有文献一致，验证了测试方法的有效性。

Abstract: Gradient index (GRIN) fibers are used to improve the design of many fiber
optic devices. However, the properties of the GRIN fiber must be determined to
optimally engineer a device which incorporates GRIN fiber components. The index
of refraction of most GRIN fibers varies quadratically in the radial direction,
where the quadratic coefficient is characterized by the gradient index constant
$g$. We measured $g$ for Thorlabs GIF50C GRIN fiber at both $780~\mathrm{nm}$
and $1550~\mathrm{nm}$ using equipment which is commonly available in an optics
laboratory. This measurement was achieve by profiling the beam exiting various
lengths of GRIN fiber. A custom-built beam profiler was used, which enabled the
beam position to be referenced with respect to the facet of the GRIN fiber. We
report a gradient index constant of $0.0057~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1} \pm
0.0001~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1}$ at $780~\mathrm{nm}$ and $0.0055~\mathrm{\mu
m}^{-1} \pm 0.0001~\mathrm{\mu m}^{-1}$ at $1550~\mathrm{nm}$. These results
are in close agreement with previously reported gradient index constant
measurements made for different wavelengths.

Abstract: In this work, using the time-dependent density functional theory, we address
the electron tunneling triggered by short (single-cycle and several-cycle)
optical pulses in narrow metallic gaps under conditions relevant for actual
experiments. We identify photon-assisted tunneling with one-photon, two-photon,
and higher-order photon absorption, and we discuss the effect of the tunneling
barrier, applied bias, and strength of the optical field on transition from
photon-assisted tunneling (weak optical fields) to the optical field emission
at strong optical fields. The numerical single-electron calculations and an
analytical strong-field theory model are used to gain deeper insights into the
results of the time-dependent density functional theory calculations.
Additionally, our parameter-free calculations allow us to retrieve and explain
recent experimental results on optically induced transport in narrow metallic
gaps.

Abstract: Controlling the state of motion of optically levitated nanoparticles is
crucial for the advancement of precision sensing, fundamental tests of physics,
and the development of hybrid classical-quantum technologies. Experimentally,
such control can be achieved by pulsed modifications of the optical potential
confining the nanoparticle. Most frequently, the applied potential pulses are
parabolic in nanoparticle position, and they expand/squeeze or displace the
initial Gaussian state of motion to a modified Gaussian state. The
time-dependent mean values and covariance matrix of the phase-space variables
can fully characterize such a state. However, quasi-parabolic optical
potentials with added weak Duffing-type nonlinearity, encountered in real-world
experiments, can generally distort the state of motion to a non-Gaussian one,
for which the description based solely on the mean values and covariance matrix
fails. Here, we introduce a nonlinear transformation of the phase-space
coordinates using the concept of Fermat's spiral, which effectively removes the
state distortion induced by the Duffing-type nonlinearity and enables
characterization of the state of motion by the standard Gaussian-state metrics.
Comparisons of the experimental data with theoretical models show that the
proposed coordinate transformation can recover the ideal behavior of a harmonic
oscillator even after extended evolution of the system in the nonlinear
potential. The presented scheme enables the separation of the effects of the
applied state manipulation, the system's gradual thermalization, and the
nonlinearity of the confinement on the experimentally observed dynamics of the
system, thereby facilitating the design of advanced protocols for levitated
optomechanics.

tenfold efficiency increase in comparison to the most efficient non-modulated
waveguide, and up to 13 orders of magnitude efficiency enhancements relative to
solely phase-matched waveguides. Furthermore, we explore the implementation of
a highly efficient compact twin-photon source, tunable across the communication

Conclusion: The study opens new avenues for exploring advanced light-matter interactions with hybrid cavities for potential technological breakthroughs in quantum optics, sensing, and nonlinear photonics.}

Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to
tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant
modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances
alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement
and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling
and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as
precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz
(THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity
that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling
to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room
temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (> 30% of the anapole frequency)
between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons
that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally
aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the
linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and
enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface
correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of
polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables
strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of
quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.

Abstract: Computational techniques have gained significant traction in photonics,
enabling the co-design of hardware and data processing algorithms to
drastically simplify optical system architectures and improve their
performance. However, their application in optical frequency comb spectroscopy
remains considerably underexplored. In this work, we introduce a
non-interferometric approach to frequency comb spectroscopy based on
dynamically tailored electro-optic modulation. The core of our method is a
reconfigurable electro-optic comb generator capable of producing a sequence of
known comb spectra to interrogate a spectroscopic sample. Instead of recording
spectrally resolved or interferometric data, our system captures a set of
integrated optical power measurements--one per probe comb--from which the
sample's spectral response is computationally reconstructed by solving an
inverse problem. We present the theoretical foundations of this method, assess
its limitations, and validate it through numerical simulations. As a proof of
concept, we demonstrate the experimental reconstruction of several spectral
signatures, including a molecular absorption line at 1545 nm. For these
results, we use numerically computed spectra and experimentally measured power
values, all acquired within 10 milliseconds. Finally, we discuss potential
extensions and improvements of the method, as well as its integration into
chip-scale spectroscopic systems.

Abstract: This study demonstrates the realization of localized in-plane optomechanical
microcavities embedded within an electrostatic MEMS architecture. The system
consists of a curved, clamped-clamped microbeam, fabricated on a
silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. A green laser emitted from a Laser Doppler
Vibrometer (LDV), is directed perpendicularly onto the device under a vacuum
pressure of 7 mTorr, with the beam aligned to fill the gap between the movable
microbeam and its adjacent side fixed mirror. This configuration forms
localized cavity optomechanical resonators that enable the generation of
optomechanical soliton frequency combs through phonon lasing without electrical
excitation. The optomechanical resonators' dynamics are examined through
experiments and numerical simulations. First, the experimental findings unveil
that in electrostatic MEMS structures, the two reflective electrodes positioned
to form a capacitive gap can inadvertently form localized cavities. These
cavities significantly affect optical readouts, as the photodetected signal
encodes contributions from both Doppler-shifted electromagnetic waves and light
scattered from the intracavity optical field. This dual contributions can
distort mechanical response interpretation unless appropriately filtered.
Second, experiments show that optical pumping at various positions along the
microbeam induces periodic pulse trains with distinct free spectral ranges
(FSRs), each corresponding to different mechanical modes. Our results present
the generation of solitary optical wavepackets using in-plane localized
Fabry-P\'erot microcavities formed within a MEMS device. The results suggest a
path toward chip-scale, soliton frequency combs generators featuring frequency
spacing on the order of kilohertz, without relying on integrated fiber optics.

As a result, he was known as the father of quantum cosmology. He is best known
for two seminal papers with Stephen Hawking that introduced two quantum states
of fundamental importance: the "Hartle-Hawking vacuum" for matter fields
outside a black hole, and the "no-boundary wave function of the universe" for
cosmology. Jim (as everyone called him) was a warm and caring person who was
genuinely concerned with the success of his students, postdocs, and colleagues.
He was generous with his time and helped to foster a culture of a welcoming

*Francesco Del Porro,Jonas Pfeiffer,Alessia Platania,Samuele Silveravalle*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper explores the concept of gravitationally localized objects (GLOBs) as potential alternatives to classical black holes using asymptotically safe gravity. They identify a unique ultraviolet-complete trajectory in the Einstein-Weyl truncation to extract the Wilson coefficient of the Weyl-squared term, enabling the charting of a phase diagram of GLOBs. Their results show that wormholes dominate a large portion of the diagram, while classical Bachian naked singularities are disfavored. Their work illustrates how quantum gravity can constrain effective field theory and the associated set of allowed spacetimes, yielding a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions rather than a single alternative to classical black holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing tension between quantum gravity and general relativity calls for exploring alternative theories of gravity that can reconcile these frameworks. This paper aims to address that tension by investigating the concept of gravitationally localized objects (GLOBs) as potential quantum gravity alternatives to classical black holes.

Method: The authors use the framework of asymptotically safe gravity to study the Einstein-Weyl truncation. They identify the unique ultraviolet-complete trajectory emanating from the asymptotically safe fixed point and use it to extract the Wilson coefficient of the Weyl-squared term. This allows them to chart the corresponding GLOBs in a phase diagram.

Result: The authors find that wormholes dominate a large portion of the phase diagram of GLOBs, while classical Bachian naked singularities become disfavored. Their results illustrate how quantum gravity can constrain effective field theory and the associated set of allowed spacetimes, yielding a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions rather than a single alternative to classical black holes.

Conclusion: This paper provides a direct route to charting the landscape of potential alternatives to classical black holes, demonstrating how quantum gravity can constrain effective field theory. The results suggest a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions with wormholes dominating a large portion of the phase diagram.

Abstract: Computing the gravitational effective action provides a direct route to
charting the landscape of admissible black hole spacetimes and their
alternatives, which we will collectively call "gravitationally localized
objects" (GLOBs). In this work, we provide a proof of principle of this idea
within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. Focusing on the
Einstein-Weyl truncation, we identify the unique ultraviolet-complete
trajectory emanating from the asymptotically safe fixed point and use it to
extract the Wilson coefficient of the Weyl-squared term. This allows us to
chart the corresponding GLOBs in a "phase diagram", showing that wormholes
dominate a large portion of it, whereas the classical Bachian naked
singularities become disfavored. Our results illustrate how quantum gravity can
constrain effective field theory and the associated set of allowed spacetimes,
yielding a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions rather than a
single alternative to classical black holes.

Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics of non-minimally coupled matter models
using the Brown's variational approach to relativistic fluids in General
Relativity. After decomposing the Ricci scalar into a bulk and a boundary term,
we construct new models by coupling the bulk term to the fluid variables and an
external scalar field. Using dynamical systems techniques, we study models of
this type and find that they can give rise to both early-time inflationary
behaviour and late-time accelerated expansion. Moreover, these models also
contain very interesting features that are rarely seen in this context. For
example, we find dark energy models which exhibit phantom crossing in the
recent past. Other possibilities include models that give a viable past
evolution but terminate in a matter-dominated universe. The dynamical systems
themselves display an array of mathematically interesting phenomena, including
spirals, centres, and non-trivial bifurcations depending on the chosen
parameter values.

Conclusion: 引力迹异常参数α改变了黑洞模型中QPO频率关系和轨道半径，且通过观测数据可约束α和黑洞参数，RP模型在几类候选者中表现较好。

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravitational trace
anomaly on the circular motion of test particles around black holes (BHs) and
its implications for quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in various theoretical
models. Beginning with the equations of motion, we study the effects on
effective potential, angular momentum, specific energy, and the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) induced by the anomaly parameter $\alpha$. The
fundamental frequencies are calculated. Moreover, we examine several QPO
models, including PR, RP, WD, TD, and ER2-ER4, and study the relationship
between the upper and lower QPO frequencies as well as the corresponding
resonance radii for frequency ratios of 1:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4. Our results
show that increasing $\alpha$ leads to deviations from the Schwarzschild case
in both upper and lower QPO frequencies correlations and QPO orbital radii,
with model-dependent trends. Further, we constrain the BH parameters using the
observational data using MCMC analysis. Finally, we calculate the upper and
lower QPO frequencies for a few BH candidates on the basis of the RP model
using the constrained parameter values and find a good agreement with the
observed results.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include
conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated
minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through
external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an
exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are
introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson
brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics
remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce
velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence
principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust,
radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified
approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a
framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature,
and Planck-scale physics.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper studies how cosmological modifications affect Schwarzschild-like black holes, focusing on photon propagation, gravitational lensing, and shadow observation. They modify the Schwarzschild metric using a parameter α and find that the gravitational deflection angle and shadow angular diameter decrease as α increases, suggesting that these effects can constrain cosmology-inspired models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding black hole physics and gravitational lensing is crucial for exploring the nature of gravity and its modifications, especially in the context of cosmology.

Method: The authors use the Rindler-Ishak method to compute the gravitational deflection angle, considering finite-distance corrections for non-asymptotically flat spacetimes. They analyze the effective potential of null geodesics, identifying photon orbits based on critical parameters and evaluating angular diameter dependency on model parameters.

Result: The gravitational deflection angle and black hole shadow angular diameter decrease with increasing α, providing a potential avenue for constraining modified gravity models using precision astrometry and lensing observations.

Conclusion: These findings imply that high-precision astrometric and lensing observations can constrain cosmology-inspired modifications to gravity, bridging astrophysical black holes with cosmic expansion and offering new insights into gravitational physics in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: We investigate cosmology-driven modifications to Schwarzschild-like black
hole spacetimes and analyze their impact on photon propagation, gravitational
lensing, and shadow observation. The gravitational deflection angle is computed
using the Rindler-Ishak method, which incorporates finite-distance corrections
and provides a consistent framework for non-asym-ptotically flat spacetimes.
The effective potential for null geodesics exhibits a single unstable maximum
corresponding to the photon sphere, and we study photon orbits classified
according to the critical impact parameter into capture, escape, and unstable
circular trajectories. Our analysis shows that the deflection angle decreases
with increasing model parameter $(\alpha)$, resulting in weaker light bending
compared to the Schwarzschild case. In addition, we examine the angular
diameter of the black hole shadow as measured by a static observer,
highlighting its dependence on the cosmological modification parameters. These
results suggest that high-precision astrometric and lensing observations can
place meaningful constraints on cosmology-inspired modifications to gravity,
thereby linking astrophysical black holes with cosmic expansion and offering a
novel probe of gravitational physics in strong-field regimes.

Abstract: We construct the Lagrangian formulation of a micro-structured spinning,
dilating and shearing (deformable) test body, moving in arbitrary
non-Riemannian backgrounds possessing all geometrical entities of curvature,
torsion and non-metricity. We start with a Lagrangian of a generic form that
depends on the particle's velocity, its material frame and its absolute
derivative, and the background geometry consisting of a metric and an
independent affine connection. Performing variations of the path and the
material frame, we derive the equations of motion for the particle that govern
the evolution of its momentum and hypermomentum in this generic background. The
reported equations of motion generalize those of a spinning particle (Mathisson
\cite{Mathisson:1937zz}, Papapetrou \cite{Papapetrou:1951pa}, Dixon
\cite{Dixon:1974xoz}) by the inclusion of the dilation and shear (hadronic)
currents of matter. Using the derived equations of motion, a generalized
conserved quantity is also found. Further conserved quantities that can be
obtained by appropriate supplementary conditions are also discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave detection and analysis have become crucial for understanding binary black hole mergers. Efficient parameter estimation methods are essential for timely data interpretation.

Method: This research introduces a novel F-statistic method that reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space by analytically maximizing the likelihood over luminosity distance and polarization angle. A new formulation for the Bayes factor is also introduced to assess performance against standard full frequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference.

Result: The F-statistic method demonstrates significant advantages, including approximately 70% faster computation compared to FFD Bayesian inference. It maintains statistical stability across different sampler configurations, with minimal changes in log-Bayes factors (less than 0.1) and consistently low Jensen-Shannon divergence values between analysis runs. Additionally, while it produces slightly broader constraints on some parameters, it offers a more honest uncertainty quantification, particularly valuable in high-dimensional parameter spaces with complex posterior structures.

Conclusion: The F-statistic method presents a powerful tool for gravitational wave data analysis, especially in the era of high-rate detections with future observatories like LIGO and Virgo.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the F-statistic method for
parameter estimation of gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary black hole
mergers. By analytically maximizing the likelihood over the luminosity distance
and polarization angle, this approach reduces the dimensionality of the
parameter space to enhance computational efficiency. We also introduce a novel
formulation for calculating the Bayes factor for the F-statistic, enabling a
quantitative assessment of its performance against standard full
frequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference. Using the benchmark event GW150914,
we demonstrate that the F-statistic method is not only approximately $70\%$
faster than FFD but is also statistically stable across different sampler
configurations, with a log-Bayes factor between runs smaller than $0.1$.
Furthermore, the F-statistic exhibits superior stability against changes in
sampler configuration, yielding consistently lower Jensen-Shannon divergence
values between analysis runs. While the F-statistic produces slightly broader
constraints on some parameters, we argue this represents a more honest
uncertainty quantification, particularly in high-dimensional parameter spaces
with complex posterior structures. These results highlight the significant
advantages of the F-statistic method for GW data analysis, positioning it as a
powerful tool for the era of high-rate detections with future observatories.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种有效且简便的残差测试方法，为引力波信号分析提供了一种新的工具。

Abstract: The residual test is commonly used to check the agreement between the
gravitational wave signal and the theoretical waveform template. The basic idea
of the residual test is to subtract the best-fit waveform from the data and
then check whether the remaining data (i.e., the residuals) are consistent with
the instrumental noise or not. We apply the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the
Anderson-Darling test and the chi-squared test as goodness-of-fit test to
examine the residuals of events in the third gravitational-wave transient
catalog and find no statistically significant deviation from the noise.
Although our method is sensitive only to the loud events, it does not rely on
the cross-correlation between detectors. A single-detector event suffices for
our residual analysis, and the test is simple and computationally inexpensive.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Most previous studies on relativistic quantum information have primarily
focused on the vacuum state $|0\rangle$ and the first excited state $|1\rangle$
in two-mode entangled systems. In this work, we go beyond these limitations by
considering arbitrary $q$-th excited states $|q\rangle$, aiming to investigate
their role in preserving quantum resources. We analyze the influence of the
Hawking effect on multipartite quantum states in the Schwarzschild spacetime,
with particular attention to quantum entanglement and coherence. Our results
show that, under the influence of the Hawking effect, increasing the excitation
number $q$ leads to a reduction in quantum entanglement and mutual information,
while enhancing quantum coherence. This indicates that the Hawking effect on
excited multipartite states tends to degrade quantum correlations but
simultaneously protects quantum coherence in curved spacetime. Therefore, when
implementing quantum information protocols in gravitational settings, reducing
the excitation number $q$ is favorable for maintaining entanglement, whereas
increasing $q$ may be advantageous for tasks that rely on quantum coherence in
relativistic quantum information processing.

Conclusion: 通过去近by事件的方法有效降低 shot 噪声，提升了二致中子星引力波 背景的探测敏感性。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of shot noise on the stochastic gravitational wave
background generated by binary neutron star mergers, and confirm that the
overall background can be significantly influenced by relatively few
neighboring, loud events. To mitigate the shot noise, we propose a procedure to
remove nearby events by notching them out in the time-frequency domain.
Additionally, we quantify the cosmic/sample variance of the resulting
background after notching, and we study the deviation between the
cross-correlation measurement and the theoretical prediction of the background.
Taking both effects into account, we find that the resulting sensitivity loss
in the search for an isotropic background formed by binary neutron star mergers
is minimal, and is limited to $\lesssim 4\%$ below 40 Hz, and to $\lesssim 1\%$
above 40 Hz.

Abstract: Optical atomic clocks play a crucial role in fundamental physics,
relativistic geodesy, and the future redefinition of the SI second. Standard
operation relies on cyclic interrogation sequences, which alternate between
atomic interrogation and dead time used for state preparation and readout. This
approach introduces the Dick effect, where laser frequency noise aliases onto
the atomic transition frequency. Although reducing laser noise improves clock
stability, the Dick effect remains a key limitation. In this work, we
demonstrate a zero-dead-time optical clock based on two interleaved ensembles
of cold $^{87}\text{Sr}$ atoms. Our system significantly suppresses this noise
and achieves a fractional frequency instability at the $10^{-19}$ level between
10,000 and 20,000 seconds over repeated measurements, with a best value of $2.9
\times 10^{-19}$ at $\tau = 20,000$ seconds. The estimated long-term stability
based on the combined data of these measurements reaches $2.5 \times 10^{-19}$
at one day. These results represent a more than ninefold improvement over a
conventional single-ensemble clock, highlighting its potential for
next-generation timekeeping applications.

Motivation: I am a paper analyst, and I need this **tldr** as a too-long didn't read summary. I want a succinct understanding of the paper's main findings.

Method: The paper uses GPU-accelerated numerical simulations to explore the chaotic dynamics of atom-ion interactions in a Paul-trapped ion system.

Result: The study finds that lower energy collisions with more massive atoms lead to the formation of atom-ion complexes, which exhibit fractal chaotic behavior. This chaos is linked to the heating of the ion.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the role of low-density atomic environments in inducing chaos in trapped ions, which has implications for precision metrology and quantum information processing.

Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a Paul-trapped ion in a low-density bath
of atoms above 1 $\mu\textrm{K}$. We find that lower energy collisions with
more massive atoms, especially at energies less than the initial micromotion
heating, are more likely to form atom-ion complexes. These complexes evolve in
a fractal structure for every scattering observable, showing non-hyperbolic
chaotic dynamics. To explore the chaotic dynamics, we use a GPU-accelerated
methodology allowing us to run over $3\times 10^{8}$ trajectories of a
$^{174}$Yb$^+$ and different atoms. As a result, after analyzing the dynamics
as a function of the atom species, collision energy, trap parameters, and
ion-atom potential depth, we find a link between heating and the onset of chaos
in the first atom-ion interaction that occurs when a low-density atomic bath is
merged with a trapped ion.

Motivation: Improving text-to-image generation through enhancing condition distributions for better quality and relevance of generated images.

Method: Adapted windowed image enhancement techniques inspired by CLIP and Advocat-2 to align the conditional distributions in feature space between the text encoder and image decoder in the transformer.

Result: Experiments show that this method achieves higher sample quality and better semantic relevance compared to standard techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing generation tasks.

Conclusion: This approach provides a new direction for enhancing generation quality by focusing on conditional distribution alignment, which can be further generalized to other tasks and architectures.

Abstract: The dynamic of thermosensitive neuronal networks under the influence of
external electric fields is explored, focusing on hybrid coupling models that
incorporate both electrical and chemical synapses. Numerical simulations reveal
a variety of complex behaviors, including coherent, incoherent, and chimera
states, which are influenced by the frequency of the external field and the
cell size. Specificaly chemical coupling is shown to enhances the appearance of
a typical chimera states called traveling chimera states, while the external
electric field modulates synchronization based on its frequency. Low-frequency
fields induce localized synchronization, whereas high-frequency fields exert
minimal influence. The study also investigates the role of intrinsic electric
fields, represented by cell size, and their effect on both individual neuron
activity and network dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of how
external fields control collective neuronal behavior and open up new
possibilities for the modulation of neural activity.

ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in
the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal
selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over
previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and
data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including
sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to
recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven
readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range
of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and
time-correlated photon counting experiments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is likely to advance muon tomography, an important imaging technique that doesn't damage materials.

Method: The method involves creating four compact scintillating fiber modules, each 100 cm long, using two layers of 1 mm diameter fibers. These fibers are read out using silicon photomultipliers with a 2 mm pitch and coupled to Citiroc1A-based electronics. Performance was tested using cosmic-ray muons.

Result: The detectors achieved a detection efficiency above 97% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, showing consistent performance across various distances from the readout end.

Conclusion: This detector design is suitable for compact and large-area applications, enhancing the effectiveness of muon tomography.

Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that exploits
cosmic-ray muons from multiple directions. Its performance critically relies on
stable, large-area, and high-resolution position-sensitive detectors. In this
work, we report on the development of four compact scintillating fiber modules,
each 100 cm long and composed of two staggered layers of 1 mm diameter fibers.
The fibres are read out at one end by one-dimensional silicon photomultiplier
arrays with a 2 mm pitch, coupled to Citiroc1A-based front-end electronics. The
modules were characterised with cosmic-ray muons, yielding a detection
efficiency above 97\% and a mean spatial resolution of about 0.56 mm, with
uniform response over different distances from the readout end. These results
demonstrate the suitability of this detector design for compact and large-area
systems in muon tomography applications.

*T. Yan,J. Songwadhana,A. Limphirat,Y. Yan,H. Lu,F. Ning,P. Zheng,C. Yang,G. Zhang,W. Sreethawong,K. Khosonthongkee,N. Suwonjandee*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: The study examines the impact of steel rebars and TT bridges in the JUNO structure on coil shielding. Simulations show that despite the presence of carbon steel structures near central detector areas, the residual magnetic field experienced by PMTs remains within acceptable limits (10% for CD-PMTs and 20% for Veto-PMTs compared to geomagnetic field). Maximum magnetic field strengths are 9% and 18% of geomagnetic field strength for CD-PMTs and Veto-PMTs respectively, indicating minimal impact on detection efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the shielding effectiveness of structural components in a large-scale experiment is crucial for maintaining instrumentation performance, particularly in the context of high background fields like geomagnetic fields.

Method: Numerical simulations were conducted to assess the magnetic field distribution and its impact on photon detectors within the JUNO setup.

Result: The residual magnetic fields experienced by PMTs are well within the acceptable thresholds defined by the JUNO experiment.

Conclusion: The structural components' shielding effect is sufficient to maintain PMT detection efficiency within acceptable limits despite suboptimal material choices (carbon steel). This validates the design approach for construction within the JUNO detector structure constraints.

Abstract: We study the impact of the carbon steel rebars and the steel TT bridge within
the JUNO structure on the shielding effect of the coils. Our simulations
demonstrate that despite the presence of carbon steel structures of the rebars
of the water pool and the TT bridge within the central detector vicinity, the
residual magnetic field experienced by the PMTs remains within the acceptable
limit established by the JUNO experiment of 10% for CD-PMTs and 20% for
Veto-PMTs, compared to the geomagnetic field. The maximum magnetic fields
experienced by the CD-PMTs and Veto-PMTs are 9% and 18% of the geomagnetic
field strength, respectively. These findings indicate that the residual
magnetic field has minimal impacts on the PMTs detection efficiency.

The success of lock acquisition demonstrates the potential of deep reinforcement learning in this field, with opportunities for further methodological improvements and optimizations.

Abstract: This proceedings contains our considerations made during and after fruitful
discussions held at EuCAIFCon 2025. We explore the use of deep reinforcement
learning for autonomous locking of Fabry-Perot optical cavities in non-linear
regimes, with relevance to gravitational-wave detectors. A custom Gymnasium
environment with a time-domain simulator enabled training of agents such as
deep deterministic policy gradient, achieving reliable lock acquisition for
both low- and high-finesse cavities, including Virgo-like parameters. We also
discuss possible improvements with Twin Delayed DDPG, Soft Actor Critic and
meta-reinforcement learning, as well as strategies for low-latency execution
and off-line policy updates to address hardware limitations. These studies lay
the groundwork for future deployment of reinforcement learning-based control in
real optical setups.

Abstract: The immuno-infrared sensor detects target proteins in solution. Exemplary,
the initial misfolding of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in blood is measured,
enabling early risk prediction of Alzheimer's disease in the preclinical stage.
Antibodies concentrate the target protein on the functionalized attenuated
total reflection crystal surface. A quantum cascade laser is used to measure
the amide I band, which indicates the secondary structure distribution of Abeta
