We have observed these anomalous trends even in conditions where known mechanisms, such as overhang equalization and excessive electrolyte oxidation, are unlikely to be significant. Here, we combine simulations and experiments to analyze four cases that can produce increased capacity in Si cells. Three of these pathways relate to break-in processes, where improved mass and charge transport can lead to increased access to active electrode domains and decreased cell impedance. The fourth case occurs at high levels of prelithiation, when the positive electrode (PE) is completely replenished with Li+ at the end of cell discharge. We show that the commonality among these mechanisms is that the underlying transformations change the potentials experienced by electrodes at the end of half-cycles, increasing the Li+ inventory available to the cell. A quantitative framework to describe these effects is presented, enabling these ideas to be extended to other battery systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper shows that increased lithium capacity in silicon lithium-ion batteries at early life stages is due to four specific mechanisms, including diffusion-restriting, relaxations, and capacity stress during cell lithiation and subsequent lithiation\u6062\u590d.", "motivation": "\u7535\u6c60\u5bb9\u91cf\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u589e\u52a0\u662f\u7535\u52a8\u884c\u4e1a\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u56db\u79cd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u56db\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\u5305\u62ec\u6269\u6563\u9650\u5236\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u677e\u5f1b\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u538b\u529b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5feb\u5145\u5feb\u653e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u538b\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5171\u540c\u70b9\u662f\u6539\u53d8\u7535\u6c60\u7ed3\u675f\u534a\u5468\u671f\u7684\u7535\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9502\u79bb\u5b50\u5e93\u5b58\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u7535\u6c60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The use of this formation on substantially elliptical heliocentric Kepler orbits allows measuring gradients of gravitation field in Solar system. The accuracy of the measurements will be sufficient to confirm or to refute modified theories of gravity. In this paper a new approach for the description of this formation is presented. The analytical solutions of the linearized motion equations are obtained. The distinctive feature of the solutions is that they use Cartesian coordinates of one of the spacecraft, termed the chief. These solutions have a clear physical meaning. It is shown, that the volume of a tetrahedron formed by spacecraft is a polynomial of 3-rd degree of Cartesian coordinates of the chief. The polynomial's coefficients are functions of initial spacecraft coordinates and velocities and linearly depend on time. If all spacecraft have the same periods of rotation around the Sun, the volume is a polynomial of 2-nd degree of the chief coordinates with time-independent coefficients. In this case the volume can be zeroed from 0 to 4 times per the period.

While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers.

Despite the success in measuring velocity differences, however, it is still quite challenging in probing emergent excitations' anomalous dimensions experimentally. We propose a off-diagonal dissipative response protocol, leveraging dissipative response theory (DRT), to directly detect spin-charge separation. By selectively dissipating spin-$\\downarrow$ particles and measuring the spin-$\\uparrow$ response, we uncover a universal temporal signature: the off-diagonal response exhibits a crossover from cubic-in-time ($t^3$) growth at short times to linear-in-time ($t$) decay at long times. Crucially, the coefficients $\\varkappa^s$ (short-time) and $\\varkappa^l$ (long-time) encode the distinct anomalous dimensions and velocities of spinons and holons, providing unambiguous evidence of fractionalization. This signal vanishes trivially without spin-charge separation. Our predictions, verified numerically via tDMRG, with microscopic parameters linking with Luttinger parameters by Bethe ansatz, establish off-diagonal dissipative response as a probe of quantum fractionalization in synthetic quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fractionalization of symmetry in quantum systems has been studied, but its experimental detection remains challenging.

This behavior correlates with the presence of fractional excitations, providing unambiguous evidence of spin-charge separation.

In bounds maximizing certain OPE coefficients, we find a plethora of sharp features, such as kinks and ridges, as a function of scaling dimensions. We show that some of these features correspond to known theories, but there are many others that are equally strong but do not match known CFTs. We argue that these features are robust to raising numerical order and could then correspond to numerous as yet unknown CFTs.

This problem is pronounced in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where strong mutual inductance between a receive coil (RC) and a metamaterial (MM) degrades B1 performance. Here, we introduce a non-Hermitian complex-coupling decoupling strategy based on a dual-resonator model. By engineering a phase delay in the coupling pathway, an imaginary coupling component is created, driving the system from the PT-symmetric to the anti-PT-symmetric phase and enabling eigenmode degeneracy without added dissipation. Implemented through a high-permittivity ceramic layer, this mechanism restores single-mode resonance in the MM - RC system and suppresses frequency splitting. Simulations show a ~14-fold B1 enhancement compared with the strongly repulsive regime.

While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we extend the recently proposed MB-PIPNet framework to general covalently bonded molecular systems by combining monomer-based energy decomposition, permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) descriptors, and neural networks within a fragmentation-based strategy. Within this framework, the total potential energy is represented as a sum of effective monomeric contributions, where PIPs provide compact and chemically motivated descriptions of both monomer internal structures and their local chemical environments. As a proof-of-concept application, we apply the MB-PIPNet framework to linear alkanes, using n-Tetradecane as a representative system, and benchmark its performance against established atomistic machine-learning models. The resulting MB-PIPNet potential accurately reproduces reference ab initio electronic energies and reliably captures key molecular properties, including torsional potential energy profiles, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vibrational power spectra obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.

Motivated by this goal, we study several classes of fault-tolerant gadget constructions consisting of Clifford gates acting on the physical qubits, including transversal gadgets, code automorphisms, and fold-transversal gadgets. While stabilizer codes encoding a single logical qubit, most notably the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, are known to admit transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group, no analogous examples are known for codes encoding multiple logical qubits. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem establishing that no stabilizer code admits a fully transversal implementation of the Clifford group on more than one logical qubit. We further strengthen this result by showing that fold-transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group are impossible for stabilizer codes encoding more than two logical qubits. More generally, we introduce the notion of k-fold transversal gadgets and prove that implementing the full Clifford group on k logical qubits requires at least k-fold transversal gadgets at the physical level. In addition, we analyze code-automorphism based constructions and demonstrate that they also fail to realize the full Clifford group on multiple logical qubits for any stabilizer code. Together, these results place fundamental constraints on fault-tolerant Clifford gadget design and show that stabilizer codes supporting the full logical Clifford group on multiple logical qubits via these architectures do not exist. Since the Clifford group is a core component of universal gate sets, our findings imply that quantum computing with codes encoding multiple logical qubits within a single code block necessarily entails more complex constructions for fault tolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u5b58\u5728\u81f3\u591a\u4e00\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u88c1\u526a\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5168\u53bb\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u53bb\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53bb\u9519 gadgets \u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u903b\u8f91\u88c1\u526a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u9519\u4f53\u7801\u7684\u53bb\u9519 gadgets\uff08\u5982\u5168\u9519\u4f4d\u5f0f gadget\u3001\u4ee3\u6570\u5065\u5907\u5f0f gadget \u548c\u6298\u53e0\u5168\u9519\u4f4d\u5f0f gadget\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u67d0\u4e9b gadgets \u4e0d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u903b\u8f91\u88c1\u526a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7801\u7684 going-tolerant \u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e00\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7801\u5df2\u77e5\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u53bb\u9519\u88c1\u526a\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7801\u5982\u53cc\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7801\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6b63\u4ea4\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u88c1\u526a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u5fc5\u987b\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53bb\u9519\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u652f\u6301\u591a\u903b\u8f91\u4f4d\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

Despite the large number of experimental works divulging the use of graphene in anticorrosion coatings, there is no report on the numerical modelling and simulation of the relationships between the orientation of graphene sheets in composite coatings and the introduced corrosion protection efficiency, to our knowledge. Herein, it is tried to model the influence of the orientation of graphene sheets dispersed in organic coatings on the diffusivity and flux of corrosive substances besides the corrosion initiation time of the protected substrates. To discover the relationship between the graphene orientation and corrosion-related phenomena, this study introduces a novel model consisting of a trigonometric factor named unprotected projected surface area proportion, which calculates corrosion-related parameters based on the principal Fick's laws. The model reveals that the decrease in the angle between graphene sheets and the substrate is highly beneficial for postponing the corrosion onset. It is accordingly estimated that a mismatch angle of 10 degree can slow down the diffusion process significantly and delay the corrosion initiation by around 65 times in a 100 micron thick epoxy/graphene composite coating in comparison to the counterpart with the perpendicular alignment. The predicted corrosion parameters were in a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the merit of the proposed model. Thus, this model can be further employed as the fundamental of future research on the optimum graphene orientation in anticorrosion composite coatings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a N\u00e9el ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to N\u00e9el phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the N\u00e9el order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$.

Numerical simulations indicate that, compared to standard pulses, the optimized pulses maintain high atomic manipulation fidelity over an extended range of laser frequency detunings and intensity fluctuations.

In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model.

This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Abstract discusses how a one-dimensional Hilbert space in quantum gravity can still yield predictable physics by conditioning on observational data, leading to semiclassical states and classical probabilities.

Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole.

To fully exploit their nonlinear behavior for inverse design, it is essential to learn the full stress-strain response rather than relying on bulk quantities, motivating the use of neural operators for function-to-function mapping. However, data-driven modeling of nonlinear response for metamaterials is severely constrained by the limited availability of costly experimental data. Here, we propose a Bayesian multi-fidelity deep operator network that aggregates abundant low-fidelity finite element simulations with sparse high-fidelity experimental data from in-situ nanomechanical experiments on spinodal metamaterials, enabling heterogeneous information aggregation. A hybrid Bayesian active learning strategy is introduced to select informative samples by jointly maximizing epistemic uncertainty and geometric diversity of the microstructure, substantially reducing the cost of 3D nonlinear simulations. This approach adaptively trains the low-fidelity operator, which is then augmented by a high-fidelity Bayesian residual learner. We demonstrate that only 22 strategically selected samples from a design pool of 3000 are sufficient to achieve an 84.1 percent reduction in MSE compared to the high-fidelity baseline. The framework significantly outperforms single-fidelity baselines, providing superior predictions for full nonlinear stress-strain responses as well as stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. This work provides a robust, data-efficient pathway for the inverse design and constitutive modeling of cellular metamaterials.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts.

Through the extraordinary precision of QED, the SM predicts the energy levels of simple systems such as the hydrogen atom with up to 13 significant digits, making hydrogen spectroscopy an ideal test bed. The consistency of physical constants extracted from different transitions in hydrogen using QED, such as the proton charge radius $r_\\mathrm{p}$, constitutes a test of the theory. However, values of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ from recent measurements of atomic hydrogen are partly discrepant with each other and with a more precise value from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen. This prevents a test of QED at the level of experimental uncertainties. Here we present a measurement of the 2S-6P transition in atomic hydrogen with sufficient precision to distinguish between the discrepant values of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ and enable rigorous testing of QED and the SM overall. Our result $\u03bd^{}_{\\text{2S-6P}}$ = 730,690,248,610.79(48) kHz gives a value of $r_\\mathrm{p}$ = 0.8406(15) fm at least 2.5-fold more precise than from other atomic hydrogen determinations and in excellent agreement with the muonic value. The SM prediction of the transition frequency (730,690,248,610.79(23) kHz) is in excellent agreement with our result, testing the SM to 0.7 parts per trillion (ppt) and, specifically, bound-state QED corrections to 0.5 parts per million (ppm), their most precise test so far.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Such a scenario admits a holographic description in terms of a cosmological braneworld embedded in the linear dilaton five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. In this framework, dark matter originates from the linear dilaton bulk black hole, whose phase we show to be thermodynamically favored at all temperatures. We present a natural freeze-in mechanism for the production of holographic dark matter, in which the bulk black hole is fed by energy leaking from the brane after inflation. Our model is characterized by two free parameters, one of which, the position of the black hole horizon, is fixed by the observed dark matter abundance. The remaining parameter, the 5D Planck scale $M_5$, is consistent with all current experimental bounds provided that $M_5\\gtrsim 3\\times 10^5$ TeV.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u5f3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u9690\u79d8 Sector \u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u6216\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7531\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6784\u6210\u3002\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u4e94\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e4c\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d,\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6e90\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u9ed1\u4f53,\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6e29\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u8be5\u73af\u8282\u662f\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u5229\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236,\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea7\u751f\u6b64\u7c7b\u6697\u7269\u8d28,\u5728\u9ed1\u4f53\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u80fd\u91cf,\u8be5\u80fd\u91cf\u4ece\u540e\u65b9\u5206\u88c2\u540e\u4ece Brane \u7ed9\u51fa\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570,\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570,\u5373\u9ed1\u4f53\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6 Horizon \u4f4d\u7f6e,\u7531\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570,\u53735\u7ef4 Planck \u5c3a\u5ea6M_5,\u5728M_5>3\u00d710^5 \u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b,\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u754c\u9650\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u662f\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d missing \u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7ec4\u6210\u4e4b\u4e00,\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u63a2\u7d22\u6d89\u53ca Dark Matter \u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u4e94\u7ef4\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b,\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22 Dark Matter \u7684\u5b64\u771f\u8eab\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e String \u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u548c Thermodynamics,\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e94\u7ef4\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u5c42\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u9ed1\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u540c\u65f6,\u5229\u7528 Cosmology \u548c Particle Physics \u7684\u7406\u8bba,\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u5b66,\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86 String \u7406\u8bba,PDE\u7406\u8bba,\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66,\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5efa\u6a21,\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0: 1) \u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u9ed1\u4f53\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6e29\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u662f\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u5229\u7684\u30022) \u80fd\u6e90\u4ece\u540e\u65b9 Departure \u6765\u81ea Brane \u88ab\u7528\u6765\u5582\u517b Black Hole,\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u30023) \u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e,\u5176\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u7684 Planck \u6807\u5ea6 M_5 \u5fc5\u987b\u5927\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u4e8e\u7ea63\u00d710^5 TeV\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3,\u5e2e\u52a9\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa,\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4e94\u7ef4\u7ebf\u6027\u504f\u5bfc\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u9ed1\u4f53\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u7269,\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u4ea7\u2014\u2014\u4ece Brane \u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6cc4\u6f0finputs\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u7406\u8bba\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86 Dark Matter \u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f,\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u53c2\u6570\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u73b0\u4ee3\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Representatives of these defects act as bright single photon sources, spin-1 systems, and multiproperty atomic-scale sensors. They are predominantly investigated in bulk hBN films, where defects are decoupled from surface and interfacial effects. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of surface defects optically active in the green/yellow visible spectral range, which exhibit photophysical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts. High-power resonant laser illumination quenched the emission from the ensemble of such defects, which was attributed to a light-driven structural reconfiguration. The quenched defects were found to recover their emissive capabilities via a thermal cycling process, revealing an activation energy of 24.5 meV for the structural transition. Alternatively, permanent quenching of the defects was triggered by surface chemistry, involving lithiation-enabled attachment of functional groups. These mechanisms were utilized to realize negative-contrast direct laser writing, designing arbitrary geometric emissive patterns on demand in a microscopic configuration. The surface-active radiative centers in hBN appear particularly attractive for exploring environmental sensitivity, surface science, and coupling to photonic structures or electronic devices by taking unique advantage of the two-dimensional characteristics of the host lattice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u516d\u65b9\u787c\u6c2e\u5316\u7269\uff08hBN\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u8868\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u5143\u4ef6\u96c6\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u6fc0\u5149\u5199\u5165\u548c\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81hBN\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7d2b\u5916\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u5bf9hBN\u8868\u9762\u7f3a\u9677\u8fdb\u884c\u8f90\u7167\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u70ed\u5faa\u73af\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0hBN\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u7f3a\u9677\u5728\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u81f3\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5149\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5149\u9a71\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u6392\u3001\u80fd\u9699\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6c38\u4e45\u6027Quenching\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u6fc0\u5149\u5199\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "hBN\u8868\u5f81\u5c42\u7f3a\u9677\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5149\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u548c\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7a7a\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u6b21\u7ea7\u6e90\u5e72\u6d89\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u57fa\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u975e\u96f6\u591a\u6781\u77e9\u7279\u5f81\u4ecd\u7136\u5f97\u5230\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u53d7\u5230\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u8272\u6563\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6b21\u7ea7\u6e90\u5e72\u6d89\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u7a7a\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u6781\u5316\u548c\u901a\u7528\u8272\u6563\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u7a7a\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c10\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6e90\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u6548\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6e90\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u54ea\u4e9b\u591a\u6781\u77e9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u4fee\u6539\u5f15\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u4e2a\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66 realized Universe\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u533a\u5206\u4fee\u6539\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u3002"}}

Recently, Coulomb explosion imaging has emerged as a promising technique for imaging the evolving structure of individual molecules in the gas phase. However, its practical application for structure determination is hampered by the lack of suitable algorithms to directly retrieve the molecular structure from the measured fragment-ion momentum data. Here, we propose a scheme to solve the underlying inverse problem by employing neural networks to infer the initial atomic positions from the final ion momenta on an event-by-event basis. Using this scheme, we retrieve the structure of several polyhalomethane isomers from simulated Coulomb explosion imaging data with an average per-atom position error of approximately 0.1 atomic units, i.e., to within 5% of the typical bond lengths. This development paves the way for an automated structure retrieval from Coulomb explosion data one molecule at a time, making it ideally suitable for analyzing pump-probe experiments where several products are formed that need to be distinguished.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, these links are more vulnerable to cross-modal coupling that significantly impacts their overall performance. This study presents a technique aimed at minimizing the coupling of energy into higher-order modes within weakly coupled rectangular dielectric waveguides that are excited by a linear taper. The approach involves wrapping the waveguide with a material of a higher dielectric constant than both the core and the cladding of the waveguide. The added material significantly improves the modal confinement factor of the fundamental mode to the core, leading to a much smaller coupling to the parasitic higher-order cladding modes. The new waveguide with the additional material cladding is analyzed, and semi-analytical approximate expressions are derived to predict the mode profiles and cutoffs. Design equations are given to choose the thickness of the wrapping material. The waveguide is fabricated and compared against a similar cross-section waveguide without the additional wrapping material. Unlike the unwrapped waveguide, the group delay (GD) results of the proposed (wrapped) waveguide closely match the EM-simulated GD of the fundamental mode, confirming the significant isolation of higher-order modes. The measured GD of the proposed DWG is 50 ps/m, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 35 ps/m.

In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models.

This requires continuous top-up injection and operation with a two-bunch injection scheme, injecting two 96 ns spaced bunches in a single injection cycle. An important input for tuning the injection beam is the position reading from a dedicated beam position monitor (BPM), located after the septum magnets, slightly upstream of where the injected and stored beams converge. Previously, the readout electronics used for these special BPMs were not capable of independent measurement of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode and modification of the concerned devices and their firmware was not feasible. The opportunity was taken to develop a new readout device based on the AMD/Xilinx RF System on a Chip (RFSoC) platform with the goal of not only providing a sufficiently flexible and performant readout solution for the concerned BPMs, but also to evaluate and gain experience with the platform for beam monitor electronics applications.

Free-space propagation and objective-lens aberrations are implemented via two-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs) and diagonal phase operators in reciprocal space, while specimen interaction is modeled under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA) as a position-dependent phase grating. We validate projected potentials, contrast transfer function (CTF) behavior, and image contrast trends against classical multislice simulations for MoS$_2$ over experimentally relevant parameters, and provide resource estimates and key assumptions that determine end-to-end runtime. While extracting complete $N\\times N$ intensity images requires $O(N^2/\u03b5^2)$ measurements that preclude advantage for full-image reconstruction, the framework enables quantum advantage for tasks requiring Fourier-space queries, global image statistics, or phase-coherent observables inaccessible to classical intensity-only detection.

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $\u03bd=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By cyclically coupling three hyperfine spin states via Raman and microwave fields, we impose a periodic boundary condition in the synthetic dimension, which together with a real-space ring trap, realizes a toroidal geometry with a synthetic magnetic flux. This flux induces azimuthal density modulations in the condensate, whose periodicity is uniquely determined by the quantized toroidal magnetic flux-a hallmark of the Hall torus geometry. By varying the relative phase between the couplings across repeated experimental runs, we control the location of the density extrema, emulating the behavior of Thouless charge pump in a toroidal geometry. We further investigate the onset of these modulations as the system transitions from a cylindrical to a toroidal topology. Our results establish a versatile platform for investigating quantum Hall physics and topological phenomena in synthetic curved spaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

By leveraging intracavity dispersion management and a Lyot filtering mechanism, the laser achieves flat-top optical spectra with 10-dB bandwidths exceeding 20 nm in both directions. Single-pulse energies of 2.7 nJ and 1.5 nJ are achieved for the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. Furthermore, the all-fiber configuration exhibits superior noise performance and inherent common-mode noise suppression. To facilitate broadband and high-speed dual-comb spectroscopy, we employ a dynamic repetition rate difference control technique via pump power modulation, enabling zero-crossing dynamic scanning. This approach achieves a spectral measurement bandwidth of approximately 16 nm at an acquisition rate of 500 Hz. Compared to static operation, this represents a nearly two-order-of-magnitude improvement in acquisition speed and achieves a fivefold measurement bandwidth beyond the Nyquist aliasing limit. Experimental results demonstrate that the system maintains robust coherence even under dynamic modulation. By implementing a phase-correction algorithm, a mutual coherence time of 0.5 s is successfully achieved, yielding a spectral resolution exceeding 7.2 GHz.

Model parameters are rigorously constrained using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis with the help of Bayesian statistics and incorporating late-time observations from BAO and Patheon+SH0ES. The investigation of dynamical parameters such as the equation of state parameter and cosmological parameters indicates alignment with an accelerated expansion phase in both the present and late time epochs. Validation is conducted by assessing the energy conditions, verifying the feasibility of the model forms with particular emphasis on the violation of the strong energy condition that indicates dark energy dominance in modified gravity scenarios. This investigation has been instrumental in determining models that remain consistent with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements. The reconstructed forms of the model effectively mimic $\u039b$CDM at late times, providing significant insights into possible extensions of general relativity and bolstering $f(T)$ gravity theory as a robust explanation for cosmic acceleration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Starting from the Dirac equation and using controlled spinless and paraxial approximations, we show that the transverse envelope obeys an effective nonstationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation governed by a Caldirola--Kanai Hamiltonian. The longitudinal energy gain or loss encoded in $f(z)=[E_0-V(z)]^2-m^2$ generates an effective gain or damping rate $\\widetilde\u03b3(z)=\\partial_z f(z)/[2f(z)]$ and a $z$-dependent oscillator frequency $\\widetilde\u03c9(z)=p_0\u03a9(z)/\\sqrt{f(z)}$. Exploiting the Ermakov mapping (unitary equivalence of Caldirola--Kanai systems), we obtain a closed-form propagated twisted wave function by transforming the stationary Landau basis. The transverse evolution is controlled by a single scaling function $b(z)$ that satisfies a generalized Ermakov--Pinney equation with coefficients determined by $E_z(z)$ and $B_z(z)$.

While quantum algorithms for the standard DFT are well established, a corresponding framework for the non-uniform case remains underdeveloped. This work introduces a quantum algorithm for the Non-Uniform Quantum Fourier Transform (NUQFT) based on a low-rank factorization of the NUDFT matrix. The factorization is translated into an explicit quantum construction using block encodings, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Linear Combination of Unitaries framework, yielding an $\u03b5$-accurate block encoding of the NUDFT matrix with controlled approximation error from both classical truncation and quantum implementation. Under standard oracle access assumptions for non-uniform sampling points, we derive explicit, non-asymptotic gate-level resource estimates. The resulting complexity scales polylogarithmically with target precision, quadratically with the number of qubits through the quantum Fourier transform, and logarithmically with a geometry-dependent conditioning parameter induced by the non-uniform grid. This establishes a concrete and resource-efficient quantum analogue of the NUDFT and provides a foundation for quantum algorithms on irregularly sampled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u975e\u5747\u5300\u79bb\u6563\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\uff08QNUDFT\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728Polylog\u03b5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002QNUDFT\u7684\u63d0\u51fa\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9NUDFT\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4e8e\u5355\u5143ary\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86QNUDFT\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728Polylog\u03b5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0NUDFT\u7684\u03b5\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6oracle\u8bbf\u95ee\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u95e8\u8def\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To expand the energy scales and types of systems that can be studied, frequency comb sources from terahertz to vacuum ultraviolet frequencies and beyond have been pursued. Dual-comb spectroscopy, enabled by the development of these frequency comb sources, allows broadband absorption measurements of complicated spectra, exceeding the limitations of direct, single-comb spectroscopy. To date, however, the dual-comb approach has not been able to directly access many important transitions that lie at challenging vacuum ultraviolet wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate dual-comb spectroscopy in the vacuum ultraviolet utilizing intracavity high harmonic generation. This multi-harmonic source is used to measure molecular absorbance spectra at $\u03bb=210$~nm and $\u03bb=149$~nm from room-temperature samples of acetylene and ammonia, respectively. These measurements resolve the Doppler broadened structure of congested molecular spectra with absolute frequency accuracy.

There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the \"holes\" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency.

Solving ILPs is \\textsf{NP-Hard} yet of great practical importance. Super-quadratic quantum speedups for ILPs have been difficult to obtain because classical algorithms for many-constraint ILPs are global and exhaustive, whereas quantum frameworks that offer super-quadratic speedup exploit local structure of the objective and feasible set. We address this via quantum algorithms for Gomory's group relaxation. The group relaxation of an ILP is obtained by dropping nonnegativity on variables that are positive in the optimal solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation, while retaining integrality of the decision variables. We present a competitive feasibility-preserving classical local-search algorithm for the group relaxation, and a corresponding quantum algorithm that, under reasonable technical conditions, achieves a super-quadratic speedup. When the group relaxation satisfies a nondegeneracy condition analogous to, but stronger than, LP non-degeneracy, our approach yields the optimal solution to the original ILP. Otherwise, the group relaxation tightens bounds on the optimal objective value of the ILP, and can improve downstream branch-and-cut by reducing the integrality gap; we numerically observe this on several practically relevant ILPs. To achieve these results, we derive efficiently constructible constraint-preserving mixers for the group relaxation with favorable spectral properties, which are of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Here, we study nontrivial interplays between non-Fermi liquid behaviors emerging from strong correlation and non-Hermiticity arising from open systems. We propose a practical physical setup that realizes a non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model. We identify a weak-coupling local moment fixed point and a strong-coupling non-Fermi liquid fixed point under PT symmetry, both are enriched by the non-Hermitian effect. Remarkably, universal unconventional Kondo conductance behaviors are found for both cases, which are distinct from all previously studied Kondo systems. Particularly, we show that an anomalous upturn of conductance could take place with increasing the temperature, originating from the interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity.

While deposited metal films offer excellent scalability for nanodevices, achieving ballistic transport in these films poses a challenge due to their short electronic mean free path.

While deep learning has improved parameter optimization, it has yet to address the fundamental challenge of conceptualizing valid optical architectures from functional requirements. Here, we present an end-to-end generative framework that couples the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a differentiable ray-tracing engine to democratize the synthesis of diffraction-limited optical prescriptions. By treating optical design as a semantic-to-physical translation task, the system autonomously interprets prompts ranging from high-level end-user requests to rigorous technical specifications. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across three distinct regimes: (1) finite-conjugate industrial metrology systems, where the model autonomously enforces application-specific constraints such as telecentricity to achieve diffraction-limited performance; (2) a suite of infrared objectives (NIR, SWIR, and LWIR), demonstrating the framework's ability to synthesize valid topologies and optical prescriptions for non-visible spectral bands, and (3) complex aspheric mobile lenses, where the system successfully navigates the high-dimensional optimization landscape to produce high-resolution designs suitable for modern sensors. Validated against industry-standard simulation tools, these results establish a new paradigm for automated optical engineering, bridging the gap between semantic intent and physical realization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u529f\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5171\u8f6d\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u548c\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7403\u9762\u79fb\u52a8\u955c\u5934\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6bd4\u8d77\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u56fe\u50cf\u786c\u4ef6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8 Performance \u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u77ed\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u53d1\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5df2\u7136\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u6307\u5bfc\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u4e4b\u8c1c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u9700\u6c42\u6216\u6280\u672f\u89c4\u8303\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff1a\u6709\u9650\u5171\u8f6d\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u548c\u957f\u6ce2\u7ea2\u5916\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7403\u9762\u79fb\u52a8\u955c\u5934\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5730\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5149\u5b66\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u77ed\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region.

We demonstrate this in a spinful Qi-Wu-Zhang model of a two-dimensional Chern insulator coupled to disordered classical spins of unit length. The topological phase diagram is computed numerically using two complementary approaches: twisted boundary conditions and the topological Hamiltonian technique. Our results show that strong disorder can act as a fundamental topological mechanism rather than merely a perturbation. For strong exchange coupling, tuning the mass parameter reveals a transition between phases with different Chern numbers $C$.

We specifically apply this formalism to correlators of giant gravitons in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills to probe the nontrivial physics beyond planarity. By combining this framework with bootstrap techniques, we compute all four-point functions at strong coupling involving two maximal giant gravitons and two supergravitons of arbitrary dimensions. We identify a partially broken, higher-dimensional hidden symmetry -- a defect extension of 10d hidden conformal symmetry -- present at both strong and weak coupling, which allows these correlators to be packaged into a single generating function. Furthermore, we perform a systematic OPE analysis of the strong-coupling correlators, extracting the complete spectrum of anomalous dimensions for the defect-channel double-particle operators. Finally, we argue that the defect perspective provides the natural nonperturbative description for any LLHH correlator by showing that four-point conformal blocks reduce to defect two-point blocks in the heavy limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

In liquids, rapid molecular tumbling averages anisotropic dipolar couplings and leaves effective isotropic scalar $J$-coupling Hamiltonians. At zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) conditions, differences in frequency between nuclear spins of different types are quenched and the internal Hamiltonians can be closely approximated by an isotropic Heisenberg model. In this work, we present [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as a chemically engineered nuclear spin chain whose full spin-spin coupling network can be determined and validated by combining high-field NMR detection with evolution at ultralow fields. Starting from high-field (16.4 T) NMR spectra of $^1$H, $^{13}$C, and $^{15}$N nuclei, we extract all relevant $J$-couplings within a 12-spin network (four $^{13}$C, one $^{15}$N, and seven $^1$H). We then employ a mechanical field-cycling apparatus to prepolarize the spins at high field, shuttle them into a magnetically shielded region for evolution at <50 nT, and detect signals after returning to high field. Fourier analysis of the ultralow-field evolution yields indirect $J$-spectra that are conceptually analogous to ZULF NMR spectra but measured by a high-field NMR spectrometer. We observe clear spectral features at $J$, 1.5$J$, and 2$J$, in good agreement with simulations using the extracted coupling matrix. Finally, we demonstrate 2D experiments that correlate high-field chemical shifts and, thus, fully map interactions within the molecular spin chain.

Eliminating the Kerr nonlinearity is advantageous for quantum-limited amplification, as it mitigates unwanted distortions in squeezing and prevents degradation of both gain and quantum efficiency in the high-gain strong drive regime. By replacing the central junction in the symmetrically threaded SQUIDs (STS) configuration with a linear inductor, we find that the Kerr-nonlinearity can be eliminated and the effective Hamiltonian reduces to that of a degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA), up to higher-order corrections in the zero-point fluctuations of the superconducting phase operator. We show that the deviations from ideal DPA behavior introduced by these higher-order terms are significantly weaker than those associated with a Kerr nonlinearity. Consequently, the STS design can be driven strongly while maintaining near-quantum-limited performance at the Kerr-free point.

Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes.

By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, \u03c6)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\\Box \u03c6)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Ho\u0159ava gravity.

By applying a time-dependent magnetic field, magnons can be excited independently in each mode and subsequently brought into interaction, shifting from independent to collective oscillations, to realize a controllable magnonic beamsplitter.

The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases.

Here, we extend our work to the valence band of tellurene, where the eMChA is usually said to be chiral ($\u03c7\\neq 0, \u03b3= 0$). We show that also a polar coefficient $\u03b3\\neq 0$ emerges naturally through a downfolding procedure, in which remote Weyl-node containing bands induce momentum-space gradients of the quantum metric in the low-energy levels, activating finite metric dipoles. Combining semiclassical Boltzmann transport with a ${\\bf k}\\cdot{\\bf p}$ description of tellurene, our numerical calculations agree quantitatively with doping ($\u03bc$) dependent second-harmonic measurements of the longitudinal voltage $V^{2\u03c9}_\\parallel(\u03bc)$ in perpendicular field. The combined chiral and polar characters ($\u03c7\\neq0, \u03b3\\neq 0)$ of the eMChA in tellurene also explains the shift in the angular ($\u03c6$) dependence of $V^{2\u03c9}_\\parallel(\u03c6)$ for in plane fields. Our results demonstrate that the polar eMChA can arise in topologically trivial bands through multiband effects and establishes tellurene as a platform for quantum-geometric rectification in both electron and hole regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u5e26\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u78c1\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u78c1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u70b9\u4e0b\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u78c1\u6027\u575a\u5f3a\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5e26\u6548\u5e94\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u70b9\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408 semiclassical Boltzmann \u8fd0\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u548c kp \u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u4f4d\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u5e26\u6548\u5e94\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u4e0b\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5e26\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u975e\u96f6\u80fd\u9699\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u8bba\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u786e\u8ba4\u3002"}}

Here, we propose a novel chaotic LiDAR system based on a semiconductor vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) with delayed orthogonal polarization feedback. By exploiting the intrinsic competition between the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the system generates a polarization-multiplexed dynamics: a chaotic TM mode serves as the reference, while a feedback-modulated TE mode probes the target. This all-in-one source eliminates the need for external optical modulators or complex coherent detection. The system's dynamics is finely tunable via a half-wave ($\u03bb$/2) plate in the feedback loop and the laser injection current, enabling real-time optimization of the cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratio. Experimental results demonstrate precise linear ranging with a resolution of approximately 1.2 cm. Furthermore, the system exhibits strong inherent resistance to external optical interference, maintaining accurate ranging even in the presence of a secondary laser source. This compact, tunable, and interference-resilient platform offers a promising pathway toward low-cost, high-performance LiDAR for applications in autonomous navigation, robotics, and industrial metrology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u81f4\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u5782\u76f4\u5149\u53d1\u5c04\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1 lasers (VCSEL) \u7684\u6df7\u6c8c LiDAR \u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u6781\u5316\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u7535\u573a (TE) \u548c\u78c1\u573a (TM) \u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740 LiDAR \u6280\u672f\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684 LiDAR \u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u573a\u81f4\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1 VCSEL \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6b63\u4ea4\u6781\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6a2a\u5411\u6ce2\u957f\u7247\uff08\u03bb/2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4ea4\u53c9\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u7ea6 1.2 cm \u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u6c8c LiDAR \u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Analytic conditions on the subpulse Rabi frequencies and detunings are derived to reproduce the continuous-time population dynamics of a conventional long-pulse excitation. We find that the reproduced dynamics achieves high fidelity even for pulse trains with a small number of subpulses, provided that each subpulse remains within the perturbative regime. The subpulses act as discrete samples of the underlying continuous evolution; consequently, more complex population dynamics, characterized by multiple oscillations prior to the onset of adiabaticity, require a larger number of subpulses for accurate reproduction. In addition, we demonstrate how the sidebands of a frequency comb can be exploited for resonant excitation at large carrier detuning and for the precise preparation of superposition states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u963f\u0434\u0438\u0430\u0431atic \u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u5b50\u8109\u51b2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u7ec4\u6210\u5206\u7684\u65c1\u74e3\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u957f\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u963f\u8fea\u4e9aatic \u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ed\u8109\u51b2\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5b50\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u9ece\u6bd4\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b50\u8109\u51b2\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u8109\u51b2\u90fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u53ef\u8c03\u5236\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u65f6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9891\u7387\u7ec4\u6210\u5206\u7684\u65c1\u74e3\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u957f\u8109\u51b2\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u963f\u8fea\u4e9aatic \u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u5c42Si/SiGe\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u4e2d\u7684\u8c37\u5206\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u591a\u8c37\u5305\u7edc\u51fd\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7126\u70b9\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8c37\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f4d\u52bf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u7845\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7684\u8c37\u5206\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8c03\u63a7\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8c37\u5305\u7edc\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u5408\u8c37\u5206\u89e3\u548cBurt-Foreman\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8c37\u8026\u5408\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\u6c42\u89e3\u3001\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u591a\u8c37\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9ad8Ge\u6d53\u5ea6\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u56e2\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c37\u8026\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u5143\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u7845\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

These indices are protected observables, whose value can be reliably extrapolated from weak to strong coupling, where the gravitational description applies. In this Thesis, after a broad introductory review, we discuss recent progress in formulating such protected observables directly within the gravitational theory, via the Euclidean path integral. In the semiclassical limit the index reduces to a sum over complex Euclidean saddles. These saddles are supersymmetric but ''non-extremal'', and arise in both anti-de Sitter and flat spaces. In the holographic setting, we investigate four-derivative corrections to the thermodynamics of AdS$_5$ black holes. Using off-shell methods, we construct the corrected action of five-dimensional gauged supergravity. We then evaluate the corrected on-shell action of supersymmetric AdS$_5$ black holes and find exact agreement with a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index of the dual conformal field theory. By a Legendre transform of the action, we obtain the corrected black hole entropy, and we confirm this result by applying Wald's formula to the corrected near-horizon geometry. We then turn to the gravitational index with asymptotically flat boundary conditions. We uncover a broad family of novel saddles and present a general classification based on their rod structure, which characterizes their topology. These solutions may feature multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles with lens space topology, and allowing for conical singularities yields further geometries, involving spindles and branched spheres.

Harrington"], "title": "Polarization fringes in optical systems: a compendium", "comment": null, "summary": "Spectral and spatial fringes in polarized light are produced by the interference of transmitted and reflected waves at the interface between materials with different indexes of refraction. These instrumental artifacts can affect the accuracy of optical designs conceived for high-sensitivity spectroscopy and polarimetry. We review the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for these artifacts and the possible design pathways that allow us to mitigate them. In order to do so, we also present an approximate treatment of the problem of the transmission and reflection of light through (possibly absorptive) birefringent layers, relying on a few fundamental results that can be found in the already extensive literature on the subject. Unfortunately, many of these results remain the domain of a niche of investigators working in the field of thin films and optical coatings, and are often overlooked even by experienced designers of spectro-polarimetric instrumentation. The treatment presented in this work is limited to isotropic materials and uniaxial crystals, which are the most common types of optics employed in polarimetric instrumentation, and it fundamentally relies on the approximation of small birefringence for its implementation. An extensive set of modeling examples is provided to highlight the salient characteristics of polarization fringes, as well as to assess how approximate treatments such as this compare to exact but more computational expensive formulations of the problem such as Berreman's calculus.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u6750\u6599\u754c\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6781\u5316\u5149\u5e72\u6d89\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5149\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7b80\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6781\u5316\u5149\u5728\u754c\u9762\u7684\u5e72\u6d89\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u6781\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u8f74\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u5316\u5149\u5e72\u6d89\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c0f\u4e8c\u8f74\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6781\u5316\u5149\u5e72\u6d89\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6781\u5316\u5149\u5e72\u6d89\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6781\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Rather than viewing the SR-CC cluster operator solely as a device for reproducing one target state, we consider more general constructions in which different components of the cluster operator play distinct roles, ranging from encoding states of different symmetry than the reference to enabling SR-CC Ansatz to describe multiple states simultaneously. These developments lead to a new class of SR-CC downfolding formalisms in which the resulting active-space effective Hamiltonians are capable of concurrently representing multiple correlated states nonorthogonal to the reference function. We establish three theorems that formalize this extension and demonstrate that standard CC downfolding emerges as a special case of the proposed framework.

Interfacial thermal resistance constitutes a significant portion of the total thermal resistance. In this study, we report an ultrahigh thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of approximately 800 MW/m2-K at the atomically-sharp AlN-SiC interface, achieved through an ion implantation-enhanced nucleation epitaxy technique. This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes.

Our analysis covers two distinct classes of defects: universal defects, which realize the $\\mathrm{Rep}(S_N)$ non-invertible symmetry, and non-universal defects.\n  We show that the defect relative entropy reduces to a Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence. The resulting expression decomposes naturally into two contributions: one governed by characters of the symmetric group $S_N$, and the other controlled by modular $S$-matrix elements of the seed RCFT. Remarkably, both sets of data appear as probability distributions, yielding an information-theoretic interpretation of permutation group data and modular data within the symmetric orbifold.\n  The structure of the divergence depends sensitively on the defect class. For universal defects, only the permutation group data contributes; for maximally fractional defects, both permutation and modular data enter and together define the relevant probability distributions.

However, existing electro-optical approaches rely on volatile mechanisms that require continuous power consumption. Here, we demonstrate strong, nonvolatile modulation of optical dispersion in monolayer tungsten disulfide (ML WS2) using patterned ferroelectric domains in aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN). By locally poling ferroelectric domains into opposite states, we achieve substantial manipulation of the complex refractive index (Delta n > 0.7, Delta k > 0.4) and excitonic energy shifts (~50 meV) in ML WS2, comparable to previous gate-tuning approaches while eliminating continuous power consumption. We introduce an asymmetric screening model that reveals how ferroelectric polarization induces carrier-density-dependent Coulomb screening, leading to distinct excitonic behaviors between electron- and hole-doped regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate a gate-free lateral p-n homojunction with a rectification ratio of 6e10^3, formed through spatial carrier redistribution.

This configuration is suitable for spatially selective excitation of the system by pulsed optical radiation through the side defect. The dynamics of excitation in the chain is governed by structural disorder, caused by technological variations in the parameters of the QDs themselves and their mutual arrangement. To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse.

Using group-valued holonomies and Lie-algebra--valued dilatons, the bulk theory is shown to be purely topological, with all physical information encoded at the boundary. We analyze admissible discrete boundary conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic symmetry algebras directly at the lattice level, including an affine Kac-Moody symmetry and its Brown-Henneaux reduction to a Virasoro algebra, together with the associated Virasoro-dilaton structure. A precise operator product expansion (OPE) dictionary is established by taking the controlled continuum limit of the discrete Poisson brackets. Beyond asymptotic symmetries, we provide an effective boundary description and a representation-theoretic quantization organized by monodromy sectors. Within this discrete framework, black hole entropy follows from gauge-invariant holonomy data and is expressed in terms of the dilaton Casimir, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking result without invoking a fundamental Schwarzian action.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P_1,P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $\u039b(t)$CDM model predicts that $\u03c9_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $\u03c9_0 = -1$.

Hence, the NV charge state is emerging as a powerful all-optical platform for nanoscale sensing and imaging. Although significant progress has been made in engineering near-surface NV centers in bulk diamond, controlling the NV charge state in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has proven challenging, limiting the sensitivity and reliability of FND-based charge state sensing. Here, we demonstrate reliable, reversible switching between the fluorescent NV$^0$ and non-fluorescent NV$^+$ charge states in sub-30 nm FNDs via surface oxidation and hydrogenation, respectively, for single particles and particle powder. In aqueous electrochemical cells, we demonstrate voltage and ion concentration imaging based on the NV charge state in self-assembled FND layers on transparent substrates. Applied voltages reliably modulate the FND PL with a sensitivity of up to 16 mV Hz$^{-1/2}$. Importantly, FND PL is also modulated by local changes in salt concentration with a sensitivity of up to 1.8% per millimolar NaCl, enabling all-optical imaging of ion concentration gradients at the microscale.

In these proceedings, we discuss the resummation of the certain type of such singularities that share common features with those appearing in the quark flavor-nonsinglet sector of QCD. Our main focus is on the interplay between Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in $\u03b5$ expansion and Gross-Neveu in $1/N$ expansion.

This work aims to identify three types of fiber tissues commonly found in the ECM of gastrointestinal tissue specimens by analyzing their polarization properties. To address decomposition methods' reliance on restrictive hypotheses and inability with an individual polarization-based parameter to determine the nature of a given biological tissue; this study employs Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method to offer greater discriminative power and flexibility.

While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits.

This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations.

We find two distinct gapped solutions, one Mott-like insulating (M-phase) and one proximitized superconducting phase (S-phase), separated by first-order transition with hysteresis. In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $\u03c6=\u03c0$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales.

The mode frequencies and couplings of the system are tuned electrostatically using a DC voltage, which also controls the strength of the interactions. Our theoretical model reproduces the experimentally observed avoided crossing in the absence of an AC drive and generates tunable frequency-comb spectra when a parametric drive is applied. By scanning the DC voltage, we generate a phase diagram that links comb formation and sharp regime boundaries to underlying bifurcations, multi-stability, and attractor switching. Phase-resolved diagnostics based on a Kuramoto order parameter, together with autocorrelation and Poincar\u00e9 analyses, quantify coherence and critical slowing down near these transitions.

To probe the transition, we employ two holographic indicators: holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), the latter being a mixed-state entanglement measure. In contrast to HEE, which for sufficiently large configuration is dominated by the thermal entropy and is therefore largely insensitive to entanglement along the temperature direction, EWCS displays pronounced critical scaling and provides a robust diagnostic of the quantum phase transition (QPT).

However, direct characterization of non-classical light at damage-threshold intensities remains an open question. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of photon-number fluctuations of squeezed light on strong-field photoelectron holography using a quantum-optical strong-field approximation. We identify a mechanism, ponderomotive dephasing, whereby the inherent quantum fluctuations of the driving field dictate the stability of the electron's semiclassical action. While amplitude-squeezed light stabilizes the action to enhance holographic contrast, phase-squeezed light amplifies photon-number noise, causing a rapid collapse of fringe visibility. This quantum-optical sensitivity follows a steep quartic wavelength scaling, rendering mid-infrared drivers uniquely sensitive to the field's underlying quantum nature. Crucially, we show that the collapse of holographic contrast is not a loss of information but a metrological gain. By evaluating the Classical Fisher Information, we identify a \"dark-port\" mechanism in the tunneling tail that enables the estimation of field quadrature noise beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This fundamental trade-off between structural imaging fidelity and statistical sensitivity establishes the framework for Attosecond Quantum Tomography: an in-situ, reference-free protocol to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of intense quantum light.

The emergence of a minimum length scale, dictated by the degree of noncommutativity, induces a behavioral transition in the HSC and establishes a lower bound. In the large noncommutativity regime, the qualitative features of the complexity deviate significantly from the commutative case. The HFS is shown to provide an effective measure of the degree of noncommutativity. Although the HSC generally satisfies strong subadditivity, this property fails abruptly when the subregion size approaches the minimum length scale. At finite temperature, the long-range behavior of the HSC is modified, and its lower bound scales positively with temperature. Furthermore, temperature enhances the sensitivity of the fidelity susceptibility to the degree of noncommutativity. Within the AdS soliton background, a competition between connected and disconnected configurations arises in the HSC, signaling a phase-transition-like behavior.

The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Importantly, despite a detector quantum efficiency of only 0.19% at 1100 nm, robust reconstructions are obtained under low-photon-budget conditions. We further identify advantageous mechanism by which increasing the sample-sensor distance from ~3 to 12 mm improves lateral resolution by twofold under strong scattering. Finally, we demonstrate wide-field, label-free amplitude-phase imaging of uncleared mouse tissues, resolving internal structure in brain and liver slices up to ~250 um and ~60 um, respectively.

However, extending this concept into the quantum regime, particularly at the single-photon level, has remained challenging in photonic platforms. Here, we demonstrate quantum-state initialization and detection of single-photon evolutions within a synthetic frequency lattice by integrating a superconducting qubit with a 16-meter aluminum coaxial cable. A tunable superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)-based modulator is employed to synthesize lattice couplings and artificial gauge fields.

Using Nematic Bond Theory, a diagrammatic self-consistent method, we study the nematostriction that happens when the onset of nematic order in the spin-system drives a concomitant structural phase transition. We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold.

Standard textbook methods rely on solving a $4\\times4$ matrix eigenvalue problem to find the modal fields. While widely used, this approach has a subtle but significant flaw: the final determination of the field amplitudes requires finding the numerical null space of a theoretically singular matrix, an ill-conditioned problem that introduces large relative errors in the small but physically crucial longitudinal field components. In this work, we introduce a fundamentally more robust and efficient semi-analytical method. By starting from the foundational symmetries of the cylindrical waveguide and employing a judicious normalisation of the field amplitudes, we demonstrate that the problem can be analytically reduced to a much simpler $2\\times2$ system. This reformulation yields two decisive advantages: the dispersion relation is obtained numerically from a simple and well-behaved transcendental equation, and more importantly, the modal field amplitudes are subsequently determined \\emph{analytically}. Our approach completely bypasses the numerical null space calculation, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the full vectorial field structure.

However, current investigations of AB caging are mostly restricted to the Abelian gauge field case, and the observation of AB caging under non-Abelian gauge fields in a quantum system still remains elusive. Here, we report experimental realization of tunable synthetic non-Abelian SU(2) gauge fields in a rhombic lattice, engineered within the synthetic dimensions of a vibrating trapped ion with multiple levels. We realize AB caging under both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields and systematically investigate the distinctive transport properties of the non-Abelian case. In particular, we observe typical emergent quantum dynamics unique to non-Abelian AB caging, including initial-state-dependent dynamics, second-order effects, and asymmetric caging behavior.

We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moir\u00e9-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon.

The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\\mathcal{O}(\u03c1^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6458\u8981\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u91d1\u6697separator{s}\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f62\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4Hubble\u5e38\u6570H_0\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u624d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7684H_0\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u6697s\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff08GW\uff09\u6e90\u8fdb\u884cHubble\u5e38\u6570H_0\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u662f\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f62\u5f0f\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e14\u65e0\u7535\u78c1\u4f34\u968f\u7269\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u642d\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e8c\u9ed1\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u4e0eXG\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u65f6\u671f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u89c6\u754c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001 host galaxy\u5173\u8054\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u4e8b\u4ef6H_0\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u8db3\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684H_0\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62 induce\u504f\u79fb\u4ecd\u7136\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548chost galaxy\u6392\u540d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u751a\u81f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u5206\u914d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u91d1\u6697s\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6821\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u540e\u671f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u91d1\u6697s\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f62\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7684H_0\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u91cf\u7ea7\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u91d1\u6697s\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668XG\u7ea7\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u6ce2\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\u9ad8\u65f6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fbe\u6210\u4e9a\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7684H_0\u6d4b\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5fc5\u987b\u65e2\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u53c8\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0d\u65ad\u6539\u8fdb\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u3002"}}

The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Land\u00e9 g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion.

An optical-frequency-comb reference anchors the time--frequency phase space and enforces commuting displacement stabilizers directly at the hardware level, continuously defining the logical subspace. Timing jitter, spectral drift, and phase noise map naturally onto Gaussian displacement errors within this lattice, yielding intrinsic correctability inside a stabilizer cell.

Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference.

To relax this bottleneck, we investigate a six-wave mixing (SWM)-based Rydberg atomic receiver as a wideband radio frequency (RF)-to-optical quantum transducer. Specifically, we develop an explicit baseband input-output model spanning from the probe input to the output light field. Based upon this model, a closed-form 3-dB bandwidth expression is derived to expose its dependence on key optical and RF parameters.

By establishing an explicit geometrical correspondence between local measurements and topological surgery operations on an associated link model i.e. a measurement surgery correspondence, we represent the cluster state as a linear Hopf chain. Within this model, measurements in the computational ($Z$) basis act as topological severance in case of bulk measurements while boundary pruning happens for end measurements of qubits. In contrast, transverse ($X$) basis measurements remove the measured qubit while splicing its neighbours, preserving connectivity through real valued correlations. We show that lateral ($Y$) basis measurements also preserve connectivity but generate intrinsically complex phase factors that are not captured by unframed link models, rendering X and Y measurements topologically indistinguishable at the level of connectivity alone. To resolve this ambiguity, we introduce a framed ribbon representation in which quantum phases are encoded as geometric twists, with chiral $\\pm 90^\\circ} twists corresponding to the phases $\\pm i$. This framing yields a phase-sensitive and outcome resolved topological description of all single qubit measurements on linear cluster states.

We show that this results in the discovery of a new complete set, which is one of the main topics of the present article. Another reason for focusing on the one-body problem is that the theory permits the strong coupling between the system and the environment. In the current research landscape, it is valuable to revisit the one-body problem for open quantum systems, which can be solved accurately for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment couplings. A rigorous understanding of the problem structures in the present approach will be helpful when we tackle problems with many-body interactions. First, we consider potential scattering and directly define the resonant state as an eigenstate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation under the Siegert outgoing boundary condition. We show that the resonant eigenstate can have a complex energy eigenvalue, even though the Hamiltonian is seemingly Hermitian. Second, we introduce the Feshbach formalism, which eliminates the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment and represents its effect as a complex potential. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is explicitly non-Hermitian. By unifying these two ways of defining resonant states, we obtain a new complete set of bases for the scattering problem that contains all discrete eigenstates, including resonant states.

In particular, I approximate an $n$-channel $S$-matrix as a function of the first-channel momentum $q$ by a sum of a rational term and a truncated sinc series for each matrix element. Relativistic kinematics are taken into account through the correct momentum-energy relation, and the necessary minor generalization of Marchenko theory is given.\n  For energies where only a subset of scattering channels is open, the analytic structure of the $S$-matrix is analyzed. I demonstrate that the submatrix corresponding to closed channels, particularly near their thresholds, can be reconstructed from the experimentally accessible submatrix of open channels.The convergence of the proposed method is verified by applying it to data generated from a direct solution of the scattering problem for a known potential, and comparing the reconstructed potential with the original one. Finally, the method is applied to the analysis of $S_{31}$ $\u03c0N$ scattering data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Marchenko\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a-\u901a\u9053\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7406\u9879\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u7ea7\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u591a\u901a\u9053S\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u52a8\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d\u505a\u51fa\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f53\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u5f00\u653e\u65f6\uff0cS\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u901a\u9053\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u6062\u590d\u5173\u95ed\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u95e8\u69db\u503c\u65f6\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u6c42\u89e3\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e$S_{31}$ \u03c0N \u6563\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6838\u7269\u7406\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u7406\u8bba\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u52bf\u3002Marchenko\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a-\u901a\u9053\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u5230\u4e00\u5b9a\u9650\u5236\u3002Rsult: \u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55Marchenko\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f00\u653e\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6062\u590d\u5173\u95ed\u901a\u9053\u7684\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u9879\u548c\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u7ea7\u6570\u5bf9\u591a\u901a\u9053S\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u52a8\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d\u4f5c\u51fa\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f53\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u90e8\u5206\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u9053\u5f00\u653e\u65f6\uff0cS\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5173\u95ed\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6062\u590d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u7531\u5df2\u77e5\u52bf\u76f4\u63a5\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u52a8\u80fd\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u901a\u9053\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u5bf9\u5173\u95ed\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6062\u590d\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9$S_{31}$ \u03c0N \u6563\u5c04\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u51fa\u4e0e\u539f\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Marchenko\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a-\u901a\u9053\u9006\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6f5c\u5728\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u90fd\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Abdel-Aty"], "title": "Quantum entanglement enhanced via dark mode control in molecular optomechanics", "comment": null, "summary": "Quantum entanglement is an interesting resource for modern quantum technologies, where generating multiple quantum entanglement is highly required. However, entanglement engineering between multiple modes is strongly suppressed by dark mode effect. Here, we proposed a scheme based on molecular cavity optomechanical structure that enhances quantum bipartite and tripartite entanglement via dark mode breaking. Our proposal consists of an optical cavity that hosts two molecular ensembles which are coupled through an intermolecular coupling. A vibrational hopping rate $J_m$ captures the intermolecular coupling that is phase modulated via the synthetic gauge field method. The breaking of the dark mode is controlled by tuning both the intermolecular coupling and its modulation phase. By adjusting these parameters in our proposal, we can flexibly switch between the Dark Mode Unbroken (DMU) and the Dark Mode Broken (DMB) regimes. We find that in the dark-mode-unbroken regime, the amount of the generated bipartite and tripartite entanglement is significantly low or is suppressed.

Moreover, the generated entanglement is more resilient against thermal noise in the dark-mode-broken regime compared to the thermal robustness in the unbroken regime.

However, their performance critically depends on the choice of initial parameters, and the limited expressiveness of the QAOA ansatz makes identifying effective initializations both difficult and unscalable. To address this, we propose a framework, Scalable Parameter Initialization for QAOA (SPIQ), that employs a relaxed QAOA ansatz to enable classical search over a set of Clifford-preparable quantum states that yield high-quality solutions. These states serve as superior QAOA initializations, driving rapid convergence while significantly reducing the quantum circuit evaluations needed to reach high-quality solutions and consequently lowering quantum-device cost. We present a scalable, application-agnostic initialization framework that achieves an absolute accuracy improvement of up to 80% over state-of-the-art initialization and reduces initial-state diversity by up to 10,000x across QUBO, PUBO, and PCBO problems spanning tens to hundreds of qubits. We further benchmark its performance on a wide range of problem formulations and instances derived from real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent and scalable improvements.

In this paper, we show its hardness in a very strong sense: we show that the 3-local Hamiltonian problem on $n$ qubits cannot be solved classically in time $O(2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n})$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$ under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH), and cannot be solved quantumly in time $O(2^{(1-\\varepsilon)n/2})$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$ under the Quantum Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (QSETH). These lower bounds give evidence that the currently known classical and quantum algorithms for LH cannot be significantly improved.\n  Furthermore, we are able to demonstrate fine-grained complexity lower bounds for approximating the quantum partition function (QPF) with an arbitrary constant relative error. Approximating QPF with relative error is known to be equivalent to approximately counting the dimension of the solution subspace of $\\mathsf{QMA}$ problems. We show the SETH and QSETH hardness to estimate QPF with constant relative error. We then provide a quantum algorithm that runs in $O(\\sqrt{2^n})$ time for an arbitrary $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ relative error, matching our lower bounds and improving the state-of-the-art algorithm by Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset, and Wocjan (Nature Physics 2022) in the low-temperature regime.\n  To prove our fine-grained lower bounds, we introduce the first size-preserving circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction that encodes the computation of a $T$-time quantum circuit acting on $N$ qubits into a $(d+1)$-local Hamiltonian acting on $N+O(T^{1/d})$ qubits. This improves the standard construction based on the unary clock, which uses $N+O(T)$ qubits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Anonymous quantum sensing keeps it secret by estimating amplitudes of the magnetic fields without disclosing the positions of non-zero magnetic fields. In this paper, we propose an anonymous quantum sensing protocol that is robust against any independent noise in state preparations. To this end, we devise a quantum state verification protocol for a superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states and combine it with the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing. Our verification protocol can decide whether the fidelity between the ideal and actual states is high or low more efficiently than the direct fidelity estimation.

In contrast to standard cavity quantum electrodynamics with its electric-dipole coupling of the electric field operators with matter, here it is the quantized magnetic field of an LC-resonator which is coupled to the angular momentum of particles.

In the absence of adversarial intervention, the protocol enables reliable message recovery, whereas eavesdropping induces characteristic disturbances that disrupt the periodic reconstruction mechanism. We further examine hardware feasibility on contemporary NISQ processors, specifically $ibm\\_torino$, incorporating qubit connectivity and state-transfer constraints into the circuit design. Our analysis demonstrates that communication between spatially separated logical modules increases circuit depth via SWAP operations, leading to cumulative noise effects. By exploring hybrid state-transfer strategies, we show that qubit selection and connectivity play a decisive role in determining fidelity and overall protocol performance, highlighting hardware-dependent trade-offs in NISQ implementations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70(DTQW)\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e15\u5c14\u8bfa dynamics\uff0c\u5229\u7528NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u786c\u4ef6\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Qiskit\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u3001Hellinger fidelity\u3001\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u5e72\u6270\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u6d88\u606f\uff1b\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u654c\u65b9\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u53d7\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709NISQ\u5904\u7406\u5668\u5982ibm_torino\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u53ca\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7ea6\u675f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7535\u8def\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u589e\u52a0\u7535\u8def\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u566a\u58f0\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6742\u4e71\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u53ca\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e92\u60e0\u5ea6\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u534f\u8bae\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408NISQ\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aNISQ\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose an effective and experimentally feasible scheme to significantly enhance the simultaneous quantum estimation of the photon magnon and magnon mechanical coupling strengths in a hybrid cavity magnon mechanical platform. Our approach relies on the assistance of a coherent feedback loop combined with the injection of a coherent driving field. We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed setup within currently available cavity magnon mechanical platforms.

These strategies often rely on characterization of the idling processor, but tomographic recovery of (time-independent) Lindblad dynamics scales exponentially with qubit count. Here, we experimentally benchmark and demonstrate that randomized (\"shadow\") measurements accelerate Lindblad tomography on a superconducting transmon processor. We first implement extensible Lindblad tomography, which estimates Lindblad parameters using a complete tomographic dataset, and use it as a baseline to benchmark a shadow tomography approach, shadow Lindblad tomography. The shadow approach recycles randomized configurations to estimate the same Lindblad parameters using far fewer resources under physically motivated locality assumptions. We experimentally verify these assumptions in our processor by implementing the protocols on one- and three-qubit subsystems; here, shadow Lindblad tomography reproduces extensible Lindblad tomography within uncertainties while using exponentially fewer configurations. Leveraging this efficiency, we apply shadow Lindblad tomography to the full five-qubit processor and recover all single qubit dissipation and two-qubit coupling parameters in 9 hours of acquisition time compared to an estimated 58 hours for extensible Lindblad tomography. Additionally, our shadow implementation is compatible with conventional Gaussian error propagation, avoiding the use of median-of-means estimators.

An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices.

These include projections of bipartite positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices onto the set of PSD matrices with a given marginal, and projections of ensembles of PSD matrices onto the set of PSD decompositions of a given matrix, with important special cases corresponding to projections onto the set of quantum channels (via the Choi isomorphism) and onto the set of measurements. We introduce prior-channel decompositions of completely positive (CP) maps, which uniquely decompose any CP map into a prior PSD matrix and a quantum channel. This decomposition generalizes the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism by establishing a bijective correspondence between arbitrary bipartite PSD matrices and channel-state pairs, and we show that it arises naturally from the fidelity projections developed here. As applications, we show that the pretty good measurement - associated with a weighted ensemble - is the fidelity projection of the ensemble onto the set of measurements, and that the Petz recovery map - associated with a reference state and forward channel - is the projection of a CP map (constructed from the channel-state pair) onto the set of reverse quantum channels, thereby recasting the well-known identification of the Petz map with quantum Bayes' rule in information-geometric terms.

This study investigates how much class information remains accessible under locality-constrained measurements in the presence of noise. The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels. The research identifies an operational breakdown threshold where $k$-local classifiers become indistinguishable from random guessing despite persistent global distinguishability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In particular, we report inter-memristor input-output hysteresis curves exhibiting larger form factors and displaying self-intersecting loops, respectively revealing marked bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Furthermore, numerical simulations show how these features emerge from the interplay between memory depth and relative input phase, for both intra- and inter-memristor input-output relations.

Since heralded entanglement generation attempts succeed only probabilistically, some links will have to be stored in quantum memories at the nodes of the chain while waiting for adjacent links to be generated. The fidelity of these stored links decreases with time due to decoherence, and if they are stored for too long then this can lead to low end-to-end fidelity. Previous work has shown that the end-to-end fidelity can be improved by deterministically discarding links when their ages exceed some cutoff value. Such deterministic cutoff policies provide strict control of the fidelity of all links, but they come at the expense of having to track link ages. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic cutoff policy that does not require tracking link ages, at the cost of abandoning strict control of the fidelity. We benchmark this new probabilistic cutoff policy against a deterministic cutoff policy. We compare the policies in terms of the end-to-end rate and fidelity, and the secret-key rate. We find that even though the probabilistic cutoff policy keeps track of less state, it can provide secret-key rates of the same order of magnitude as the deterministic cutoff policy in chains with few nodes or high elementary link generation probabilities. Moreover, we identify a scenario in which the probabilistic cutoff policy can deliver end-to-end links that are required to have some minimum threshold fidelity at a higher rate than the deterministic cutoff policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "A probabilistic cutoff policy for quantum repeater chains improves end-to-end fidelity and secret-key rates under certain conditions.", "motivation": "Improving quantum repeater efficiency and fidelity is crucial for secure quantum communication networks.", "method": "The study compares a probabilistic cutoff policy with a deterministic one by analyzing end-to-end fidelity, secret-key rates, and achievable rates.", "result": "The probabilistic policy shows comparable performance to the deterministic one in chains with few nodes or high link generation probabilities.

In the context of the SU(1,1) group, sub-Planck features have been constructed through the superposition of four Perelomov coherent states on the hyperbolic plane (the SU(1,1) compass state). However, these structures differ in scale along different phase-space directions, resulting in nonuniform sensitivity enhancement. We overcome this limitation by constructing $\\overline{n}$-component compass states, which are obtained by superposing $\\overline{n} \\geq 6$ SU(1,1) coherent states, with an even total number, evenly arranged along a circular path on the hyperbolic plane; that is, all components lie at the same distance from the origin and have equal angular spacing of $\\frac{2\u03c0}{\\overline{n}}$. These generalized SU(1,1) compass states generate circularly shaped sub-Planck features (isotropic sub-Planckness) and provide uniform enhancement in sensitivity to phase-space displacements.

In open boundary conditions, we show that the LT can be written exactly as the covariance of a bivariate probability distribution built from density-density correlations. This leads to two conceptually distinct extensions to PBC: (i) a geometric one based on the Riemannian center (Frechet mean) on the circle, and (ii) a metric-free one based on the mutual information I, which treats the configuration space purely as a probability space. We then relate the LT to the static structure factor by identifying the diagonal part, Cpp, as a \"localization function\" C(p), whose small-momentum behavior determines the LT in the thermodynamic limit. This clarifies why the LT is sensitive to transitions out of the extended phase but by itself cannot distinguish Anderson-type localization from dimerization: both share the same low-momentum asymptotics. We show that the finite-momentum behavior of C(p), together with an inverse participation ratio (IPR)-based upper bound valid in localized phases, provides a sharp criterion that discriminates localization from dimerization.

In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising hybrid approach. However, standard QAOA implementations utilizing transverse field mixers often fail to strictly enforce hard constraints, necessitating soft penalties that distort the energy landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a constraint-preserving QAOA formulation against Simulated Annealing (SA) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). We implement a specific QAOA ansatz utilizing a Dicke state initialization and an XY-mixer Hamiltonian that strictly preserves the Hamming weight of the solution, ensuring only valid portfolios of size K are explored. Furthermore, we introduce a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule inspired by adiabatic quantum computing to mitigate the \"Barren Plateau\" problem.

We introduce the idea of an instruction-set architecture (ISA) for controller-driven programmability of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center quantum repeater nodes. Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol. We further show that coherent register control enables interferometric diagnostics such as fidelity witnessing and calibration, providing tools unavailable in classical programmability.

However, for large systems, the number of UCC factors leads to deep quantum circuits, which are prohibitive for execution on quantum hardware. To address this, circuit depth can be reduced at the cost of more measurements with a Taylor series expansion of UCC factors with small angles, while treating the large-angle factors exactly. We implement this approach to quadratic order (qUCC) for systems with strong correlations and systems where conventional methods like coupled cluster (CC) with low excitation levels fail, but UCC and qUCC perform well. We study hydrogen chains and the BeH2 molecule that allow us to change the degree of strong correlation due to geometrical distortions. We show, via a dramatic increase in number of factors able to handle exactly, a systematic convergence of these results as more exact UCC factors are included in the calculations -- the hardest to converge regime is in the crossover from weak to strong coupling. In all cases the total number of UCC factors needed to be treated exactly is much less than the total number of UCC factors available (typically about one-third to one-half of the total number of factors).", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces a hybrid approach (qUCC) to reduce quantum circuit depth while maintaining accuracy for systems with strong correlations.", "motivation": "The authors aim to address the limitations of traditional UCC methods in scaling to large quantum systems by reducing circuit depth through hybridization.", "method": "The method involves using Taylor series expansion for UCC factors with small angles, treating large-angle factors exactly.
