Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum frustration.This mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience."}

The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly."}

Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture.

For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry.

We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing.

Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures."}

We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram. This photo-electron-interferometer is a purely experimental scheme and does not rely on any specific theoretical model. It can be extended to a variety of materials, opening up the phase dimension in quantum materials research."}

The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin."}

Vertically aligned 2D materials and their heterostructures provide vdW gap-mediated ion transport in memristor crossbars, providing great potential for high-density integration and reliable RS performance. Nevertheless, the fundamental switching mechanisms and their contributions to the RS remain inadequately understood. In this work, we investigate silver (Ag) filament-based threshold switching (TS) in heterostructures comprising vertically aligned 2D molybdenum disulfide (VAMoS${_2}$) grown via sulfurization and silicon oxide (SiO${_x}$). Compared to SiO${_x}$-only devices, the SiO${_x}$/VAMoS${_2}$ devices exhibit TS with higher on-threshold and hold voltages, each approximately 0.4 V, faster switching times down to 356 ns under a 4 V pulse, and a lower cycle-to-cycle on-current variability of 3.0%. A physics-based, variability-aware model reveals that confined Ag ion migration within the vdW gaps in VAMoS${_2}$ forms ultrathin seed filaments, which guide filament growth in the SiO${_x}$ layer.

Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage."}

Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer length scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has the potential for quantifying local thermal transport with orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution (<100 nm). However, challenges in accurately converting the raw signal to thermal conductivity and accounting for surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption as a characterization standard for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated modulation of thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (Rp) calibration technique that is independent of parasitic heat transport pathways; this calibration enables accurate measurement of the heat dissipated from the SThM probe and the resulting tip temperature change to extract the thermal resistance of the film (Rth). Following calibration, SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited by e-beam evaporation on a SiO2 substrate. Finally, the thermal resistance mapping is converted to thermal conductivity using a finite-element-modeling-based calibration approach, where the average of the pixel-level Rth values yields an effective thermal conductivity of 2.87 +/- 0.18 W m^-1 K^-1, in good agreement with published theoretical frameworks describing heat transport in ultrathin Al."}

Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $μ_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $μ_s'$.

Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $μ_s'$.

Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics."}

Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism,\" has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \\sim L^{-γ}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($ρ\\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($σ(ω) \\sim ω^{γ-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials."}

In an astrophysical environment, $Q$-balls are non-topological solitons that are transparent and only perceived by their gravitational effects. Traditionally, scalar $Q$-balls are modelled with a polynomial potential, but axion-like periodic potentials are also expected to support such solitonic configurations. In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions. We then assess their ability to act as the dark matter halos in galaxies by fitting the observed rotation curves of a sample of disk galaxies from the SPARC catalogue.

Tight integration with the Bluesky control infrastructure at the NSLS-II Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline enables real-time, closed-loop scan orchestration. Applied to a chemically heterogeneous urban PM2.5 sample, X-AutoMap reduced high-resolution acquisition time from over 44 hours to approximately 10 hours by targeting compositionally significant features identified from coarse scans. High-resolution results revealed diverse particle types, including fully mixed, partially overlapping, and spatially distinct multi-element structures, demonstrating the ability of the framework to isolate chemically relevant features with minimal user intervention. The framework supports interactive and autonomous modes, operates within hardware constraints via grid-based scanning, and is robust across varying sample conditions.

Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level.

This work presents a Bayesian inference framework, implemented using Dynamic Nested Sampling, for estimating geometric parameters - such as width and height - of a semiconductor optical waveguide from a single widefield interferogram. The proposed framework reduces the need of leveraging near field scanning microscopy methods for measurements. The notable advantage is that Bayesian statistics not only provide the estimated parameter values but also quantify the uncertainty of the inference results and the fitness of the used model. The proposed full-field, single-shot interferometric approach, supported by Bayesian-based data analysis, achieves high accuracy and sensitivity - down to successful measurement of 8 nm rib waveguide - while remaining resilient to noise. Thus, the demonstrated methodology provides a cost-effective, robust, and scalable tool for semiconductor fabrication monitoring and process verification, as confirmed by both numerical simulations and experimental validation on optical waveguides.

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency."}

Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes."}

Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$."}

However, its mathematical form does not reveal much about the physics behind it. In this paper, we extend RMS Bandwidth to multiple degree-of-freedom, linear, time-invariant, classically damped systems by deriving an Analytical Root Mean Square (ARMS) Bandwidth in terms of a system's modal parameters and initial modal energy distribution. We demonstrate that ARMS Bandwidth reliably and accurately computes a single measure for a practical structure's dissipative capacity. Also, a purely data-driven methodology for assessing the modal energy distribution is developed.

Similar to geometry-dependent plasmon and Mie resonances, these intrinsic material resonances offer coherent and tunable light scattering. Thus far, the impact of the excitons temporal dynamics on the performance of such excitonic metasurfaces remains unexplored. Here, we show how the excitonic decay rates dictate the focusing efficiency of an atomically-thin lens carved directly out of exfoliated monolayer WS2. By isolating the coherent exciton radiation from the incoherent background in the focus of the lens, we obtain a direct measure of the role of exciton radiation in wavefront shaping. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of exciton-phonon scattering by characterizing the focusing efficiency as a function of temperature, demonstrating an increased optical efficiency at cryogenic temperatures. Our results provide valuable insights in the role of excitonic light scattering in 2D nanophotonic devices."}

The method employs the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz and its orbital-optimized variant (ooUCC), both suitable for quantum computing implementations, to evaluate spin-spin coupling constants via qLR. Test calculations on five small molecules are compared with CASCI, CASSCF, and conventional CCSD results. qLR with UCC/ooUCC yields spin-spin coupling constants comparable to classical methods. We further examine the role of orbital optimization and find that ooUCC markedly affects the computed couplings; orbital-optimized results show better agreement with CCSD.

Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present.

The well-known competitive exclusion principle (CEP) states that two species competing for the same resource cannot stably coexist, and more generally, that the number of consumer species is bounded by the number of resource species at steady state. However, the remarkable species diversity observed in natural ecosystems, exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, challenges this principle. Here, we show that interspecific social information use among predators provides a mechanism that fundamentally relaxes the constraints of competitive exclusion. A model of predation dynamics that incorporates interspecific information use naturally explains coexistence beyond the limits imposed by CEP. Our model quantitatively reproduces two classical experiments that contradicts the CEP and captures coexistence patterns documented in natural ecosystems, offering a general mechanism for the maintenance of biodiversity in ecological communities."}

In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better.

The LiNbO3 metasurface enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with angularly dispersed, tunable emission, while the Si metasurface employs a nearly linear optical transfer function (OTF) to differentiate phase and extract phase gradients via spatial quantum correlations. This dual-metasurface enabled combined ghost imaging and all-optical scanning protocols with quantum light achieves phase gradient reconstruction without mechanical tuning. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to resolve phase gradients up to 25 rad/mm with 88% fidelity using a 6x3-pixel proof-of-concept setup.

The architecture combines intramolecular SE(3)-equivariant attention with intermolecular scalar attention, enabling cross-molecular communication without imposing spurious relative geometry.

Solvaformer attains the strongest overall performance among the learned models and approaches a DFT-assisted gradient-boosting baseline, while outperforming an EquiformerV2 ablation and sequence-based alternatives. In addition, token-level attention produces chemically coherent attributions: case studies recover known intra- vs. inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding patterns that govern solubility differences in positional isomers.

While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability."}

By mixing multiple SWCNT chiral structures, the optical response of the absorbing layer was tailored to approximate a theoretical complex refractive index spectrum of dielectrics; therefore enabling high solar absorptance, low infrared emittance, and a low angular dependence with a simple bilayer structure. The fabricated proof-of-concept 1 cm$^2$ absorber exhibited excellent spectral selectivity (solar absorptance/infrared emittance of 0.84/0.03), and an equilibrium temperature of $\\approx 190^\\circ$C ($270^\\circ$C) under nonconcentrated ($2\\times$ concentrated) sunlight, considerably outperformed a blackbody-like absorber. This study presents a high-performance solar absorber with a simple planar structure and proposes a concept of designing dielectric with the desired optical properties by mixing various types of structure-sorted SWCNTs."}

We develop a complete analytical framework for the TMJS's arbitrary $k$-th order photon statistics, identifying a new family of \"squeezing polynomials\" that govern all diagonal and off-diagonal moments. Our central result is that the state's non-Gaussianity is dynamically steerable via an external \"Janus phase.\" This phase acts as a switch, allowing the higher-order coherences ($g^{(k)}$) to be tuned from perfectly thermal (matching the TFD marginal) to deeply sub-Poissonian, a regime marked by strong Wigner negativity. We further establish a physical realization for the TMJS, proposing its generation via coherently superposed Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) trajectories, distinguishing it from the static, observer-dependent Unruh effect.

However, research on the associated Imbert-Fedorov or spin Hall shifts, driven by the spin-orbit interaction of structured light in structured interfaces, has been comparatively scarce and limited. We explore the reflection characteristics of generic polarized, non-paraxial light beams from a corrugated silver (Ag) interface, since surface corrugation can naturally couple the incident radiation modes to the surface excitations. In the vicinity of SPR, we report a significant enhancement in the beam shifts, attributed to the rapid variation of the specular reflection coefficient near its minima, resulting in amplified weak values. By carefully selecting the incident and projected polarization states of the beam, we achieve a pronounced spatial spin Hall effect. We also investigate vortex-induced beam shifts within this resonant regime, revealing distinctive signatures of the angular momentum of the beam. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis is also presented for the conical diffraction geometry, wherein polarization conversions between p and s states are fully incorporated. Our work establishes the interplay of the spin-orbit interaction of light and the weak measurement approach as an important methodology in amplifying SPR effects, which may have important connotations in applications involving light at nanoscales."}

However, extending such moiré engineering to one-dimensional (1D) vdW systems has remained challenging. Here we report the moiré-engineered electronic insulating states in a new 1D moiré superlattice, by crystallographically aligning an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) to 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems. Our work establishes a new and definite moiré engineering route for 1D vdW materials and opens an exciting avenue for exploring interaction-induced quantum phases in 1D."}

In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory."}

However, existing fabrication techniques such as direct electron or laser beam writing on curved substrates, and soft-stamp-based transfer or nanoimprint lithography suffer from limitations in scalability, yield, geometry control, and alignment accuracy. Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems."}

Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results.

Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions."}

We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point."}

Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass.

Here we propose a different route to photonic spacetime crystals based on modulation of the anomalous velocity in low-symmetry conductors, particularly Weyl semimetals. We show that when driven by a strong optical pump, the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons induces an ultrafast spacetime modulation that propagates with a superluminal phase velocity relative to the dielectric background. This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons. These findings identify Weyl semimetals as a promising platform for realizing optical spacetime crystals and open a pathway toward active and nonreciprocal photonic systems governed by quantum geometric effects."}

We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D.

The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $ω_{\\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $Λ$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model.

Remarkably, after further requiring a well-defined collinear limit, we find a unique solution for both MHV and NMHV sectors where all coefficients (e.g. more than $3.1\\times 10^{10}$ for MHV at $L=5$) turn out to be integers. Furthermore, we observe recurrent patterns for coefficients of special words in $E_6$ symbols mirroring those found for the $C_2$ symbol of three-point form factors, which lead to numerous predictions in the form of all-loop sequences. As an initial application, we show that these sequences uniquely fix the MHV symbol through five loops without input from collinear limits. Given the simplicity and surprisingly strong constraining power of both physical constraints and the newly observed sequences, we conjecture that there is a unique symbol satisfying these constraints at any loop order."}

We develop a general theoretical framework and introduce an efficiently computable noise resilience metric that avoids the need for full classical simulation of the quantum algorithm. We illustrate the use of our framework with applications to variational quantum algorithms and analog adiabatic state preparation.

When photon emission rate exceeds cavity losses, nonclassical lasing with sub-Poissonian photon statistics emerges, driven by multi-photon Rabi oscillations. At specific coupling strengths, quantum state trapping effect emerges, producing high-fidelity Fock states at room temperature (e.g. nearly 90%-fidelity of four photon Fock state).

Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics."}

One such anomaly, known as the \"ballooning effect\" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM."}

We develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework that learns corrections mapping PN dynamics and waveforms to their NR counterparts. As a demonstration of the approach, we use the TaylorT4 PN model as the baseline, and train the network on hybridized NR surrogate data (NRHybSur3dq8) to learn higher-order corrections to the orbital dynamics and waveform modes for nonspinning noneccentric systems. Physically motivated loss terms enforce known limits and symmetries, such as vanishing corrections in the Newtonian limit and suppression of odd-$m$ modes in equal-mass systems, promoting consistent and reliable extrapolation beyond the training region. We simultaneously incorporate corrections that account for the different meaning of mass parameters in PN and NR descriptions. The learned corrections significantly reduce the phase and amplitude error through the inspiral up to about $200M$ before the merger.

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings.

The first-order gravitational perturbations backreact with the background metric at second-order, creating a wormhole opening. The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed. For superluminal sound channels, the wormhole opens for an extremely brief duration at late insertion times, rendering it non-traversable."}

Most digital, fault-tolerant approaches use Carleman linearization to map nonlinear systems to linear ones and then apply quantum linear-system solvers. However, provable speedups typically require digital truncation and full fault tolerance, rendering such linearization approaches challenging to implement on current hardware. Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T(\\log L + d r \\log K)\\right)$. The capability of the scheme is demonstrated by using it to simulate the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional Fisher-KPP equation. The resilience of the method to photon loss is shown under strong-dissipation conditions and an analytic counterterm is derived that systematically cancels the dominant, experimentally calibrated noise. This work establishes a continuous-variable framework for simulating nonlinear systems and identifies a viable pathway toward practical quantum speedup on near-term analog hardware."}

Here, we present a scalable fabrication strategy for curved and conformal metasurface optics leveraging thermoforming, an industry-standard, high-throughput manufacturing process widely used for shaping thermoplastics. Our approach uniquely enables wafer-scale production of highly curved metasurface optics, achieving sub-millimeter radii of curvature and micron-level alignment precision. To guide the design and fabrication process, we developed a thermorheological model that accurately predicts and compensates for the large strains induced during thermoforming. This allows for precise control of metasurface geometry and preservation of optical function, yielding devices with diffraction-limited performance. As a demonstration, we implemented an artificial compound eye comprising freeform micro-metalens arrays. Compared to traditional micro-optical counterparts, the device exhibits an expanded field of view, reduced aberrations, and improved uniformity, highlighting the potential of thermoformed metasurfaces for next-generation optical systems."}

Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies.

Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes."}

AlphaTensor-Quantum is a reinforcement learning-based method designed to optimize the T-count of quantum circuits by formulating the problem as a tensor decomposition task.

This self-induced modulation enables unidirectional light transport below the optical gap and, near the epsilon-near-zero point, gives rise to collective parametric resonance and stimulated emission of volume plasmons.

We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates.

For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed."}

Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (<50 $μ$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation.

The wormhole becomes traversable in both the gravitational shear and sound channels within the hydrodynamic approximation. This shows that dynamical metric perturbations can facilitate information transfer in a purely gravitational setting, with the emergence of $G_N$ indicating the gravitational origin. For the shear channel, we consider three different coupling configurations, whereas for the sound channel, we vary both the speed of sound and the attenuation constant, as these parameters control the wormhole traversability. Furthermore, we obtain late-time power-law behavior in the ANEC using fitting function and present a generalization that applies to both shear and sound channels. Due to its propagating nature, the sound channel exhibits late-time power-law remnants at low sound speed similar to the vector diffusive probes, but it prefers an exponential decay at higher sound speed similar to the scalar non-diffusive probes, as the power-law exponent weakened with increasing sound speed.

Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \\sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings. Nevertheless, a detailed numeric analysis reveals that the binary first quantized mapping still requires fewer gates than the binary and unary second quantized ones for realistic combinations of $N$ and $M$, while requiring exponentially fewer qubits than the unary mappings. Additionally, the number of CNOT and $R_z(φ)$ gates necessary to express the exponential of the Hamiltonian in the binary first quantized mapping is comparable to the (overall most efficient) unary first quantized one when $M = 2^n$ for both the Bose-Hubbard model and the harmonic trap with short-range interactions.

This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized systems. An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform.

Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile.

Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes."}

Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings."}

Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions."}

Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\\{\\overline{H}_i, \\overline{H}_i, \\overline{C_i X_j}\\}_{i,j \\in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits.

Unlike existing methods that follow the ``integrate-then-discretize\" paradigm and rely heavily on numerical quadrature, CBMD generalizes Cauchy's residue theorem to matrix-valued functions and directly decomposes a non-Hermitian function into a linear combination of Hermitian ones, which can be implemented efficiently using techniques such as quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). For non-Hermitian dynamics, CBMD achieves optimal query complexity. With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm. For more general dynamics that can be approximated by non-Hermitian polynomials, where algorithms like QSVT face significant difficulties, CBMD remains applicable and avoids the assumptions of diagonalizability as well as the dependence on condition numbers that limit other approaches."}

In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications."}

The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $σ$, and take the limit $σ\\to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $σ> 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\\rm Im}N>0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin."}

Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels.

For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry.

At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error."}

By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory."}

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations."}

An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2.

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations."}

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures."}

Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times.

Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit."}

We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone.

While the renormalization prescription has been thoroughly refined for equilibrium systems, consistently extending it to out-of-equilibrium systems is an active area of research. In this paper, we identify a mutual information-based measure of renormalizability that applies to quantum field theories both in and out of equilibrium. Specifically, we use mutual information to characterize correlations between infinitesimal shells in momentum space and show that the logarithmic derivative of mutual information with mode separation, at large mode separation, is a measure of renormalizability. We first consider Minkowski spacetime, where we introduce dynamics by performing an interaction quench, initializing the field in the free theory vacuum and then turning on the interaction. We show that the late-time mutual information relaxes to that for the interacting vacuum and the logarithmic derivative at large mode separation is negative for super-renormalizable theories, zero for renormalizable (marginal) theories, and positive for non-renormalizable theories. We then consider a conformally-coupled scalar field on the Poincaré patch of de Sitter spacetime, initializing the field in the Bunch-Davies vacuum in the asymptotic past. For different self-interactions and at any finite time, we find that the resulting mutual information has the same qualitative behavior as a function of mode separation, demonstrating that it can be used as a reliable indicator of renormalizability."}

Recently, a new mechanism, termed the ``nodal mechanism,\" has been proposed to induce superdiffusion in quantum models. However, existing realizations of the nodal mechanism have so far been proposed on fine-tuned, artificial Hamiltonians, posing a significant challenge for experimental observation. In this work, we propose a broad class of models for generating superdiffusion potentially realizable in condensed matter systems across different spatial dimensions. A robust nodal structure emerges from the hybridization between the itinerant electrons and the local impurity orbitals, protected by the intrinsic symmetry and topology of the electronic band. We derive a universal scaling law for the conductance, $G \\sim L^{-γ}$, revealing how the exponent is dictated by the dimensionality of the nodal structure ($D_{\\text{node}}$) and its order $n$, and the dimensionality of the system $(D)$ at high temperatures or that of the Fermi surface ($D^F$) at low temperatures. Through numerical simulations, we validate these scaling relations at zero temperature for various models, including those based on graphene and multi-Weyl semimetals, finding excellent agreement between our theory and the computed exponents. Beyond the scaling of conductance, our framework predicts a suite of experimentally verifiable signatures, notably a new mechanism for linear-in-temperature resistivity ($ρ\\sim T$) and a divergent low-frequency optical conductivity ($σ(ω) \\sim ω^{γ-1}$), establishing a practical route to discovering and engineering anomalous transport in quantum materials."}

For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry.

Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes."}

By tuning the impurity density, we achieve precise control over the stability of persistent currents which increases with the impurity number. In the unstable regime, the complex vortex motion within the impurity landscape, characterized by pinning and unpinning events, governs the timescale of the current decay and its final value. Our work establishes atomic superfluids as a pristine platform for exploring universal mechanisms of superflow stabilization and decay, paving the way for atomtronic quantum technologies."}

In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scattering operators between qudits is spanned by a minimal set of three quantum gates. Recoupling relations among quantum gates are shown to follow directly from the crossing properties of the underlying amplitudes and reveal that entanglement generated from separable states in one channel is necessarily intertwined with another. Consequently, we argue any interacting quantum field theory that realizes an $SU(N)$ global symmetry must generate entanglement in at least one scattering channel."}

Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order. This establishes a route to a novel quantum many-body state driven by combinatorial constraints."}

Mains", "Jia-Xin Zhong", "Yun Jing", "Bitan Roy"], "title": "Ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology", "comment": "17 Pages and 12 Figures", "summary": "In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices."}
