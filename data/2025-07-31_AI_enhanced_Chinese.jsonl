We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by\nmeans of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems,\nwe find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states\nusing a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on\nexamining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of\nresidence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with\nthe help of some statistical tests. The effectiveness of these methods is\ndemonstrated on two systems that serve as well-known models exhibiting chaotic\nitinerancy: globally coupled logistic maps (GCM) and mutually coupled Gaussian\nmaps. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number\nof parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics\nobserved previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as the coherent and\nintermittent phases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6d51\u6c8c\u6e38\u8d70\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 want to understand and model complex dynamical systems that exhibit irregular behavior, potentially useful for predicting and managing chaotic systems in real-world applications\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u6362\u71b5\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6d51\u6c8c\u6e38\u8d70\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8fc7\u6e21\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u6790within\u548cbetween\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728Globally Coupled Logistic Maps\u548cMutually Coupled Gaussian Maps\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u6d51\u6c8c\u6e38\u8d70\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6d51\u6c8c\u6e38\u8d70\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Includes work done in\n  collaboration with Jon Pajaud and Poul Jessen", "summary": "In recent decades the field of quantum computation has seen remarkable\ndevelopment. While much progress has been made toward the realization of a\nfully digital, scalable, and fault tolerant quantum computer, there are still\nmany essential challenges to overcome. In the interim, direct emulation of\nquantum systems of interest can fill an important gap not only for exploring\nfundamental questions about many-body physics and the quantum to classical\ntransition, but also for potentially providing alternative methods to verify\nresults from quantum simulations. In this work we will demonstrate a method\nutilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble\nof cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin\nsystem Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are\nable to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to\nexplore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover,\ncontrolling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us\nto investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the\nclassical limit.

Leveraging\nthe photonic matrix core programmability, the processor generates trainable\ncompressive matrices, enabling adjustable image compression ratios (from 2X to\n256X) to meet diverse application needs. Deploying a custom lightweight\nphotonic integrated circuit oriented network (LiPICO-Net) enables high quality\nreconstruction of compressed images.

This work confirms the quantum variational\nalgorithms' capability of describing conical intersections in both molecules,\nas long as appropriate active spaces and geometries of the molecule are chosen.\nWe also compare the accuracy and reliability of VQE-based methods for computing\nexcited states with classical benchmark methods, and we demonstrate good\nagreement within desired regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u7532\u80fa\u548c\u6c34\u5206\u5b50\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e86\u80fd\u5792\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u4e2d\u80fd\u5792\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86VQE\u3001VQD\u3001VQE-AC\u7b49\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SA\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u57fa\u5e95\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5206\u5b50\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u5792\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u53d8\u5206\u7b97\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u80fd\u5792\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Utilising a Fock-Schwinger gauge for both the scattering\nphotons and homogeneous background, simple compact expressions are found for\nboth the photon- and background-dressed effective action and propagator in\nscalar and spinor quantum electrodynamics. The low-energy limit allows\nidentification of the coupling of the scattering photons as one of an effective\nhomogeneous superposition of their field strengths, with amplitudes following\nfrom application of a suitable linearisation operator.\n  To treat the linearisation, several techniques are employed, including a\nfunctional expansion based on the proper time formalism and worldline Green\nfunctions, linearised vertex operators under a worldline path integral, and a\nmatrix expansion in the field strengths. We find, in particular, that a\nreplacement rule converting scalar amplitudes to spinor amplitudes at one-loop\norder can, surprisingly, be extended to tree level amplitudes in the low energy\nlimit. Finally, we discuss a novel worldline representation of the momentum\nspace matter propagators, obtaining a suitable worldline Green function for\nthis path integral satisfying homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and\nmomentum space vertex operators representing the scattering photons already in\nmomentum space.", "AI": {"tldr":

Within\nthe bistable regime of a single Duffing mode driven by radiation pressure\nforces, we observe stochastically generated sidebands, originating from thermal\nfluctuations around equilibrium trajectories in phase space, and exploit these\nsidebands to induce probabilistic transitions between bistable states using\nweak secondary acoustic excitation. Extending this framework to multimodal\ninteractions, we show that nonlinear modes coupling within the same resonator\nleads to similar transitions due to parametric modulation around the\nnoise-excited sidebands as a result of frequency mixing. Simultaneously, abrupt\nchanges in displacements of modes cause their instantaneous energy exchange\nrates to span five orders of magnitude.

The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the\nmHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors.\nHowever, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs\ncould be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze\npotential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance.\nWe use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this\nseries [Silva \\& Hirata, {\\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)]\nand expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for\nmultiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH\nspins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions\nacross a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause\nchanges to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead\nto potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian.\nDetectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could\nbe a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing\naccurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and\npipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various\nperturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing\nmore accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and\ntest theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper examines perturbations in EMRIs caused by third-body interactions, finding that phase changes in gravitational waveforms could be common.", "motivation": "Studying EMRI perturbations to understand galactic centers and test gravity theories.", "method": "Applied formalism from previous work to model perturbations using various SMBH spins and orbit configurations.", "result": "Significant phase changes in waveforms from third-body interactions.", "conclusion": "Modeling needs refinement for accurate EMRI waveform analysis to study galaxies and gravity."}}

The ability to predict and simulate the optical response of 2D\nmaterials heterostructures is thus of high importance, being commonly performed\nuntil now via methods such as the TMM, or Fresnel equations. While straight\nforward, these often yield long and complicated expressions, limiting intuitive\nand simple access to the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the optical\nresponse. In this work, we demonstrate the adaptation of the transmission line\nmodel for VdWHs, based on expressing its constituents by distributed electrical\ncircuit elements described by their admittance. Since the admittance carries\nfundamental physical meaning of the material response to electromagnetic\nfields, the approach results in a system of propagating voltage and current\nwaves, offering a compact and physically intuitive formulation that simplifies\nalgebraic calculations, clarifies the conditions for existence of physical\nsolutions, and provides valuable insight into the fundamental physical\nresponse.

In this context, of special interest is\nentanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because\nit allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The\nresulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection\nefficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing\ndetection and locality loopholes.\n  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of\nentanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted\nphoton. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a\nstate which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay\na photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.\nThis accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the\nemitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.\nBecause these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom\nindistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the\npolarization state of the photon.

The connections between these results are explored through asymptotic analysis.", "result": "The paper demonstrates that in the presence of a magnetic field, the photon sphere and innermost stable circular orbit shift. The innermost photon orbit decreases with a stronger magnetic field. The black hole shadow deviates from the standard Kerr case, with suppression and splitting of the shadow edges under certain inclination angles and field strengths.", "conclusion": "The findings show that magnetic fields significantly alter the standard results of black hole shadows in the Kerr spacetime. The authors provide both analytical and numerical support for their results, suggesting that these effects could be observed in future astrophysical observations, offering new insights into the properties of black hole spacetimes with external fields."}}

In case of\nan $n$-qubit system the disturbance due to depolarization and dephasing is\nidentified based on a certain complexity quantity defined as the difference of\nthe Shannon-entropy and the R\\'enyi entropy of order two. In case of the effect\nof the depolarization the quantum system is replaced by a fully separable, i.e.\nclassical state with probability $p$ while it remains unchanged with\nprobability $1-p$. Whereas dephasing is modelled by destructing the appropriate\noff-diagonal elements of the density matrix also with probability $p$. For both\ncases the state with maximal complexity marks the border between the most\nquantum and most classical limits. Furthermore we also show that many body\nsystems modelled using deformed random matrix ensembles, deformed two-body\nrandom interaction ensembles and also the system of one-dimensional\nHeisenberg-model of spins subject to a random, local magnetic field exhibiting\nmany body localization transition, the states with maximal complexity mark the\ncross-over or the transition point between integrability and full quantum\nchaos. Finally we address the question of identifying the cross-over in the\nthermalization properties within large sets of quantum chaotic states using the\nsurvival probability of an excitation of a many body system. All these results\nshow that the complexity parameter defined on a combination of the von Neumann\nentropy and the R\\'enyi entropy of 2nd order is a meaningful and informative\nparameter to detect whenever a system is in a cross-over state between the\notherwise trivial extremal cases of integrability or localization and quantum\nchaos or ergodic behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u4e8c\u9636R\u00e9nyi\u71b5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u53d8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5f62\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u3001Anderson\u6a21\u578b\u548cHeisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u53d8 especially\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u533a\u5206\u6709\u5e8f\u548c\u65e0\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6d89\u53ca\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u53d8\u5f62\u3001\u76f8\u53d8\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u4e8e\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u76f8\u53d8\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6709\u5e8f\u6781\u9650\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u4f53\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We develop a framework that makes this\nanalogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components\nof perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that\nduality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields\nconstitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the\nassociated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the\ndifference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized\ncomponents of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and\nanti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when\nthe gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We\nthen investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality\nsymmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it\nis anomalously broken in curved backgrounds.

Nonetheless, the lower heating associated with remote\nexcitation enhances the Raman SNR by approximately 30%, improving measurement\nquality without compromising signal strength.

In\nthis paper, we investigate two beamsplitter coatings obtained from Laseroptik\nGmbH and Optoman on a best-effort basis that aim for a 50/50 power splitting\nratio and equal overall phase shift for two orthogonal, linear polarisation\nmodes interacting with the optic.

With these\nstrategies, the Laseroptik coating achieves an equal power reflectivity of 51%\nat 46 deg angle of incidence, and zero phase shift between both polarisations\nat 44.25 deg angle of incidence.

We find that the true measures of different MQCs exhibit\ndistinct hierarchy conditions based on their inherent characteristics.\nAdditionally, the true MQC measures should also satisfy the symmetry for\nsymmetric MQCs. Based on this framework, we verify that multipartite\nentanglement, $k$-entanglement, $k$-partite entanglement, multipartite non-PPT,\nmultipartite coherence, multipartite imaginarity, multipartite multi-mode\nGaussian non-product correlation, multipartite multi-mode Gaussian imaginarity,\nand multipartite single-mode Gaussian coherence are all multipartite quantum\nresources.

Such detailed calculations are uncommon in standard CMB analyses, indicating a methodological innovation in their work.", "result": "The study finds that the correlation function exhibits significant anti-correlation in both angular and redshift variables. In terms of angle, the anti-correlation reaches a relative magnitude of about 20% compared to the central maximum, while in redshift, the anti-correlation is about 50%. This suggests that the spatial and redshift-wise distribution of the emitting regions leads to these anti-correlation features, providing specific quantitative insights into the structure of gravitational wave sources and their impact on the CMB. The results highlight the importance of considering finite emission regions when analyzing inflationary signals, offering a more precise understanding of these cosmological processes.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that the inclusion of an infrared cutoff and finite emission regions can lead to observable anti-correlation in the CMB temperature fluctuations. This challenges previous assumptions about the uniformity of large-angle and redshift-wise correlations in the CMB. The findings suggest that models of inflation with gravitational waves should account for such anti-correlations when interpreting CMB data. This work contributes to refining theoretical models and constraining parameter spaces in inflationary cosmology, potentially aiding in distinguishing between different inflationary scenarios that predict varying gravitational wave signatures."}}

Overcoming the resource constraints set by\nindirect measurement schemes like the Hadamard test, we showcase a direct\nmeasurement scheme that utilizes non-unitary operations, in particular\nmid-circuit measurements, to investigate spin transport for the 40-site 1D XXZ\nHeisenberg model in the near-ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes.\nWe successfully reproduce the expected power-law behavior in the superdiffusive\nregime and vanishing of the Drude weight in the diffusive regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u57fa\u5e95\u7684Transmon\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e861D XXZ Heisenberg\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u8fd0\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u57fa\u5e95\u7684Transmon\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u5355\u5143\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u975e\u5355\u4f4d\u5143\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8f93\u8fd0\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u8fd0\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u65e0\u8272\u8017\u6563\u3001\u8d85\u8272\u6563\u548c\u8272\u6563\u72b6\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u8272\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e42\u5f8b\u884c\u4e3a\u548cDrude\u6743\u91cd\u6d88\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u6d41\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f93\u8fd0\u73b0\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
