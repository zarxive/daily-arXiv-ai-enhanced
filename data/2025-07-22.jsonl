To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald\nSummation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization,\nand Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force\ntraining data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with\nany short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as\nMACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct\nsystems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on\ndefective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct\nelectrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large\nand chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing\nmolecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic\nsystems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its\nshort-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts\ndipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids.

In particular, the results provide evidence that the\nobserved systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is\ndecreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic\nphases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall\nlevel of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for\nthe global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto\nparameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across\nshells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially\nphase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy\nflux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a\nparticular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence\ncorrelates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios\nare considered using two different shell models including a non local helical\nshell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law,\nit was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain\nthe inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic\nphases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of\nthe flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \\pi/2 and -\\pi/2 maximizes the\nforward and the inverse energy cascades respectively."}

This work aims to explore physical mechanisms -- beyond DNA\nrepair inhibition -- that contribute to this synergy.\n  Approach: We developed a biophysical model for the thermal enhancement ratio\n(TER), incorporating temperature-dependent variations in the number of\nvulnerable DNA sites, the DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section, and other\nphysicochemical parameters. These include ion production rate, diffusion\nprocesses, and medium density.

In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound\nstates in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the\nemitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary\nconditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a\nphoton is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the\nemitters.

This type of non-Hermitian response can be\nengineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and\nis rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature\ndipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular\ncircular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative\nmedium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and\ngain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred\ndirection parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding\nelectromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force\ncan be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall\ncurrent. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the\nresulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional\ncurrent-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation\ncharacteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking.

We further explore the possibility of constructing\nlattice-independent GZ scars in higher-dimensional uniform spin-exchange\nsystems with centrosymmetry, using graphical rules developed for GZ scar\nconstruction. Our results indicate that lattice-independent GZ scars cannot be\nsupported on uniform lattices with odd coordination numbers or plaquettes with\nan odd number of edges, while uniform lattices featuring even coordination\nnumbers and even-edged plaquettes can host such lattice-independent scars in\nspecific scenarios.

The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular\ncircular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative\nmedium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and\ngain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred\ndirection parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding\nelectromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces.

Rota understood the category-theoretic\nduality between subsets and partitions which implied there should be a logic of\npartitions dual to the usual Boolean logic of subsets.And just as probability\nstarts quantitatively with the size of a subset, so he saw that information\nshould start with some notion of size of a partition. After developing the\nlogic of partitions and its quantitative version as logical entropy, it became\nclear that there is a fundamental duality, fully developed only in category\ntheory, that runs through the exact sciences. Classical physics lies on the\nsubset side and quantum physics on the partition side of the duality. The rest\nof the paper develops the treatment of quantum mechanics seen through the lens\nof partitions as the logic of definiteness and indefiniteness. The lattices of\npartitions allows the treatment of quantum phenomena in highly simplified but\nessential terms. Since Feynman saw the``only mystery'' of quantum mechanics in\nthe two-slit experiment, this new approach is developed to show how to resolve\nthat mystery. Finally, quantum statistics is treated using Rota-style\nenumerative combinatorics."}

Recent advances in collisional\nshielding, protecting molecules from inelastic losses, have enabled the\ncreation of degenerate Fermi gases and, more recently, Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of dipolar molecules. However, the observation of quantum phases\nin ultracold molecular gases that are driven by dipole-dipole interactions has\nso far remained elusive. In this work, we report the formation of self-bound\ndroplets and droplet arrays in an ultracold gas of strongly dipolar\nsodium-cesium molecules. Starting from a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC), microwave dressing fields are used to induce dipole-dipole interactions\nwith controllable strength and anisotropy. By varying the speed at which\ninteractions are induced, covering a dynamic range of four orders of magnitude,\nwe prepare droplets under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, observing\na transition from robust one-dimensional (1D) arrays to fluctuating\ntwo-dimensional (2D) structures. The droplets exhibit densities up to 100 times\nhigher than the initial BEC, reaching the strongly interacting regime, and\nsuggesting the possibility of a quantum-liquid or crystalline state. This work\nestablishes ultracold molecules as a system for the exploration of strongly\ndipolar quantum matter and opens the door to the realization of self-organized\ncrystal phases and dipolar spin liquids in optical lattices."}

In holographic settings, it admits a geometric\ninterpretation as the deviation between entanglement wedge cross-sections and\nRT surfaces. Motivated by this holographic perspective, we propose a\ngeneralization of the Markov gap to multipartite systems by using a reflected\nmulti-entropy. The resulting Multipartite Markov gap can capture geometric\nobstructions to bulk reconstruction. We investigate the properties of this\nquantity from both information-theoretic and holographic viewpoints, and\nexamine its potential operational significance through candidate recovery maps.\nWe further introduce the genuine reflected multi-entropy, which is designed to\nvanish for states containing only lower-partite entanglement. Together, these\nquantities offer complementary probes of recoverability and multipartite\nstructure in holographic quantum systems."}

Unlike traditional\ndesigns that require separate collimation and refocusing stages, our approach\ndirectly converges imaged light to the back focal plane using a single lens\ngroup. Our configuration corrects spherical aberrations and efficiently\ncollects light to achieve diffraction-limited performance across a wide range\nof wavelengths while simplifying alignment and assembly. Using this approach,\nwe design and construct an example objective lens that features a long front\nworking distance of 61 mm and a clipped NA of 0.30 (limited by an aperture in\nour experimental setup). We experimentally verify that it achieves\nmonochromatic diffraction-limited resolution at wavelengths from 375 nm to 866\nnm without requiring replacement of the lenses or changing the inter-lens\nspacings, and its performance remains robust across a 46 mm range variation in\ntotal length (by adjusting mainly the back working distances). Additionally, we\ndevelop a quantitative method to measure the field of view (FOV) using an\nexperimentally-calibrated pinhole target. Under 397 nm illumination (i.e. from\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion fluorescence), the objective achieves a resolution of 0.87\n$\\mu$m with a 540 $\\mu$m FOV. This robust, all-COTS, and versatile design is\nwell-suited for a broad range of experiments, supporting high-precision\nmeasurements and exploring quantum phenomena."}
