Although MoBI can be performed in a single shot, multiple exposures are typically needed to improve the quality of the result. The membrane is typically moved using a regular stepping pattern for convenience; however, the impact of the membrane movement scheme on image quality has not been fully investigated yet. In this work, we explore optimized movement strategies aiming at improving MoBI performance. An experimental study tested optimization schemes based on global and local standard deviation metrics, and compared them with regular and random stepping motions. The results demonstrated superior contrast-to-noise ratio and reduced angular sensitivity in the optimized approaches compared to conventional stepping. These results were consistent across different membrane types, with honeycomb membranes showing the highest compatibility with the optimization procedure.

Multi-layer metasurfaces (MLM) offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for efficient light manipulation beyond conventional single-material metasurfaces, enabling dual-resonance cavities that can simultaneously enhance pump excitation and SPE collection. However, traditional trial-and-error and forward optimization methods face significant challenges in designing these complex structures due to the vast parameter space and computational demands. Here, we present NanoPhotoNet-Inverse, an artificial intelligence-driven inverse design framework based on a hybrid deep neural network architecture. This model efficiently performs inverse design of two dual-resonance MLM cavities to amplify pump and SPE emissions of different vacancies in nanodiamond and improve SPE collection. Our approach achieves inverse design prediction efficiency exceeding 98.7%, demonstrating three orders of magnitude amplification in SPE count rate and 50 picosecond lifetime, significantly surpassing conventional cavity designs. These remarkable enhancements in emission rates and collection efficiency position our platform as a transformative technology for advancing quantum communication networks, quantum computing architectures, quantum sensing applications, and quantum cryptography systems.

Here, we report a broadband, high responsivity 2D and 1D photodetector formed by integrating monolayer p type WSe2 with electrospun p type NiO nanowires. The device photoresponse spans 350 to 780 nm and is governed by a nanophotonic field confinement mechanism rather than bulk optical absorption. The high index NiO nanowire acts as a dielectric Mie type nanoresonator that supports geometry defined optical modes and produces antenna like near field concentration at the nanoscale WSe2 and NiO junction. This localized optical mode increases the local absorption cross section and enhances the photocarrier generation rate within the junction region, identified as the dominant active volume for photocurrent. A coupled optoelectronic model linking full wave electromagnetic simulations to carrier generation, recombination, and extraction accurately captures the measured responsivity spectrum and its power dependence using only two electronic fitting parameters. The device achieves responsivities of 627 A/W in the visible region, 227 A/W in the UV, and 167 A/W in the NIR, demonstrating broadband operation with ultrahigh gain.

Konik"], "title": "Breakdown of Quantum Chaos in the Staggered-Field XXZ Chain: Confinement and Meson Formation", "comment": "20 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Confinement of fractionalized excitations can strongly restructure many-body spectra. We investigate this phenomenon in the gapped spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain subject to a staggered field, where spinons bind into domain-wall ``mesons'' deep in the antiferromagnetic phase. We present evidence that this non-integrable model exhibits both Hilbert space fractionalization and quantum scar formation as controlled by the anisotropy parameter $\u0394$. Exact diagonalization across symmetry-resolved sectors reveals a crossover from Gaussian-orthogonal (chaotic) level statistics at weak anisotropy $\u0394\\sim 1$ to non-ergodic behavior deep in the antiferromagnetic regime $\u0394\\gg 1$ through scrutinizing the adjacent gap ratios, accompanied by a striking banding of eigenstates by domain-wall number in correlation and entanglement measures. The Page-like entanglement dome characteristic of chaotic spectra gives way to suppressed, band-resolved entanglement consistent with emergent quasi-conservation of domain walls. To investigate further the formation mechanism of mesonic scar states, we carry out meson spectroscopy near the two-spinon threshold and compare with the analytic ladder predicted by Rutkevich [Phys. Rev. B 106, 134405 (2022)]. We test the theory through continuum-relative bindings, an offset-removed Airy scaling collapse, and explicit two-meson thresholds that determine the number of stable meson levels. The low-lying spectrum shows close quantitative agreement, while deviations at higher energies are consistent with finite-size and subleading corrections. These results establish a unified account of confinement-induced nonergodicity and provide a template for quantitative meson spectroscopy in quantum spin chains.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses how confinement of fractionalized excitations, such as spinons, in the gapped spin-\u00bd XXZ chain under a staggered field leads to confinement-induced nonergodicity. Eigenstate thermalization is suppressed, and mesonic bound states form in a controlled manner across the system's parameter space. The study combines exact diagonalization, analytical methods, and numerical comparisons to elucidate confinement mechanisms and their implications for quantum spin chains.", "motivation": "This research is driven by the question of how confinement of fractional excitations affects many-body quantum systems. The understanding of such phenomena not only contributes to fundamental knowledge of condensed matter and high-energy physics but also impacts the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the context of quantum computing and information processing where nonergodic behavior can be harnessed for specific tasks.", "method": "The authors employ an exact diagonalization technique focusing on symmetry-resolved sectors. They use this method in conjunction with analytical tools, particularly the predicted analytic ladder by Rutkevich, to explore the formation and behavior of mesonic bound states. Cross-sectional analysis of gap ratios, entanglement measures, and state banding across different anisotropy parameters serves as a comprehensive approach to understanding the system's dynamics.", "result": "The study identifies a phase transition in the system's behavior based on the anisotropy parameter \u0394. At weak \u0394 (\u0394 \u2248 1), the system exhibits chaotic, Gaussian-orthogonal level statistics, indicating high ergodicity. As \u0394 increases (\u0394 \u226b 1), the system transitions to a non-ergodic regime characterized by domain-wall-resolved Hilbert space structure and distinctive banding in eigenstates. The Page-like entanglement structure typical of chaotic systems is replaced by suppressed, band-resolved entanglement, reflecting quasi-conservation of domain walls. Additionally, precise agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical simulations of mesonic bound state formation is observed, validating the confinement hypothesis.", "conclusion": "This research provides a unified framework for understanding confinement-induced nonergodicity and its role in controlling the spectral and entanglement properties of quantum spin chains. The findings offer a systematic approach to meson spectroscopy, advancing our understanding of fractionalization and confinement in low-dimensional quantum systems and providing a concrete model for future studies in this field."}}

Here we firstly introduce the projections of the mixed pseudo-differential operators to rewrite the 2-BKP Lax equation in the Shiota construction, where the scalar Lax operators involving two differential operators $\\partial_1$ and $\\partial_2$ are used. Based upon this, the $(M_1,M_2)$-reduction of the 2-BKP hierarchy is given. After that, we give the most important result of this paper, i.e., the transformations of the 2-BKP tau functions, which are in fact the 2-BKP Darboux transformations. Here we further give the corresponding changes in the 2-BKP Lax operators. Also the corresponding results are investigated for the reduction case. Finally, the additional symmetries can be viewed as the special cases of the transformations of the 2-BKP tau functions.

These properties are essential for advancing nuclear clock technology and probing fundamental physics. Combining our isotope shift parameters with experimental data, we estimate highly accurate values of the differential nuclear charge radii for $^{232,229}$Th and $^{229m,229}$Th. Additionally, we determine the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments for both the ground and isomeric states of $^{229}$Th by combining measured hyperfine structure constants with our theoretical calculations. Our precise evaluations of electric dipole polarizabilities and hyperfine-induced quadrupole moments are critical for assessing systematic uncertainties in $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$-based nuclear clock. Notably, we observe unexpectedly significant contributions from higher-order relativistic effects and excitations involving orbitals with higher angular momentum, which markedly influence the energies of the ground state and its fine-structure partner. These results highlight the substantial challenges in achieving highly accurate predictions for these properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u3001\u53cc\u548c\u4e09\u91cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u5076\u8054\u805a\u53d8\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u060c\u4f7f\u7528\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u539f\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u6838\u949f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u79fb\u4f4d\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86232\u3001229\u53f7\u80f8\u817a\u7d20\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u6838\u7535\u8377\u534a\u5f84\u7684\u6781\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u503c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u5230\u7684\u53cc fine\u7ed3\u6784\u5e38\u6570\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u80f8\u817a\u7d20229\u53f7\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u7684\u6838\u78c1\u77e9\u53cc\u6781\u77e9\u548c\u53cc\u6001\u7684\u6838\u78c1\u77e9\u53cc\u6781\u77e9\u3002\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7535\u5076\u6781\u6781\u5316\u7387\u548c\u53cc\u6001\u5f15\u8d77\u53cc\u6781\u77e9\u7684\u53cc\u9891\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e229\u53f7\u80f8\u817a\u7d203+\u6838\u949f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u6d89\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u8f68\u9053\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u5bf9\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7ed3\u6784\u53cc\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u949f\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u754c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u5076\u8054\u805a\u53d8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u3001\u53cc\u548c\u4e09\u91cd\u6fc0\u53d1\u5bf9\u80f8\u817a\u7d20\u79bb\u5b50\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u539f\u5b50\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u80f8\u817a\u7d20\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u6838\u7535\u8377\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u6838\u78c1\u77e9\u53cc\u6781\u77e9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e229\u53f7\u80f8\u817a\u7d203+\u6838\u949f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5076\u8054\u805a\u53d8\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6838\u949f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Our method, which relies exclusively on comparing successive range intervals measured by independent local clocks, was applied to data from the GRACE-FO mission. We observe a coherent signal in the derivative of the relative velocity projection, (v_A-v_B) dot V, that exhibits a clear orbital-period modulation. Crucially, the phase and amplitude of this modulation are found to be in excellent agreement across four distinct seasonal datasets, providing strong evidence against a purely random origin.\n  Expressing this observable within the Standard-Model Extension (SME) framework yields an effective velocity magnitude of |V| ~= 139.3 +/- 0.1 km/s. While the corresponding effective SME coefficients (s-bar^0j from 10^-5 to 10^-4) exceed current laboratory bounds, the signal's stability and its coherence with the orbital frame make it a valuable diagnostic for systematic effects in orbital ranging. This work constitutes the first synchronization-free detection of a stable, orbital-scale signal of this type and establishes a clear, experimental path forward: applying this method to other platforms, most critically GNSS, to determine if the signal is a mission-specific systematic or a universal physical effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u536b\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8303\u56f4\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5927\u632f\u5e45\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u79d1\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u540c\u6b65-free\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u536b\u661f\u8f68\u9053\u5668\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u95f4\u9694\u8303\u56f4\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u503c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728SME\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6709\u6548\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a139.3\u00b10.1 km/s\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8d85\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u6846\u67b6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8bca\u65ad\u8f68\u9053\u8bef\u5dee\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e73\u53f0\u5982GNSS\u4ee5\u786e\u8ba4\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u6027\u3002"}}

This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results.

In an experiment where optical tweezers are formed by OAPs, another OAP is added to form a relay configuration with an optional microscope, resulting in near diffraction-limited performance, with a resolution of $2.19$ $\u03bcm$. The severe radially non-uniform distortion incurred by this configuration, with a long path length and a large field of view, requires software corrections for the microscopic image. To avoid overfitting given the limited features available for calibration at the tweezers focal plane, a distortion model with a reduced set of parameters is selected based on simulation data. Applying the model to experimental data, an average residual error of $3.60$ $\u03bcm$ ($1.33$ $\u03bcm$) is achieved in object space after the simple relay (adding a $5 \\times$ microscope) over a field of approximately $1$ $\u03bcm$ $\\times$ $1$ $\u03bcm$ ($200$ $\u03bcm$ $\\times$ $200$ $\u03bcm$).

We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\\tilde q$. For $n<3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, faster-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 < \u0394\\leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist).

In this work, we revisit the spin-$1$ $XY$ model on a periodic chain and construct several new families of exact scar eigenstates embedded within its extensively degenerate manifolds that owe their origins to an interplay of $U(1)$ magnetization conservation and chiral symmetries. We go beyond previously studied towers of states and first identify a novel set of interference-protected eigenstates resembling Fock space cage states, where destructive interference confines the wave function to sparse subgraphs of the Fock space. These states exhibit subextensive entanglement entropy, and when subjected to a transverse magnetic field, form equally spaced ladders whose coherent superpositions display long-lived fidelity oscillations. We further reveal a simpler organizing principle behind these nonthermal states by using the commutant algebra framework, in particular by showing that they are simultaneous eigenstates of non-commuting local operators. Moreover, in doing so, we uncover two more novel families of exact scars: a tower of volume-entangled states, and a set of mirror-dimer states with some free local degrees of freedom.

The underlying model integrates the effects of axial diffusion (molecular and multipath/eddy), finite initial spatial variance, and two distinct retention mechanisms: one characterized by a high rate of short-duration events (fast kinetics), and another by a low rate of long-duration events (slow kinetics). Fits to experimental chromatograms yield substantially smaller residual standard error (RSE) than the standard EMG and the lowest average normalised RSE among 12 established peak-shape functions in the examined cases. The stochastic approach is reformulated using single-particle probability laws, providing a rigorous basis for future theoretical extensions. The validity of the foundational Poisson assumption is critically examined by deriving expressions for the excess variance caused by correlated microscopic retention rate fluctuations. A statistical interpretation of the HETP is presented and used to determine a lower bound on the number of microscopic retention events from chromatogram-derived macroscopic observables. This, in turn, justifies the applicability of the Gaussian limit for the mobile-plus-fast component, as established by analysis of the cumulant generating function of the closed-form benchmark derived herein. The contribution from the slow-kinetic mechanism is incorporated via a decoupling approximation, whose validity is established through a cumulant-based analysis that explicitly bounds the decoupling-induced error. Finally, the notion that mechanistic heterogeneity necessarily exacerbates peak tailing is qualified, analytically delineating parameter regions in which it leads to a reduction in peak asymmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Wavelengths for 10426 spectral lines were extracted from the FT spectra, with uncertainties at least an order-of-magnitude lower than previous measurements. Wavelengths for 13397 lines from new grating spectra were determined for spectral regions beyond the FT spectra range or to provide wavelengths for weak transitions not observed in FT spectra. To aid in level identification, selected, previously published grating lines were included in the energy level optimisation, but no levels in this work relied solely on previously published wavelengths. In total, 24237 lines were included in the final spectral linelist, and these were used to identify 2186 Mn I transitions. These classified spectral lines were then used to optimise the values of 384 previously published energy levels of Mn I, with typical uncertainties of a few 10-3 cm-1, again typically an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. Our study then expanded the known energy level structure of Mn I through the establishment of 18 new energy levels, reported here for the first time. In total, 2187 lines and 402 energy levels of Mn I have been determined as a result of our work, marking a substantial advance in the precision of Mn I atomic data which will enable far more accurate analyses of Mn I lines in astrophysical spectra.\n  Please note: The final wavelength and energy level datasets are withheld from this pre-print to ensure that only the peer-reviewed, definitive versions are released.

D 34, 2550052 (2025), arXiv:2508.00035], we introduced a PT-symmetric wormhole model based on a bimetric geometry, capable of generating closed timelike curves (CTCs). In this paper, we extend the analysis to the null hypersurface at the throat of this modified Einstein-Rosen bridge, where two regular Eddington-Finkelstein metrics render the geometry traversable. Using the Barrabes--Israel formalism in Poisson's reformulation, we evaluate the null shell's surface stress-energy tensor $S^{\u03b1\u03b2}$ from the jump of the transverse curvature, revealing a violation of the null energy condition: a lightlike membrane of exotic matter with negative surface energy density and positive tangential pressure. This exotic fluid acts as a repulsive source stabilizing the throat, ensuring consistency with the Einstein field equations, including conservation laws on the shell. Beyond the local characterization, we outline potential observational signatures: (i) gravitational-wave echoes from the photon-sphere cavity; (ii) horizon-scale imaging with duplicated and through-throat photon rings, and non-Kerr asymmetries; (iii) quantum effects such as PT-induced frequency pairing with possible QNM doublets and partial suppression of vacuum flux at the throat; and (iv) a relic cosmological population yielding an effective $\u039b_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and seeding voids. Compared with timelike thin-shell constructions, our approach is based on a null junction interpreted as a lightlike membrane, combined with PT symmetry, providing a distinct route to traversability and clarifying the conditions under which CTCs can arise in a self-consistent framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

An omnidirectional S-band radar system was deployed on a research barge on the Northeastern Shelf of the United States (40.9 deg N, 70.79 deg W) and collected data for a 5-week window during the 2024 autumn bird and bat migration. The barge also sup- ported two profiling lidar systems that measured the wind speed and direction. This study presents a first methodological approach for analyzing radar and lidar data together, providing a framework for future analyses of offshore bird and bat movements that can be used to improve collision risk models. Coupling the radar animal tracks with measured wind speed profiles revealed that wind is a driver of animal pres- ence, flight direction, flight height, and flight speed. Further, a hierarchical clustering methodology was developed to investigate behavior by approximate animal size. For example, smaller animals had con- centrated flight direction distributions aligned with the wind and flew at a variety of altitudes, whereas bigger animals flew in a wide variety of directions but were concentrated at low altitudes.

However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels.

A leading candidate for the plasma-facing material is tungsten due to its high melting point, however, the energy levels and wavefunctions of high-Z atoms with many electrons (e.g. 30 or more), including tungsten, are difficult to calculate with high accuracy. Gaps and large uncertainties in atomic data for tungsten introduce design and performance uncertainties for a fusion power plant. Specifically, improved atomic data for ionization potential, excited state energies, and collisional excitation rates are needed for the low charge states of atomic tungsten. We aim to address these shortcomings by using the semistochastic heat-bath configuration interaction (SHCI) method, which nearly exactly calculates the energies that can be determined at higher cost with the full configuration interaction. Adding well-motivated approximations to SHCI, including orbital optimization and effective core potentials, we demonstrate good agreement between our calculated first ionization potentials and the best available experimental values for chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten.

Yet, their practical utility remains constrained by unpredictable performance degradation under real-world noise conditions. A key question is how problem structure itself influences algorithmic resilience. In this work, we present a comprehensive, hardware-aware benchmarking study of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm across 11 diverse test patterns on multiple superconducting quantum processors, revealing that algorithmic performance is exquisitely sensitive to problem structure. Our results reveal average success rates of 100.0\\% (ideal simulation), 85.2\\% (noisy emulation), and 26.4\\% (real hardware), representing a dramatic 58.8\\% average performance gap between noisy emulation and real hardware execution. With quantum state tomography confirming corresponding average state fidelities of 0.993, 0.760, and a 0.234 fidelity drop to hardware. Performance degrades dramatically from 75.7\\% success for sparse patterns to complete failure for high-density 10-qubit patterns. Most strikingly, quantum state tomography reveals a near-perfect correlation between pattern density and state fidelity degradation, providing the fundamental explanation for observed performance patterns. The catastrophic fidelity collapse observed in real hardware measurements -- dropping to 0.111 compared to the predicted 0.763 -- underscores severe limitations in current noise models for capturing structure-dependent error mechanisms.

Our analytical framework captures the essential features of this refraction Hall effect, and the resulting Hall conductivity profile is corroborated by numerical simulations across different lattice models and device geometries. We further visualize our predicted effect through real-time wave packet dynamics, which reveals its purely geometric origin and the robustness of the transverse response.

We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\u03bc\u03bd} R^{\u03bc\u03bd})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length.

Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincar\u00e9 spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom.

The theory overcomes the known obstacles to unitary global SUSY on de Sitter because the commutator between two SUSY transformations closes on the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$ rather than the de Sitter algebra $so(4,1)$.

Based on recent advancements in reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT), a variant of DFT that is believed to be better suited for strongly correlated systems, we construct a mathematical framework generalizing all ground state functional theories, which in particular applies to fermionic, bosonic, and spin systems. We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary.

The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Close to phase transitions, they respond collectively to external perturbations, which can be harnessed for technological applications in the domain of quantum metrology and sensing. Owing to the controllable complexity and straightforward interpretability of Rydberg atoms, we can observe and tune the emergent collective nonlinearity. Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced. This is reflected in an increase of the accuracy with which future values of the time series can be predicted.

This choice of formulation is independent from the remaining gauge choice $x\\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ in to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse.

In this work, we extend this framework to construct a broad class of logical gates for general CSS codes, including the S, Hadamard, T, and (multi-)controlled-Z gates, under the condition where fault-tolerance or circuit-depth optimality is not necessarily imposed. We show that these logical gates can be expressed as exponential of polynomial functions of the electric and magnetic gauge fields, which allows us to derive explicit decompositions into physical gates. We further prove that their logical action depends only on the (co)homology classes of the corresponding logical qubits, establishing consistency as logical operations.

By considering noise induced error in the initial system state preparation, we analyse the robustness of various models exhibiting the QME. We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0QME\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u566a\u58f0\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u70ed\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684QME\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u590d\u539f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22QME\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad \u65b9\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u52a0\u901f\u70ed\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8003\u8651U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u968f\u673a\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6062\u590d via \u589e\u52a0\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\uff1b\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8f83\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eGKSL\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u70ed\u5316\uff1b\u5728U(1)\u5bf9\u79f0\u968f\u673a\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6062\u590d\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684QME\uff1b\u5f53\u51fa\u73b0\u8f83\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0cQME\u901f\u7387\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "QME\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u9009\u62e9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6062\u590d\u8981\u6c42\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u3001\u975e\u6676\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u78c1\u6027\u5c42\u540e\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u529f\u80fd\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5148\u8fdb\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u53d1\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u589e\u5f3a\u540e\u5728\u03c0\u8f68\u9053\u95f4\u53d1\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u89c2\u6269\u5c55\uff0c spins\u5728\u73b0\u5c42\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u573a\u81f4\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u6fc0\u53d1\u5f15\u5165\u529f\u80fd\u5c42\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u529f\u80fd\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

By structuring matter at the mesoscale, they bridge atomic magnetism and macroscopic functionality, enabling emergent behaviour inaccessible in conventional materials. However, realizing large-area metamaterials that combine high morphological uniformity with intrinsic long-range order has remained challenging, largely due to the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication. Here we demonstrate a scalable route to structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials by embedding iron-ions to form mesospins within a non-magnetic thin film palladium host matrix. Using controlled implantation, we realize morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order in the as-fabricated state - without the need of external annealing or field cycling. Resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy reveal sharp magnetic Bragg peaks modulated by the mesospin form factor, evidencing long-range antiferromagnetic order coupled to structural coherence.

These higher moments lead to more general quantum modifications of the Newtonian potential (qMOND potentials expressed in terms of Gauss and Appell hypergeometric functions), more general (steeper) MOND interpolating functions, and a new modification of MOND at low accelerations (mMOND) that features an almost-flat asymptotic rotation curve $\\propto r^{-1/18}$, which is expected to operate at approximately the same galactic scales as MOND.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND)\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884canonical\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d77\u4f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u725b\u987f\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684qMOND\u548cmMOND\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "MOND\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u542b\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5929\u6587\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u9884canonical\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684MOND\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u975e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u9884canonical\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u77e9\uff08\u7b2c\u4e09\u548c\u7b2c\u56db\uff09\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u725b\u987f\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178MOND\u66f4\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u7684qMOND\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u7684mMOND\u52bf\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u4f4e\u52a0\u901f\u533a\u57df\u5448\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38 flats \u589e\u957f\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eMOND\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u540c\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u9884canonical\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86MOND\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u661f\u7cfb\u65cb\u8f6c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002"}}

On the other hand, higher derivatives lead to classical instabilities and a loss of unitarity at the quantum level.

We demonstrate that these requirements for a consistent quantum theory are satisfied in a theory we have recently proposed.

We relate the minimum time to the Quantum Fisher Information ($F_Q$) for a system of $N$ quantum spins on a $d$-dimensional lattice with $1/r^\u03b1$ interactions with $r$ being the distance between two interacting spins. We focus on states with $F_Q \\sim N^{1+\u03b3}$ where $\u03b3\\in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($\u03b1> 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \\gtrsim L^\u03b3$, where $L \\sim N^{1/d}$. For long-range interactions, we find a hierarchy of possible speedups: $t \\gtrsim L^{\u03b3(\u03b1-2d)}$ for $2d < \u03b1< 2d+1$, $t \\gtrsim \\log L$ for $(2-\u03b3)d < \u03b1< 2d$, and $t$ may even vanish algebraically in $1/L$ for $\u03b1< (2-\u03b3)d$. These bounds extend to the minimum circuit depth required for state preparation, assuming two-qubit gate speeds scale as $1/r^\u03b1$.

The nearly ideal one-dimensional $S=1/2$ system $\u03b2$-VOSO$_4$ without long-range order down to 85 mK provides a promising platform to experimentally explore such fractionalized excitations. Here, we employ Raman spectroscopy to probe magnetic excitations and the evolution of spin correlations in $\u03b2$-VOSO$_4$. Spinon signatures are found along the chain direction, evidenced by a broad, gapless scattering continuum at low temperatures.

Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations.

Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms.

A generalization of this framework, known as the EVH/CFT correspondence, has been developed for four- and five-dimensional AdS black holes. It was further proposed in arXiv:1910.14293 that a generalized duality between $(D-2)$ dimensional geometry and $(D-3)$ dimensional field theory may emerge in AdS$_{D=6,7}$ black holes under a suitably defined extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. In this work, we demonstrate that the near-EVH geometries arising in these AdS$_{6,7}$ black hole models are not of the standard lower dimensional AdS kinds of black holes to establish a lower dimensional version of AdS/CFT correspondence, but instead belong to the family of Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton (EMMD) gravity theories.

The theory is parameterized by a single dimensionless constant, and it is continuously connected to Yang-Mills theory in its vanishing limit. We show that the theory admits (anti-)self-dual instantons, despite the additional nonlinearities that characterize the non-Abelian ModMax theory. For $SU(2)$, we construct the generalization of the BPST instanton and extend this solution to Euclidean de Sitter and anti-de Sitter backgrounds. In the latter case, the Chern-Pontryagin index depends on the instanton size since the configuration is not a pure gauge at infinity; a property already pointed out in Yang-Mills on negative-curvature backgrounds by Callan and Wilczek. We compute the contribution of the latter to the spectrum of the Dirac operator at the boundary, which is crucial for determining the non-local contributions to the Dirac index. Then, we show that the ansatz constructed with 't Hooft symbols accommodates multi-instantons in the non-Abelian ModMax theory. The system of (anti-)self-dual equations reduces to a single nonlinear equation, which can be perturbatively solved order by order in the parameter that controls the nonlinearity. Following such a strategy, we provide a formal solution for the $N$-instanton configuration to first order in the expansion.

In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies.

We find this compound has a relatively wide width of formation, and grow single crystals with compositions Fe$_x$Pd$_{y}$Te$_2$ where $x$ ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 and $y$ from 1.8 to 2.5, respectively. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and transport measurements reveal that a first-order structural transition occurs in the range of $T$ = 360-420 K. Above the transition, the compounds with Pd fraction $y>2$ adopt a disordered derivative of the tetragonal FeTe structure, with the Fe layer showing mixed Fe/Pd occupancy and the extra Pd atoms partially occupying interstitial sites. Below 370 K, the structure is incommensurately modulated. For $y<2$, the composition Fe$_{1.1}$Pd$_{1.8}$Te$_2$ has monoclinic symmetry at room temperature that is consistent with the reported structure of FePd$_2$Te$_2$. This phase undergoes a structural transition at 420 K for which the high temperature structure is yet to be determined; however, based on the similarities with the $y > 2$ compounds, we speculate that this composition also adopts a tetragonal structure above 420\\,K.

The thermal backreaction is incorporated through a dissipation coefficient that depends linearly on the temperature, and the model parameters are chosen to remain consistent with Planck observational constraints. By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics. Our results reveal that, while transition to radiation domination is suppressed in the weak regime, the strong dissipative regime leads to a smooth and natural transition to a hot, radiation-dominated Universe, thereby confirming graceful-exit within warm inflation in the quartic scenario. The reheating temperature is extracted directly from the nonlinear evolution of warm inflation, yielding a temperature of approximately 10^13 GeV at the end of inflation, which cools to about 10^12 GeV near radiation-inflaton equality, whence the Universe transitions into a radiation-dominated era.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86 Warm \u81a8\u80c0\u7531\u56db\u9636\u52bf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u8026\u5408\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86 Warm \u81a8\u80c0\u5728\u56db\u9636\u52bf\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7136 graceful-exit \u548c reheating \u6e29\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a 10^13 GeV\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u81f3\u7ea6 10^12 GeV \u65f6 Universe \u8f6c\u5165\u8f90\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684 ", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 Warm \u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u540e reheating \u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u786e\u5b9a graceful-exit \u673a\u5236\u548c reheating \u6e29\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u3002 ", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u4e09\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ec4\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0 inflaton \u573a\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u80fd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u81a8\u80c0\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e29\u5ea6\u7684\u8870\u53d8\u901f\u7387\u7cfb\u6570\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3002 ", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86 Warm \u81a8\u80c0\u5728\u56db\u9636\u52bf\u4e0b\u5141\u8bb8\u81ea\u7136\u7684 graceful-exit\uff0creheating \u6e29\u5ea6\u4e3a\u7ea6 10^13 GeV\uff0c\u51b7\u5374\u540e Universe \u8f6c\u4e3a\u8f90\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002 ", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cWarm \u81a8\u80c0\u5728\u56db\u9636\u52bf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u7a7f\u8d8a\u5230\u8f90\u5c04\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684 Universe\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86 Four \u7684 graceful-exit \u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684 reheating \u6e29\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Lett. 122, 234003 (2023)], we reduce phase fluctuations and overall optical losses in the measurement system. In particular, we introduce a novel phase detection technique that does not require tapping a part of the squeezed light to get a phase locking signal. We use a phase-detection OPA seeded by a tapped probe and pump light before a squeezer OPA. This configuration breaks the conventional trade-off between generating a phase-locking signal with high-signal-to-noise ratio and suppressing degradation of squeezing level caused by optical tapping. With all these improvements, the phase fluctuation angle is reduced from 14 mrad to 9 mrad, and the total optical loss from 12\\% to 8\\%. Achieving more than 10 dB of squeezing by the broadband waveguide OPA is a significant step towards realization of fault-tolerant ultra-fast universal optical quantum computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For finite-time processes, part of the extractable work is inevitably dissipated, motivating the search for driving protocols that minimize the work. While classical stochastic systems have been extensively explored, quantum analyses remain limited and often rely on Markovian master equations valid only in the weak-coupling regime. Here, we study minimal work protocols for representative two-level systems coupled to a harmonic-oscillator bath using a numerically exact method. Inspired by known optimal solutions for Brownian oscillators, we introduce an impulse ansatz that incorporates possible boundary impulses and test it across a wide range of bath parameters. We find that impulse-like features remain nearly optimal in the quantum, non-Markovian regime, at short times.

We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings.

The variational parameters in our ansatz are derived from a global action principle, where Euler-Lagrange equations govern their optimal dynamics. Unlike conventional wavefunction-based variational methods, our approach specifically targets the time evolution operation and this allows a single set of optimized parameters to be applied to any initial state for a fixed Hamiltonian avoiding costly optimization procedures. Our method outperforms the standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas, typically achieving higher accuracy than higher-order Suzuki schemes. This translates directly to quantum computing applications, where it enables the design of quantum circuits with fewer gates which reduces noise and improves precision. Although we focus on quantum dynamics, the method is broadly applicable to problems involving general time-evolution operators. Applied to various model Hamiltonians, our approach reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, demonstrating its promise for accurate quantum simulation with improved efficiency. In certain cases, the variational ansatz achieves higher accuracy than more complex higher-order Suzuki formulas while reducing the gate count by nearly half within a single circuit layer.

This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories. More recently, Freidel and Teh have suggested an additional criterion for substantial general covariance, namely that the action should also yield a non-trivial corner charge associated to diffeomorphism invariance. However, this too appears insufficient, since such actions can always be constructed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Extending the Krasi\u0144ski-Hellaby (KH) LTB reconstruction method, we show how set of three functions defined on two arbitrary hypersurfaces can fully determine the spacetime geometry. We further restrict our attention to the bounded case and develop the weak-field and the small-angular-momentum approximations. We show how these can be applied to the exact solution on the initial hypersurface, together with the oscillatory solution on the final hypersurface, to considerably simplify the reconstruction scheme.

In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Ben\u00edtez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces.

To address this issue, a quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is proposed, in which a quantum Measurement Clustering method is introduced to detect backdoors by identifying statistical anomalies in measurement outputs. It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios. Evaluations under various quantum attack scenarios demonstrate that QSentry delivers superior robustness and accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art detection methods. This work establishes a practical and effective framework for mitigating backdoor threats in QML.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, routing cryptographic keys across multi-hop quantum networks introduces challenges unique to quantum communication. This survey analyzes and classifies 26 routing strategies proposed between 2013 and 2024 for terrestrial, satellite, and hybrid QKD infrastructures. Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links.

We present the first experimental demonstration of an optomechanical disk resonator prepared in the quantum ground state. With a gigahertz frequency, the mechanical breathing mode of the investigated semiconductor disk reaches a level of excitation below a single phonon when cooled in a dilution refrigerator. We quantify the phonon occupancy of the mechanical mode by performing Brillouin sideband spectroscopy: a conical optical fiber is evanescently coupled to the disk optical whispering-gallery mode, and Stokes and anti-Stokes photons scattered by phonon emission and absorption are counted on a single-photon detector. We measure a suppression of the absorption process corresponding to a phonon occupancy of $0.66\\pm0.20$. We experimentally investigate the mechanisms ruling laser-induced heating, which limits the lowest measurable phonon occupancy, and notably witness an extra-cavity heating effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u673a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5149\u673a\u76d8\u632f\u5b50\u5668\u5c1a\u672a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea7 regime \u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u6001\u7684\u5149\u673a\u76d8\u632f\u5b50\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2asemiconductor\u76d8\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u547c\u5438\u6a21\u5f0f\u9891\u7387\u4e3a gigahertz\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u51b7\u5374\u540e\u5728\u7a00\u8584\u51b0\u7bb1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5355\u516c\u62a5\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Brillouin \u8fb9\u5e26\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e86\u673a\u68b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9525\u5f62\u5149\u7ea4\u4e0e\u76d8\u5149\u5b66\u7684whispering-gallery mode \u8fdb\u884c\u5b8c\u8870\u53d8\u53d1\u5c04\u548c\u5438\u6536\uff0cMat\u6d4b\u5f97\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\u4e3a $0.66\trimmegno+/-0.20$\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u52a0\u70ed\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u6d4b\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8154\u52a0\u70ed\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u673a\u68b0\u5728\u5149\u673a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5904\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u673a\u68b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9525\u5f62\u5149\u7ea4\u4e0e\u5149\u58f0\u8154\u7684whispering-gallery mode \u505a\u7684Brillouin\u8fb9\u5e26\u5149\u8c31\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cfStokes\u548canti-Stokes \u5149\u5b50\u6765\u4f30\u7b97\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u52a0\u70ed\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8154\u52a0\u70ed\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u673a\u76d8\u632f\u5b50\u5668\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u6001\u3002\u76d8\u632f\u5b50\u5668Frequency\u4e3a gigahertz\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u51b7\u5374\u540e\u8fdb\u5165\u5355\u516c\u62a5\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7Brillouin\u4fa7\u5e26\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u786e\u5207\u7684\u6570\u503c $0.66\trimmegno+/-0.20$\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u52a0\u70ed\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8154\u4f53\u52a0\u70ed\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u6d4b\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u673a\u76d8\u632f\u5b50\u5668\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Brillouin\u4fa7\u5e26\u5149\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e86\u58f0\u5b50\u5360\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u5149\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u66f4\u5c0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a general framework that extends piecewise-deterministic unravelings to arbitrary trace-nonpreserving master equations, requiring only positivity and Hermiticity of the dynamics. Our approach includes, as special cases, unravelings of arbitrary dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, evolutions interpolating between fully Lindblad and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian generators, and equations employed in the derivation of full counting statistics, for which we show it can be used to obtain the moments of the associated probability distribution. The framework is suitable for both trace-decreasing and trace-increasing processes through stochastic disappearance and replication of the stochastic realizations, and it is compatible with different unraveling schemes and with reverse jumps in the non-Markovian regime. Thereby, our approach provides a powerful and versatile simulation method that significantly broadens the applicability of stochastic techniques for open system dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

To improve reliability in such settings, we study an adaptive diversity strategy for discrete-variable QuMIMO systems based on universal asymmetric cloning at the transmitter and probabilistic purification at the receiver. An input qubit is encoded into M approximate clones, transmitted over an N x N multi-mode quantum channel, and recovered through a purification map optimized using available channel state information (CSI). For the given cloning asymmetry parameters, we derive an eigenvalue-based expression for the decoder-optimal end-to-end fidelity in the form of a generalized Rayleigh quotient, which enables efficient tuning of the cloner without iterative optimization. As a design choice, we employ semidefinite program (SDP) to construct the purification map for only a targeted success probability p. This numerical framework is used to study fixed-noise, dimension-scaling noise, and stochastic depolarization regimes.

To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints.

This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality.

One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from \"simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence\" to \"compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction\", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks.

We show that paradigmatic multivariate functions can be accurately prepared such as, by numerical simulations, a 17-dimensional Gaussian encoded in the state of 102 qubits and, through experiments, a 9-dimensional Gaussian realized using 54 qubits on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

A measurement device or detector in a quantum experiment is characterized by a set of positive operator-valued measure (POVM) elements; the goal of QMT is to estimate these operators from experimental data. To ensure physically valid (positive and complete) POVM reconstructions, we propose two distinct parameterization schemes within the SGD framework: one leveraging optimization on a Stiefel manifold and one based on Hermitian operator normalization via eigenvalue scaling. Within the SGD-QMT framework, we further investigate two loss functions: mean squared error, equivalent to L2 or Euclidean norm, and average negative log-likelihood, inspired by maximum likelihood estimation. We benchmark performance against state-of-the-art constrained convex optimization methods. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, compared to standard methods, our SGD-QMT algorithms offer significantly lower computational cost, superior reconstruction fidelity, and enhanced robustness to noise. We make a Python implementation of the SGD-QMT algorithms publicly available at \\href{https://github.com/agtomo/SGD-QMT}{github.com/agtomo/SGD-QMT}.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}
