The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7d2b\u7403\u83cc\u4e2dLH2\u548cLH3\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5149\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5149\u8c31\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u4e8e\u5149\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u5149\u80fd\u5438\u6536\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u5149\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6c22\u952e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6c\u89d2\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eLH3\u4e2d\u6c22\u952e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8f6c\u89d2\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5149\u8c31\u5cf0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u89e3\u6790\u5149\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u8272\u7d20\u590d\u5408\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Starting from a Poisson photon-counting model for bi-exponential fluorescence decays convolved with a finite instrument response function (IRF) and including additive background, we derive FI for both time-binned TCSPC histograms and programmable time-gated acquisitions. To ensure robustness when nuisance parameters such as IRF width, temporal offset, and background level are uncertain, we compute an effective FI using a Schur-complement marginalization and select hardware-feasible temporal designs by maximizing D-optimal criteria over candidate libraries. Across instrument-agnostic simulations spanning IRF broadening and increasing background fractions, FI-driven temporal designs consistently improve photon efficiency relative to uniform sampling, while nuisance-aware planning yields more stable gains under mismatch than naive optimization. Monte Carlo studies with maximum-likelihood estimation confirm that higher effective FI translates into reduced estimator variance and improved parametric map quality at fixed photon budgets. Finally, we map the same FI core to two practical deployment pathways: adaptive re-binning for TCSPC FLIM and adaptive gate placement/width selection for time-gated FLIM, enabling information-theoretic acquisition without hardware modification.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a Fisher-information (FI) framework for photon-efficient fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) using temporal sampling as a controllable design variable under a fixed photon budget.

In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\u00f6rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \\re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \\re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \\re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a natural candidate, but the electronic zero-field splitting exhibits a large fractional temperature dependence, which has precluded its use as a stable clock transition. Here we show that this limitation can be overcome by forming a composite frequency reference that combines measurements of the electronic splitting D with the nuclear quadrupole splitting of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin intrinsic to the NV center. We further benchmark this composite approach against alternative strategies for mitigating temperature sensitivity. By implementing a specially designed pulse sequence with an eight-phase control scheme that suppresses pulse imperfections, we interleave measurements of D and Q in a high-density NV ensemble and demonstrate a temperature-compensated composite frequency reference. The stability of this composite diamond clock is characterized over a 10-day period at room temperature through a comparison to a Rb vapor-cell clock, yielding a fractional instability below $5 \\times 10^{-9}$ for an averaging time of $\u03c4= 200$ s and below $1 \\times 10^{-8}$ at $\u03c4= 2 \\times 10^5$ s, corresponding to measured improvements by a factor of 4 and 200, respectively, over a clock based purely on the single frequency D for the same periods. By characterizing the residual sensitivity to magnetic fields, optical power, and radio-frequency drive amplitudes, we find that temperature is no longer the dominant source of instability.

This gives rise to a series of exceptional points of two types, the intra-band and the inter-band. Leveraging the topology of the spectral Riemann surface close to these exceptional points, we demonstrate the path-dependent chiral transfer of atoms to the higher-lying bands, by evolving the system along closed loops in the parameter space. Specifically, we illustrate two distinct scenarios, characterized by different mechanisms, where the atoms can be transferred to designated SOAMC-dressed bands.

Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport.\n  In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order).\n  Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations.

Several quantities are computed, including the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI), entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS), and butterfly velocity ($v_B$). Our findings demonstrate that these measures can effectively diagnose phase transitions. Notably, EWCS and MI, as mixed-state entanglement measures, exhibit behavior opposite to that of the HEE. Additionally, we study the butterfly velocity, a dynamic quantum information measure, and observe that it behaves differently from the static quantum information measures. We propose that the butterfly velocity is initially dominated by entanglement and subsequently by thermal entropy as the coupling constant increases. Moreover, we examine the scaling behavior of the holographic entanglement measures and find that all the critical exponents are equal to $1$, which is twice that of the scalar field. We also explore the inequality between EWCS and MI, noting that the growth rate of MI consistently exceeds that of EWCS during phase transitions.

In the thermodynamic limit ($N\\to\\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\u03bb_{\\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5177\u6709\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u96c6\u4f53\u963b\u5c3c\u7684\u5de8\u78c1\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570(MLE)\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u3001\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u548c\u5468\u671f\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u78c1\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86 Lindblad \u4e3b\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982MLE\u3001\u5206\u5c94\u56fe\u7b49\uff09\u6765\u523b\u5212\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u5c42\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6548\u5e94\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6781\u9650\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002MLE\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5224\u65ad\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6536\u655b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u5728Lyapunov\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u7406\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u5143\u7d20\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u6027\u8d28\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u786e\u8ba4\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that RPA-based LNO-CC closely matches the performance of its MP2-based counterpart for systems with sizable energy gaps, while delivering significantly faster convergence toward the canonical coupled-cluster limit for metallic systems, particularly as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

Interestingly, temperature-dependent bulk susceptibility curve shows ferrimagnetic-like behaviour above the magnetic ordering at around 40 K, which were corroborated by the identification of the mixed valence states, Ru5+ and Ru4+ via X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Structural analysis further revealed atomic-site exchange between the Ru and Sc sites, which results in the Ru mixed valence states. Neutron powder diffraction measurements detected the presence of magnetic Bragg peaks at a low temperature near 4 K and a moderate magnetoelastic coupling near the ordering temperature of 40 K. However, the corresponding symmetry analysis shows a weak Type I antiferromagnetic ground state with a reduced magnetic moment of 1.1\u03bcB/Ru atom. Our findings establish an unusual magnetic ground state in the Mott insulating Ca2ScRuO6, where a long range ordered antiferromagnet coexists with small magnetic clusters, which manifests a ferrimagnetic-like high temperature inverse magnetic susceptibility.

These include the instrumental scenario, which for binary variables has recently been shown to follow the same inefficiency bounds as the bipartite dichotomic Bell scenario; the prepare-and-measure scenario, where inefficiencies impact the certification of a quantum system's dimension and create security breaches in protocols such as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD); and the bilocality scenario, which exemplifies how employing multiple independent sources can significantly relax the required efficiencies to certify non-classical correlations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Within this framework, we expanded our previous dataset, MORE-Q, to MORE-QX by sampling a larger conformational space of interactions between BOV molecules and mucin-derived receptors. This dataset provides extensive electronic binding features (BFs) computed upon BOV adsorption. Analysis of MORE-QX property space revealed weak correlations between QM properties of building blocks and resulting BFs.

Benchmarking showed CatBoost models outperform alternatives, especially in transferability to unseen compounds. Explainable AI methods further highlighted which QM properties most influence BF predictions.

However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems.

However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Realized in a granular aluminum dimer with Kerr nonlinearity, our method demonstrates a sixfold bandwidth increase at 20 dB gain, surpasses the conventional gain$-$bandwidth scaling up to 25 dB, and remains near the quantum limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u770b\u5230 essays \u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ecb\u7ecd\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d85\u5bfc\u632f\u8361\u6ce2\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u58f0obox \u9650\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7c92\u72b6\u94dd\u4e8c\u5143\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u6750\u6599\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Kerr\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7531\u53cc\u8c03\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u7ec4\u6210\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u65bd\u52a0\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fdd\u62a4\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u572820dB\u589e\u76ca\u4e0b\uff0c\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u5355\u8fb9\u5e26\u5bbd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u76ca-\u5e26\u5bbd\u6807\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e00\u500d\u591a\uff0c\u5373\u516d\u500d\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u4e24\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u8c03\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u589e\u76ca\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u653e\u5927\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u8d77\u632f\u8361\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5355\u8fb9\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002"}}

Here, we utilize second harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry to demonstrate giant anisotropic optical nonlinearities in BiTeBr and BiTeI driven by contributions to the crystals' nonlinear polarizability originating from their permanent dipole moment. In addition, using SHG microscopy, we show that BiTeI displays a distinctive SHG spatial texture consisting of thread-like regions of reduced harmonic intensity. These features demark the boundaries between phase and anti-phase polar domains, confirmed via piezoresponse force microscopy and are attributable to disorder-driven restoration of inversion symmetry and concomitant optical interference effects.

In this work, we uncover a novel class of dynamical, crystal-like localization patterns in real space, arising from the hybridization of magnons with topologically non-trivial spin textures that possess helicity as an internal degree of freedom. By tuning the magnon wavelength to match the size of these textures, specifically, atomic-scale skyrmions in centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, we achieve strong interference effects. This leads to the emergence of magnon superlattices, shaped by the internal skyrmion structure and the underlying Mexican-hat magnon dispersion. Furthermore, helicity-driven nonlinear dynamics give rise to dispersive magnon bands with nontrivial Chern numbers within the first magnon gap. These findings provide fundamental insights into magnon behavior in complex spin environments and establish frustrated magnets as a versatile platform for manipulating spin excitations at the atomic scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u78c1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5316\u78c1\u5b50\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u5e26\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u65cb\u626d\u66f2\u5ea6\u7684\u78c1\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u6676\u683c\u78c1\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u78c1\u5b50\u6ce2\u957f\u4e0e\u78c1\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u78c1\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u78c1\u5b50\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u5b50\u7684 mexican-hat \u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u7684 skyrmion \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u78c1\u5b50\u8d85\u6676\u683c\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u626d\u66f2\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6Chern\u6570\u7684\u8272\u6563\u78c1\u5b50\u5e26\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u65cb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53cd frustrations\u78c1\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u64cd\u7eb5\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\uff0c\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u5b66\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u9762\uff0c/yang\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u53cd frustrations\u78c1\u4f53\u5e73\u53f0\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u8981\u6d89\u53ca\u78c1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3001skyrmion\u7ed3\u6784\u3001mexican-hat \u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u53ca\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u78c1\u5b50\u8d85\u7ea7\u6676\u683c\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u8272\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u5e26\u6709\u5185\u90e8\u81ea\u65cb\u626d\u66f2\u5ea6\u7684\u78c1\u5b50\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5316\u78c1\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u78c1\u5b50\u6ce2\u957f\u4e0e\u78c1\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u78c1\u5b50\u5e72\u6d89\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u78c1\u5b50\u8d85\u7ea7\u6676\u683c\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u5b50 mexican-hat \u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5185\u90e8 skyrmion \u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u78c1\u5b50\u8d85\u7ea7\u6676\u683c\u3002\u7b2c\u4e09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u78c1\u5b50\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u626d\u66f2\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6Chern\u6570\u7684\u8272\u6563\u78c1\u5b50\u5e26\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u65cb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u78c1\u5b50\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53cd frustrations\u78c1\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u64cd\u7eb5\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec6\u7c92\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u53cd frustrations\u78c1\u4f53\u5728\u5fae\u7eb3\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

It had been a long-standing open question whether interacting bosonic systems also feature finite speeds of sound in information and particle propagation, which was only recently resolved.

We construct a POD--DeepONet surrogate for the discrete band map along the standard high-symmetry path by coupling a POD trunk extracted from high-fidelity finite-element band snapshots with a neural branch network that predicts reduced coefficients. This architecture yields a compact and differentiable forward model that is tailored to the underlying Bloch eigenvalue discretization. We establish continuity of the discrete band map on the relaxed design space and prove a uniform approximation property of the POD--DeepONet surrogate, leading to a natural decomposition of the total surrogate error into POD truncation and network approximation contributions. Building on this forward surrogate, we formulate two end-to-end neural inverse design procedures, namely dispersion-to-structure and band-gap inverse design, with training objectives that combine data misfit, binarity promotion, and supervised regularization to address the intrinsic non-uniqueness of the inverse mapping and to enable stable gradient-based optimization in the relaxed space. Our numerical results show that the proposed framework achieves accurate forward predictions and produces effective inverse designs on practical high-contrast, pixel-based photonic layouts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408POD\u548cDeepONet\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u5e26\u56fe\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5747\u5300\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u603b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aPOD\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u662f\u8272\u6563\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9891\u6bb5\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u5316\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u5411\u54cd\u5e94\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u5728\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u6b21\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7535\u8def\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u5176\u51fd\u6570\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7POD\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9636\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7684\u9891\u70b9\u7247\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528DeepONet\u9884\u6d4b\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5747\u5300\u903c\u8fd1\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u603b\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u5316\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8c\u7ef4p4m\u5bf9\u79f0\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\u0394_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\u0394_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\u0394_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\u0394_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\u0394_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86II\u578b\u53cc\u5c42\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5173\u4e8e\u0394_T\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u540e\u0394_T\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u566a\u97f3\u5206\u6790\u662f\u5fae\u5c0f\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4ea4\u53c9\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u5305\u542b\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u0394_T\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\uff0c\u0394_T\u566a\u58f0\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u8f93\u8fd0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u0394_T\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Andreev\u53cd\u5c04\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This approach opens a direct route to hyperbolic temporal metamaterials and, in particular, hyperbolic time crystals. We demonstrate that the very process responsible for time crystal formation can simultaneously compensate for intrinsic material losses in the supporting medium - overcoming one of the central challenges in nanophotonics. The realization of truly lossless hyperbolic media, long considered as one of the key challenges of nanophotonics, unlocks new possibilities for subwavelength light focusing, strong-field physics, and novel regimes of light-matter interaction. Crucially, the proposed approach can be implemented using existing materials and readily available light sources, making it both practical and transformative.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Using the Keldysh formalism within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework, we derive analytical expressions for radiative power, force, and torque. To enable angular momentum radiation, an out-of-plane magnetic field is applied to break reciprocity, resulting in gyrotropic terms in the permittivity tensor. By approximating the emitter as a thin film, the photon Green's functions can be solved analytically. Expressions for the Poynting vector and Maxwell's stress tensor can subsequently be extracted from the lesser Green's function, which governs the field correlations. The final radiation formulas can be expressed in terms of Fresnel coefficients, revealing an insightful connection to energy conservation via Kirchhoff's law. Using the Wigner transform, the analytical expression for the radiative torque can also be related to the generalized Fresnel coefficients.

Unfortunately, most currently used X-ray two-dimensional (2D) detectors suffer from a fundamental trade-off between the number of pixels and readout time, making them unsuitable for fast moving objects imaging, as well as the readout dead time causes frame losses. X-ray ghost imaging (XGI) offers an alternative approach to image an object using only a highly sensitive single-pixel detector. However, a critical limitation of existing XGI methods is the excessive total acquisition time required, rendering it impractical for real applications. In this paper, we propose a rapid spatial modulation scheme based on random binary patterns encoded onto a fast-spinning mask. Clear X-ray visualization of moving objects is demonstrated with imaging rates up to 200 frames per second with a resolution of 225 um.

Combining the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism with the generalized coset construction, we formulate a symmetry-based effective action that incorporates both conservative and dissipative effects. The effective theory implements the dynamical Kubo-Martin-Schwinger symmetry, ensuring consistency with the fluctuation-dissipation relation and Onsager's reciprocal relations. Within this framework, we derive the entropy current associated with dissipative photon dynamics and demonstrate the non-negativity of its divergence, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. We also clarify the symmetry origin of the gauge redundancy in the unbroken phase within the Schwinger-Keldysh framework, relating it to strong and weak realizations of higher-form symmetries.

In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u6ce2\u957f\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u94c1\u78c1\u3001\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u3001\u5149\u5b50\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u6742\u4e71\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u5728\u957f\u6ce2\u957f\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u653e\u5927\u3001\u975e\u4e92\u60e0\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u81ea\u65cb cloak\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u6027\u76ae\u80a4\u6548\u5e94\u3001PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f85\u52a9\u7684Floquet\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d7\u78c1\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f2a\u975e\u5384\u7c73\u7269\u7406\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6fc0\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

We consider an interaction between ghost dark energy and dark matter with a sign-changeable interaction term. To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, as seen in the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh (JLMS) formula, exact quantum error correction with complementary recovery (and thus entanglement wedge reconstruction) emerges only in the limit $G \\to 0$. As a result, precise arguments controlling error terms have focused on what we call `small' codes which, as $G \\to 0$, describe only perturbative excitations near a given classical solution. Such settings are quite restrictive and, in particular, they prohibit discussion of any modular flow that would change the classical background. As a result, they forbid consideration of modular flows generated by semiclassical bulk states at order-one modular parameters.\n  In contrast, we present a single `large' code for the bulk theory that can accommodate such flows and, in particular, in the $G \\to 0$ limit includes superpositions of states associated with distinct classical backgrounds. This large code is assembled from small codes that each satisfy an approximate Faulkner-Lewkowycz-Maldacena formula.

We realized the planar bilayer ARC experimentally, demonstrating excellent mid-infrared anti-reflectance across over a broad range of angles for all polarizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u8584\u53cd\u53cd\u5c04\u6d82\u5c42\uff08ARCs\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfARCs\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5355\u5f62\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u5c42\u548c\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u6781\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u53cd\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5fae\u6ce2\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u4f5c\u7528\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c06\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u53cd\u53cd\u5c04\u6d82\u5c42\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Structure\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5355\u5f62\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u5c42\u548c\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c42\u72b6\u53cc\u6298\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684ARCs\u5728\u5bbd\u5e7f\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u548c\u6240\u6709\u6781\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u53cd\u53cd\u5c04\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u53cd\u5c04\u6d82\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6750\u6599\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To appear in the IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) 2026", "summary": "Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a promising technique for scaling up quantum systems. While significant progress has been made in DQC for quantum circuit models, there exists much less research on DQC for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC), which is a universal quantum computing model that is essentially different from the circuit model and particularly well-suited to photonic quantum platforms. In this paper, we propose DC-MBQC, the first distributed quantum compilation framework tailored for MBQC. We identify and address two key challenges in enabling DQC for MBQC. First, for task allocation among quantum processing units (QPUs), we develop an adaptive graph partitioning algorithm that preserves the structure of the graph state while balancing the workload across QPUs. Second, for inter-QPU communication, we introduce the layer scheduling problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. Regrading realistic hardware requirements, we optimize the execution time of running quantum programs and the corresponding required photon lifetime to avoid fatal failures caused by photon loss. Our experiments demonstrate a $7.46\\times$ improvement on required photon lifetime and $6.82\\times$ speedup with 8 fully-connected QPUs, which further confirm the advantage of distributed quantum computing in photonic systems.

However, conventional approaches to masers fail to produce emission with embedded OAM. The recent emergence of photonic time crystals (PTCs)-artificially structured media with periodically varying electromagnetic properties in time-offers a paradigm shift toward resonance-free lasing without the need for gain media. Yet, pioneering PTC designs have been based on three-dimensional bulk structures, which lack a surface-emitting configuration, and do not possess the capability to modulate OAM, thus hindering the realization of surface-emitted PTC masing that carries OAM. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of non-resonant, gain medium-free, and surface-emitted microwave vortex beam lasing OAM using ring-shaped PTCs. By developing a multiplier-driven time-varying metamaterial that achieves over 100% equivalent permittivity modulation depth, we establish momentum bandgaps (k gaps) with sufficient bandwidth to overcome intrinsic losses and enable self-sustained coherent microwave amplification. Furthermore, space-time modulation induces non-reciprocity between clockwise and counterclockwise k gap modes within the circularly symmetric PTC structure, facilitating the selective generation of microwave lasing carrying OAM-a capability beyond the reach of conventional maser technologies. Our work bridges PTC physics with coherent OAM-carrying microwave emission, establishing a transformative platform for next-generation wireless communications, advanced sensing systems, and OAM-based technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators.

Within this reduced register, we construct a compatible variational circuit and a Gray-code-inspired measurement strategy whose number of global settings grows only logarithmically with system size. To quantify the overall hardware load, we introduce a volumetric efficiency metric that combines the number of qubit, circuit depth, and the number of measurement settings into a single measure, expressing the overall computation costs. Using this metric, we show that the total space-time-sampling volume required in a variational loop can be reduced dramatically from $N^2$ to $(logN)^3$ for hardware efficient ansatz, allowing an exponential reduction in time and size of the quantum hardware.

Using the Ising chain, we show that FTN discriminates clearly between interaction-dominated and field-dominated regimes, is systematically reshaped by temperature, and responds sensitively to the breaking of integrability. When measurements are performed on different sites, FTN reveals a characteristic spatio-temporal structure that reflects the finite-time spreading of operator incompatibility across the lattice.

Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate how such structures can be used to synthesize nearly arbitrary, even, dispersion functions within their first Brillouin zone, effectively linking nonlocal circuit parameters to prescribed dispersion profiles. Finally, we introduce time-switched nonlocal TL MTMs, a new class of metamaterials with time-varying nonlocality in which the nonlocal branches are dynamically activated as an electromagnetic pulse propagates through the structure. This platform enables complex, nearly arbitrary frequency-momentum transformations on a propagating pulse, as well as the simultaneous excitation of modes with positive, negative, and zero group velocity within the first Brillouin zone.

We explicitly construct such a term in open gravity and show that it leads to a consistent deformation of the diffeomorphism identities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u7edf\u6709\u7406\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u65bd\u74e6inger-\u5361\u5c14\u5fb7\u5951\u65af\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u5f0f\u8d85\u6d41\u4f53\u3001\u5f00\u5f0f\u9ea6\u514b\u65af\u97e6\u5c14\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5f00\u5f0f\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7834\u574f\u5148\u8fdb\u5bf9\u79f0\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f00\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u9879\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u9879\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u65bd\u74e6inger-\u5361\u5c14\u5fb7\u5951\u65af\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5f00\u7edf\u6709\u7406\u573a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u7834\u574f\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u79f0\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u5f00\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b83\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5f00\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory.

These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u70ed\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u7684 demeanor\uff0c\u5982\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6563\u9038\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u662f\u68c0\u9a8c\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u5e72\u3001\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6563\u9038\u3002", "result": "\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u70ed\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6563\u9038\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5173\u8054\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7efc\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7efc\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6563\u9038\u5728\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7efc\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Here, we report the first experimental realization of a low-loss, polarization filtering antiresonant hollow-core fiber (AR-HCF). Conventional AR-HCFs inherently support degenerate orthogonal polarization modes, making them vulnerable to polarization drift under environmental perturbations. Our dual-ring fiber design introduces polarization-selective resonant coupling to lossy cladding modes, enabling strong polarization filtering without compromising transmission efficiency. The fiber achieves a polarization extinction ratio exceeding 21 dB and a propagation loss as low as 0.15 dB m^-1 over a 10 m fiber length. The design is scalable across wavelength bands and maintains polarization discrimination under mechanical bending, making it highly suitable for applications in fiber-based gyroscopes, quantum optics, and polarization-sensitive nonlinear interactions.

Starting from the Palatini formulation of General Relativity, we recall how an equivalent Eddington-type purely affine action arises at the classical level under mild assumptions. A key feature for the non-perturbative program is that, in the pure gravity case, for a positive cosmological constant, the action is bounded below, allowing one to define a well-posed statistical ensemble of connections. We discretize this theory on a fixed hypercubic lattice and construct the corresponding partition function, including torsionful and torsionless ensembles. We provide an open C++ Monte Carlo implementation that can simulate these ensembles in arbitrary dimension, and we present proof-of-principle results in two dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper proposes a new non-perturbative quantization approach for gravity using a purely affine formulation, beginning with the Palatini formulation of General Relativity and emphasizing the boundedness of the action for positive cosmological constants.

In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).\n  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting R\u00e9nyi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured R\u00e9nyi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.\n  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u6d3e\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5b9a\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u590d\u6742\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u91cf\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5408\u6210\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e0d\u518d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(QDP)\u4e2d\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u6d3e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u6210\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4fe1\u9053\u5728\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u90fd\u662f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5b8c\u5168\u4e22\u5931\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u5e72\u51c0\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e58\u79ef\u76f8\u90bb\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u503c\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u65f6\u523b\u4f1a\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u65f6\u523b\u751f\u6210\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u635f\u5931\u91cf\u5ea6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u79cd\u91cf\u5ea6\u6ca1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u77e9\u8db3\u4ee5\u7ea6\u675f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684Renyi\u578b\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u4efb\u610f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9636\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff1a1. \u4ecb\u7ecd\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b2. \u8be6\u7ec6\u63a8\u5bfc\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cf\u5b50\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b3. \u5c55\u5f00\u5bf9\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u901a\u9053\u5408\u6210\u754c\u9650\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u901a\u9053\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u9020\u8fd9\u79cd\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u91cf\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ecf\u5178\u60f3\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ef6\u4f38\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u8bbe\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a Password \u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u660e\u786e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u653e\u677e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

By exploring the role of spectral singularities and their relationship to exceptional points, we examine how these materials, characterized by Weyl nodes and topologically protected surface states, can support novel optical phenomena such as unidirectional propagation and enhanced lasing. Through a theoretical model based on the transfer matrix approach, we reveal how the interplay between the PT symmetry and the axion term introduces new dynamics, leading to 12 distinct topological laser configurations. The study also investigates the impact of the $\u03b8$-term on spectral singularities, showing how it quantizes the system's gain values and influences the topological properties of the lasers. By applying our model to the TaAs material, a known Weyl semimetal, we uncover previously unreported effects, demonstrating the potential of PT-symmetric TWS materials for advanced optoelectronic applications. We show that the axion-induced cyclotron-like Hall current in a PT-symmetric TWS medium, revealing its topological characteristics and distinct flow patterns in the gain and loss regions, which serve as indicators of the system's topological symmetry.

Within this framework, the emergence of probabilistic parton model, thermalization in the break-up of confining strings and in high-energy collisions, and the universal small $x$ behavior of structure functions arise as direct consequences of entanglement and geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6216\u9ad8\u80fd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u7387\u6027\u3001\u70ed\u5316\u548c\u5c0fx\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u5c0fx\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u5bfc\u81f4\u51fa\u73b0\u6982\u7387\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u70ed\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5c0fx\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u7269\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Here, we report the first observation of color symmetry breaking in an integrated silicon nitride microring, where spontaneous power imbalance arises between optical mode at different wavelengths, mediated by the Kerr effect. The threshold power for this effect is as low as 19 mW. By examining the system's homogeneous states, we further demonstrate a Kerr-based nonlinear activation-function generator that produces sigmoid-, quadratic-, and leaky-ReLU-like responses.

This allows us to exploit the Josephson potential's nonlinearity, creating a motion-dependent inductance that maps gravitational displacement onto the qubit's geometric phase.

These matrices represent quantum rotations by an n-bit quantum gate. For a quantum designer, such a conventional technique requires extensive computational time and effort, which may generate an n-bit quantum gate with a too high quantum cost. The Bloch sphere is only utilized as a visualization tool to verify the conventional design correctness for quantum rotations by a quantum gate. In contrast, this paper introduces a new concept of using the Bloch sphere as a \"geometrical design tool\" to build cost-effective n-bit quantum gates with lower quantum costs. This concept is termed the \"Bloch sphere approach (BSA)\". In BSA, a cost-effective n-bit quantum gate is built without using any unitary matrices multiplication. Instead, the quantum rotations for such a gate are visually selected using the geometrical planar intersections of the Bloch sphere. The BSA can efficiently map m targets among n-m controls for an n-bit quantum gate, to satisfy the limited layout connectivity for the physical neighboring qubits of a quantum computer. Experimentally, n-bit quantum gates built using the BSA always have lower quantum costs than those for such gates built using the conventional quantum design techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Since computing this exact bound requires an intractable scan of the full Pauli basis, we introduce a Monte Carlo framework to efficiently estimate it using a tractable subset of measurement axes.

This method enables rapid comparison of quantum feature maps and early diagnosis of expressivity, allowing for the informed selection of architectures before deploying higher-complexity models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u56de\u5f52\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8ePauli\u671f\u671b\u503c\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Pauli\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u4e0a\u7531\u7ebf\u6027\u6216\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u4e0a\u9650\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u9650\u9700\u8981\u626b\u63cf\u6574\u4e2aPauli\u57fa\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f74\u5b50\u96c6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b83\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u5feb\u901f\u6bd4\u8f83\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u5e76\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u9699\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u9699\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Pauli\u671f\u671b\u503c\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u9650\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\uff1a1) \u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56de\u5f52\uff1b2) \u5728Pauli\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff1b3) \u8bc1\u660e\u6700\u4f18\u8f74\u5bf9\u9f50\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e25\u683c\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b4) \u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u6846\u67b6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b5) \u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b50\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u9ad8\u80fd\u9699-diagnostic\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u660e\u667a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8ePauli\u671f\u671b\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u4f30\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0 scalably \u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u9699\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

Such a function p from S to [0,1] is known as a numerical event or more accurately an S-probability. A set P of numerical events including the constant functions 0 and 1 and 1-p with every p in P becomes a poset when ordered by the order of real functions and can serve as a general setting for quantum logics. We call such a poset P a general set of events (GSE). The thoroughly investigated algebras of S-probabilities (including Hilbert logics), concrete logics and Boolean algebras can all be represented within this setting. In this paper we study various classes of GSEs, in particular those that are orthoposets and their interrelations and connections to known logics. Moreover, we characterize GSEs as posets by means of states and discuss the situation for GSEs to be lattices.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a general framework for quantum logics using sets of states and probabilities, explores orthoposets, and their connections to known logics, while also examining lattice structures in this setting.", "motivation": "The need for a unified framework to study probabilistic and logical structures in quantum mechanics.", "method": "Mathematical abstraction using posets, states, and probability spaces.", "result": "Characterization of GSEs as posets, conditions for being orthoposets or lattices, and connections to quantum logics.", "conclusion": "Extends quantum logic theory and provides tools for structured reasoning in quantum systems."}}
