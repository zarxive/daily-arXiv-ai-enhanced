We demonstrate how the Rowland circle geometry can be\nused as a spectropolarimeter, and apply it to the x-ray emission spectroscopy\nof spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions in LiVCuO4 and DyNiC2, respectively.\nFrom this we explore how the polarized XES interrogates of the occupied density\nof states at the valence level, either as a second order effect through Coulomb\nexchange (CtC x-ray emission) or by direct transitions (VtC x-ray emission). We\nfind that the polarized x-ray emission can provide insights into the valence\nelectron orbital occupation, in much the same way that is achievable with\npolarized absorption or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques.\nFinally, we highlight how the individually polarized dipole emission spectra\ncan be extracted from a linearly independent suite of directed emission\nspectra, allowing for polarized measurements at high Bragg angle with lower\nexperimental broadening."}

Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou\nalgorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that\nthis method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes.\nTherefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are\nboth separable. We call these \"doubly separable\" spacetimes. We identify a\nsubclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by\nexplicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in\nthese spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in\nspecialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these\nspacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that\ndoubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or\nperfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman\nfamily.

These asymmetries can arise\nat multiple levels: locally, in the dynamics of individual units, and globally,\nin the topology of their interactions. In this work, we investigate how these\ntwo forms of non-reciprocity interact in networks of neuronal populations. At\nthe local level, each population is modeled by a non-reciprocally coupled set\nof excitatory and inhibitory neural populations exhibiting transient\namplification and reactivity. At the network level, these populations are\ncoupled via directed, asymmetric connections that introduce structural\nnon-normality.

A particularly relevant challenge is to assess the quality\nof the whole computation, beyond testing the performance of each single\noperation. Here we introduce a scheme for this task that combines the target\ncomputation with variants of it, which, when averaged, allow for classically\nsolvable correlation functions. Importantly, the variants exactly preserve the\ncircuit architecture and depth, without simplifying the gates into a\nclassically-simulable set. The method is based on replacing each gate by an\nensemble of similar gates, which when averaged together form space-time\nchannels [P. Kos and G. Styliaris, Quantum 7, 1020 (2023)]. We introduce\nexplicit constructions for ensembles producing such channels, all applicable to\narbitrary brickwork circuits, and provide a general recipe to find new ones\nthrough semidefinite programming. The resulting average computation retains\nimportant information about the original circuit and is able to detect noise\nbeyond a Clifford benchmarking regime.

When should local signals dominate distant ones? A key factor\nin these processes is the precision with which cells sense each gradient, which\ndepends non-monotonically on concentrations.

We model cells as active random walkers that sense\nlocal gradients and combine these estimates to reorient their movement. Our\nresults show that cells sensing multiple gradients can display a range of\nchemotactic behaviors, including anisotropic spatial patterns and varying\ndegrees of confinement, depending on gradient shape and source location.

We uncover two new\npropagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near\nthe van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and\nlarge-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a\nsurprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for\nan IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode.\nThey can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a\nsuperfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed\nmatter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes\nin quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge\nand spin-valley physics in moir\\'e superlattices."}

Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has\nrecently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully\ncooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable\nfluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing\nof electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly\nunderstood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects\nand non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation\nof a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard\nmodels with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas\nmicroscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the\nhigh-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the\nground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data\ndemonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously\npair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing\npattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we\nreconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its\nconnection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs\nenable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double\nstripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in\nmediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration\nof multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model."}

Rotational transitions\nin H$_2$O + H$_2$O collisions are important in modeling environments rich in\nwater molecules but they are computationally intractable using quantum\nmechanical methods. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) tool using an\nensemble of neural networks (NNs) to predict cross sections to construct a\ndatabase of rate coefficients for rotationally inelastic transitions in\ncollisions of complex molecules such as water. The proposed methodology\nutilizes data computed with a mixed quantum-classical theory (MQCT). We\nillustrate that efficient ML models using NN can be built to accurately\ninterpolate in the space of 12 quantum numbers for rotational transitions in\ntwo asymmetric top molecules, spanning both initial and final states. We\nexamine various architectures of data corresponding to each collision energy,\nsymmetry of water molecule, and excitation/de-excitation rotational\ntransitions, and optimize the training/validation data sets. Using only about\n10\\% of the computed data for training, the NNs predict cross sections of\nstate-to-state rotational transitions of H$_{2}$O + H$_{2}$O collision with\naverage relative root mean square error of 0.409. Thermally averaged cross\nsections, computed using the predicted state-to-state cross sections\n($\\sim$90\\%) and the data used for training and validation ($\\sim$10\\%) were\ncompared against those obtained entirely from MQCT calculations.
