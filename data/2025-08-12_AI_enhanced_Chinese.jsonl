Indeed, most large scale\nexperiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium\ndynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general\nextremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing\npotential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed\ndifferent characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking\nand false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we\nobserve real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional\nU(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we\ndemonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string\nfragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering\nprocesses with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes.\nUtilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon\nquenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an\nextensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order\ncorrelations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly\ncorrelated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions\nbetween heavy ions.

Here we introduce\na simple spin model that realizes such a state by straightforward\ndiscretization of the higher-rank gauge theory on a square lattice. The\nsimplicity of this construction offers direct insights into the system's\nfundamental fractonic properties, such as real-space fracton configurations,\nheight-field representation of the classical ground state manifold as well as\nproperties of local and non-local fluctuations within the fracton-free\nsubspace. By sampling classical Ising states from the extensive ground state\nmanifold, we show that the effective tensor Gauss' law remains intact when\nexplicitly enforcing the spin-1/2 length constraint, demonstrating the\nexistence of a classical Ising fracton spin liquid.

We focus on four distributions: uniform (uni-uni),\npartially degree-correlated (deg-uni, uni-deg), and fully degree-correlated\n(deg-deg), where oscillators' intrinsic frequencies align with their network\nconnectivity. Through numerical and analytical investigations, we demonstrate\nthat the deg-deg distribution, where both layers employ degree-matched\nfrequencies, remarkably enhances synchronization stability, outperforming other\nconfigurations. We analyze two distinct network architectures: one composed\nentirely of nontrivial clusters and another combining trivial and nontrivial\nclusters. Results reveal that structural heterogeneity encoded in the deg-deg\ncoupling counteracts phase-lag-induced desynchronization, enabling robust\ncluster synchronization even at large phase-lag values. Stability is rigorously\nvalidated via transverse Lyapunov exponents (TLEs), which confirm that deg-deg\nnetworks exhibit broader synchronization regimes compared to uniform or\npartially correlated systems. These findings provide critical insights into the\ninterplay between topological heterogeneity and dynamical resilience, offering\na framework for designing robust multilayer systems from delay-tolerant power\ngrids to adaptive biological networks, where synchronization under phase-lag is\nparamount.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We first demonstrate that the\nsymmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit\nthe existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate\nordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave\nspin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they\nhave an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity\nspin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off\nthe time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin\nfluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the\neffect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and\nfind that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments.\nHowever, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new\nmechanism for driving incommensuration. Our results imply that odd-parity AFMs\nare likely to be preceded by an incommensurate phase, or emerge directly from\nthe normal state via a first order transition.

To understand such electrostatically-driven\nsolvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a\nsolvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in\nclassic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in\nsimulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded\npoint charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to\nsingular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a\nrealistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields\nits embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However,\nthis core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent\ndensity that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In\nthis work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed\ntest charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted\nanywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite\nenergies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations\nin the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is\nlinear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for\nsolvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian\ncharges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the\ntheories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian\ntest charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric\nresponse in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically\npredict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar\nsolutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While existing robust protocols often require precise\nnoise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum\ncontrol that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental\nnoise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical\nmodification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an\neffect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation.

It is not easy to develop a\ncoherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard\nGeneral Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of\nthe very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm\nbasis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which\nInflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\\,$ this, of course, includes the\nvast majority of such theories -- $\\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that\nspacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is\ncompletely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the\n``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be\nconfirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from\nthe outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly\nmetric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far\nthe most natural way to accommodate such observations.

It is shown that the standard approach to apply dephasing is\nill-defined in the presence of band crossings and leads to artifacts in the\ncarrier distribution. They are caused by rapid changes of the dephasing\noperator matrix elements in the Wannier gauge, which render the convergence of\nthe simulation in the stationary basis infeasible.

The results show that, compared to Sgr A*, the observational data of\nM87* impose stronger constraints on the charge parameter Q and the\nLorentz-violating parameter G. Under the thin accretion disk model, a larger\nobserver inclination theta_o deforms the inner shadow into a hat-like\nstructure. The parameters (a, Q, G) mainly affect the size of the inner shadow\nand the brightness of the critical curve, where increasing these parameters\nreduces the shadow size and enhances the distinguishability of the critical\ncurve. In the retrograde accretion disk case, the gravitational redshift\nsignificantly reduces the observed brightness of the image. In addition, we\ncompute the distribution of the redshift factor on the projection screen. The\nresults indicate that the Doppler effect induced by large theta_o enhances the\nblueshift in the image, while the light emitted by particles plunging into the\nblack hole leads to strong redshift near the inner shadow. Finally, we study\nthe polarization images under synchrotron radiation and find that the\npolarization intensity P_o reaches its maximum around the lensed image and\nhigher-order images, whereas no polarization vectors appear within the inner\nshadow. This stands in sharp contrast to horizonless compact objects. These\nfindings contribute to a deeper understanding of the shadow properties of\ncharged black holes within Lorentz-violating gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684Kalu-Ramond\uff08KR\uff09\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u90fd\u8584\u7684\u7ed5\u5c04\u76d8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0eSgr A*\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cM87*\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u53c2\u6570Q\u548c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u53c2\u6570G\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5728\u8584\u7ed5\u5c04\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u4ef0\u89d2\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u03b8_o\u4f1a\u5c06\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u53d8\u5f62\u4e3a\u5e3d\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u53c2\u6570\uff08a, Q, G\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u4e34\u754c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u4f7f\u9634\u5f71\u53d8\u5c0f\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u754c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u7ed5\u5c04\u76d8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u529b\u7ea2\u79fb\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4eae\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u7ea2\u79fb\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u03b8_o\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u84dd\u79fb\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u84dd\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5149\u5728\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u9644\u8fd1\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u7ea2\u79fb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6781\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6781\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6P_o\u5728\u5176\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e00\u9636\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u503c\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u90e8\u9634\u5f71\u533a\u57df\u5185\u6ca1\u6709\u6781\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6d89\u53ca\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9ed1\u8272\u5b54\u6d1e\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u548c\u5f15\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7ed5\u5c04\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Kalu-Ramond\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9634\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0eSgr A*\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cM87*\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u7535\u8377\u53c2\u6570Q\u548c\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u53c2\u6570G\u65bd\u52a0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5927\u89d2\u5ea6\u03b8_o\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5185\u9634\u5f71\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u4eae\u5ea6\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c0f\u9634\u5f71\u5927\u5c0f\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u754c\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002\u53cd\u5411\u7ed5\u5c04\u76d8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f15\u529b\u7ea2\u79fb\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4eae\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0b\uff0c\u6781\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6P_o\u5728\u5176\u504f\u632f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e00\u9636\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u9634\u5f71\u5185\u65e0\u6781\u5316\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u8377\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u7834\u574f\u5f15\u529b\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

This field-tailored phase exhibits a\nshortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed\nmagnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition.\nElectrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders\nof magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial\nenhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a\nhighly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that\nthe field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy,\nunderscoring its metastable nature.

At any radius, the string\npreserves a subgroup of AdS isometries equivalent to the one-dimensional\nconformal group and hence, from the boundary point of view, can be thought of\nas a conformal defect.

When the\nequation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact\nsolutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is\nembedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known\nMcVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends\non the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with\nthe expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or\nduring inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the\nsupermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes\nsuggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the\ncosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters\nthe epoch of finite-time future singularity.

It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the\ntidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended\nobject, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.\n  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside\nthe black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the\nspherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon,\nit becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the\nradius of the singularity becomes infinite.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e3a\u4eba\u77e5\u7684McVittie\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u9ed1\u6d1e\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\u800c\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u8d85\u5927\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u8d77\u6e90\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u6d89\u53ca\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5947\u70b9\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5947\u70b9\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6784\u5efa\u5728\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u3001\u8d85\u7ea7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u5947\u70b9\u6709\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u5e26\u6709\u5b87\u5b99\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684McVittie\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89e3\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u76f8\u534f\u548c\u8c10\u3002\u6b64\u89e3\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u8d85\u5927\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5149\u7ebf\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u73b0\u8c61\u3001\u8d85\u7ea7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u5b87\u5b99\u7ec8\u7ed3\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5947\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u5468\u671f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

The quantum-corrected metric is obtained\nperturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity\nbetween the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal\nGauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this\nmetric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute\nthe associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular\nseparation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum\nhair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the\nnonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong\ndeflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the\nangular separation decreases.

As a result, we\ndemonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but\nalso its strong gravitational lensing effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7Barvinsky-Vilkovisky\u5f62\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u7b26\u4e0e\u534f\u53d8\u5bfc\u6570\u53ef\u4ea4\u6362\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af-\u535a\u5185\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f3a\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89d2\u3001\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u589e\u76ca\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u589e\u76ca\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u89d2\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u5bf9\u5f31\u548c\u5f3a\u6bdb\u72b6\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u754c\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u6df1\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u5ea6\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53ca\u5176\u5149\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Barvinsky-Vilkovisky\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u6b8a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u91cf\u5b50\u4fee\u6b63\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f3a\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u504f\u89d2\u3001\u7126\u8ddd\u548c\u589e\u76ca\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5149\u7403\u534a\u5f84\u3001\u5f3a\u6027\u504f\u89d2\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u589e\u76ca\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u89d2\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5176\u5f3a\u6027\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6bdb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u9ed1\u6d1e\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5f3a\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

We\nanalyze the behavior of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector following such a\ntrajectory and explore the dependence of complete positivity (CP) divisibility\non the detector's frequency, acceleration, and the duration of acceleration.\nNotably, we find that the detector exhibits a memory effect due to the finite\nduration of acceleration, which is also quantified by the Fisher information.\nWe further examine two UDW detectors along various trajectory combinations and\nshow that, unlike the transition rate, both the total correlation and the\nentanglement harvested return smoothly to their initial values after the\nacceleration/deceleration phase. These correlation measures behave similarly in\nboth accelerating and decelerating segments. Interestingly, negativity and\nmutual information remain unaffected by the memory effect.

QVNTVS simulates QWs\nby solving the Time-Independent Schr\\\"odinger Equation for different potential\nprofiles in a discretized space using the finite-difference method and computes\nthe properties of the device using the extracted information from the solution.\nThe results align with the analytical calculations and the experimental data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u5728LED\u548c\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5230QVNTVS\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u5b9a\u6001\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u5792\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7c92\u5b50\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5bf9\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u7279\u6027\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u5b9a\u6001\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u5f97\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u7684\u80fd\u7ea7\u548c\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u53ca\u5176\u5b83\u76f8\u5173\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u5168\u9762\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177QVNTVS\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u91cf\u5b50\u9631\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the feasibility of applying QLS algorithms\nto solve discretized three-dimensional heterogeneous Poisson equations, with\nspecific examples relating to groundwater flow through geologic fracture\nnetworks. We explicitly construct a block encoding for the 3D heterogeneous\nPoisson matrix by leveraging the sparse local structure of the discretized\noperator. While classical solvers benefit from preconditioning, we show that\nblock encoding the system matrix and preconditioner separately does not improve\nthe effective condition number that dominates the QLS runtime.

Here, we present a\nsufficient criterion for metrological schemes to saturate the quantum\nCram\\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) using local measurements, based on stabilizer\nformalism. In ideal settings, we show that graph states always admit local\nestimation protocols with an optimal estimation precision determined only by\nthe underlying graph structure. A family of graph states is identified as probe\nstates that achieve suboptimal precision scaling. In noisy environments, we\nconstruct several subspaces of probe states (mixed in general) that not only\nsaturate the QCRB with local measurements but also maintain approximately\ninvariant precision scaling.

In a semiconductor laser, squeezing\nto below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity\nand it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to\nsqueezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but\noften the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier.\nAt the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the\nHeisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a\nquantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise\nsqueezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area.

These protocols use a multi-objective machine design approach that\nincorporates dominant sources of error in the design to ensure the solutions\nare compatible with existing fast laser controls. We also generalize previous\nschemes by allowing for unpaired pulses during the gate evolution. By imposing\nsymmetries on the pulse sequences, we eliminate susceptibility to laser phase\nnoise and further simplify the multi-mode control over the state-dependent\nmotion of the ion crystal. We perform a comprehensive analysis of expected gate\nperformance in the presence of random and systematic experimental errors to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of performing microsecond two-qubit gates between\narbitrary ion pairs in current linear ion-trap processors of up to $50$ ions\nwith fidelities approaching $99.9\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces advanced gate search techniques for trapped-ion systems that enhance gate performance and flexibility while addressing laser control challenges.

However, recent advances in quantum\nmetrology have led to the quantum superresolution technique that can break\nRayleigh's curse and estimate the separation between a pair of incoherent point\nsources with nonvanishing precision. For two-dimensional optical systems, the\nprecision limit of estimating the whole separation, i.e., the distance, between\ntwo point sources remains unknown so far. In this paper, we investigate the\nestimation precision of the distance between two incoherent point sources with\narbitrary intensities in a two-dimensional imaging system. Through the\nmultiparameter quantum estimation theory, we obtain the ultimate estimation\nprecision of the distance and show that it remains nonzero when the distance\napproaches zero, which surpasses the Rayleigh criterion. We further show that\nthe precision can be enhanced by aligning the two point sources along specific\ndirections if the point-spread functions of the two sources are not circularly\nsymmetric, and find the optimial relative azimuth between the two point sources\nand the highest estimation precision of the distance. In addition to the\ndistance estimation, we also consider the quantum estimation of the relative\nazimuth between two incoherent point sources. A surprising result is that the\nprecision limit of the azimuth decays quadratically with the distance, which\nsuggests that the azimuth cannot be resolved when the two point sources get\nsufficiently close to each other and is therefore inaccessible by the quantum\nsuperresolution technique in this case. This reveals a new and fundamental\nlimitation on the resolvability of two incoherent point sources in\nmulti-dimensional quantum imaging which cannot be addressed by optimizing the\nquantum measurements.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a quantum superresolution technique that surpasses the Rayleigh criterion for two-dimensional imaging, achieving subdiffractional resolution by estimating the separation between two point sources with non-zero precision even when they are infinitesimally close. The study demonstrates that alignment of point sources along specific directions and precise measurement techniques can enhance estimation accuracy. However, it also reveals a limitation where the relative azimuth's resolution degrades quadratically as the sources come closer, indicating a fundamental limit in resolving their orientation when they are too close.", "motivation": "This paper seems to push the boundaries of optical imaging by leveraging quantum metrology to overcome the classical Rayleigh limit, particularly in two-dimensional systems. The premise is intriguing as it suggests that quantum mechanics can offer a way to achieve super-resolution beyond the traditional constraints, which could have significant implications for fields like medical imaging, astronomy, and microscopy.", "method": "The authors use multiparameter quantum estimation theory to analyze the precision limits of distance and relative azimuth measurements between two incoherent point sources. They likely derive mathematical models or use Fisher information matrices to compute the ultimate estimation precision for the distance and azimuth angles.

They also show how alignment can enhance precision, but they identify a quadratic decay in the resolution of the relative azimuth when sources are too close, indicating a fundamental limit in estimating their orientation.", "conclusion": "This work opens new avenues for quantum-assisted optical imaging by demonstrating that quantum super-resolution is possible in two-dimensional systems. However, it also reveals essential limitations in estimating multiple parameters simultaneously, highlighting the need for further research to overcome these constraints and perhaps employing hybrid quantum-classical methods for more comprehensive parameter estimation."}}

We provide a complete derivation and a\ndetailed description of the combined EF and SQD approach, and we assess its\naccuracy across active spaces of varying sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Reader's guide included", "summary": "Proving threshold theorems for fault-tolerant quantum computation is a\nburdensome endeavor with many moving parts that come together in relatively\nformulaic but lengthy ways. It is difficult and rare to combine elements from\nmultiple papers into a single formal threshold proof, due to the use of\ndifferent measures of fault-tolerance. In this work, we introduce composable\nfault-tolerance, a framework that decouples the probabilistic analysis of the\nnoise distribution from the combinatorial analysis of circuit correctness, and\nenables threshold proofs to compose independently analyzed gadgets easily and\nrigorously. Within this framework, we provide a library of standard and\ncommonly used gadgets such as memory and logic implemented by constant-depth\ncircuits for quantum low-density parity check codes and distillation. As sample\napplications, we explicitly write down a threshold proof for computation with\nsurface code and re-derive the constant space-overhead fault-tolerant scheme of\nGottesman using gadgets from this library. We expect that future\nfault-tolerance proofs may focus on the analysis of novel techniques while\nleaving the standard components to the composable fault-tolerance framework,\nwith the formal proof following the intuitive ``napkin math'' exactly.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper introduces composable fault-tolerance as a framework for proving threshold theorems in quantum computing, allowing modular and rigorous threshold proofs by composing gadgets without needing complex probabilistic noise models.
