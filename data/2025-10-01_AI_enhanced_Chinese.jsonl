The measured energy resolution at 662 keV was 8.17% for GAGG,\n9.3% for YSO, and 10.2% for BGO, consistent with their light yield and photon\ndetection efficiency (PDE) - matching characteristics.

It has traditionally been\nconfined to specific domains: terahertz, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet,\neach requiring distinct comb sources and detection mechanisms tailored to the\nnature of the spectroscopic target. Yet, similar techniques may be implemented\nin the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical\nrectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection,\nboth using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen\nband near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz,\nboth linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high\ndispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed. This confines DCS\noperation to spectral regions either below or above the Reststrahlen band and\neffectively separating the THz and MIR domains.

We stress that one should interpret\nsuch a running as a scale-dependence of the cosmological parameters and\nfundamental constants at the same time rather than a time dependence, as it is\nusually considered in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper proposes that the Hubble tension results from scale-dependent variations of the Newton constant and the cosmological constant.", "motivation": "Exploring why the Hubble constant measured by different methods differs and potential implications for cosmology.", "method": "Theoretical analysis of scale-running of G and Lambda, comparing observations from CMB and Supernovae.", "result": "Suggests that considering scale dependence of fundamental constants explains the Hubble tension.", "conclusion": "The observed Hubble tension may stem from varying G and Lambda at different cosmological scales."}}

However, the\nnarrow instantaneous bandwidth of the MW receiver limits its applications.\nImproving the instantaneous bandwidth of the receiver is an ongoing challenge.\nHere, we report on the achievement of an arbitrary instantaneous bandwidth MW\nreceiver via a linear array of scalable Rydberg vapor cells with Stark comb,\nwhere the Stark comb consists of an MW frequency comb (MFC) and a\nposition-dependent Stark field. In the presence of the Stark field, the\nresonance MW transition frequency between two Rydberg states is position\ndependent, so that we can make each MFC line act as a local oscillator (LO)\nfield to resonantly couple one Rydberg cell. Thus, each cell receives part of a\nbroadband MW signal within its instantaneous bandwidth using atomic heterodyne\ndetection, achieving the measurements of the broadband MW signal\nsimultaneously. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate the MW\nreceiver with 210~MHz instantaneous bandwidth using an MFC field with 21 lines.\nMeanwhile, we achieve an overall sensitivity of 326.6~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$.\nIn principle, the method allows for achieving an arbitrary instantaneous\nbandwidth of the receiver, provided we have enough MFC lines with enough power.\nOur work paves the way to design and develop a scalable MW receiver for\napplications in radar, communication, and spectrum monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cd \uce21 Quantifier \u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u77ac\u65f6\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1, \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u6ce2\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u9635\u5217\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u91cd \uce21 Quantifier \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u77ac\u65f6\u5e26\u5bbd\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u63a5\u6536\u5230,\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u573a\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9a6c\u8d6b-\u5eb7\u6258\u7f57\u7c73\u65af\u9891\u8c31\u7ebf\u7ec4\u6210\u4e86 \u0441\u0442\u00e1k combs\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u8be5\u5fae\u6ce2\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u5e26\u5bbd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86210~MHz,\u6574\u4f53\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e3a326.6~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5fae\u6ce2\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the\ninterpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles\nremains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of\norbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons\nand phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in\nbosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion\nof the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the\nlatter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional\nantiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum\ngeometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking,\nyielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM.\nWe propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage\ngenerated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the\nbosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the\nemerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge\nbetween phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding\nmagnon-polarons.

PC-DEER\nextends photocurrent NV readout from single-spin to spin-bath control and\ncoherent manipulation, enabling characterization of bath-induced noise and\neffective deployment of noise-reduction protocols.

Using GATE, serial dilutions from 1.0 uCi down to 1e-6 uCi were\nsimulated, activities were reconstructed from the 218 and 440 keV gamma peaks\nand performance was compared against a NaI(Tl) well counter, which serves as an\nalternative to standard dose calibrator. Across six orders of magnitude, the\nCZT-based micro-activity dose calibrator exhibited near-unity linearity (slope\nm=0.9934) with percent-level bias, whereas the NaI(Tl) counter showed\nsystematic under-response under identical conditions. These results indicate\nthat a CZT-based approach can provide accurate low-activity quantification for\nTAT, motivating forthcoming hardware validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The amplitudes are computed in\nthe angular momentum basis, appropriate to the representations of $SO(1,4)$ de\nSitter symmetry group. We discuss the properties of wavefunctions in\nBunch-Davies vacuum and derive a new integral representation for the Feynman\npropagator. We focus on deep infrared processes probing the large scale\nstructure of spacetime, in particular on the processes that are normally\nforbidden by the energy-momentum conservation laws in flat spacetime. We find\nthat there are no stable particles in self-interacting scalar field theory, but\nthe decay rates are exponentially suppressed for particles with masses far\nabove $\\hbar/c\\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the de Sitter radius.

Assuming each pair of qubits\ninteracts with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ strength, time-dependent all-to-all Hamiltonians\ncan simulate arbitrary all-to-all quantum circuits, performing quantum\ncomputation in time proportional to the circuit depth. We show that this naive\ncorrespondence is far from optimal: all-to-all Hamiltonians can process\ninformation on much shorter timescales.\n  First, we prove that any two-qubit gate can be simulated by all-to-all\nHamiltonians on $N$ qubits in time $\\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ (up to factor $N^{\\delta}$\nwith an arbitrarily small constant $\\delta>0$), with polynomially small error\n$1/\\mathrm{poly}(N)$. Immediate consequences include: 1) Certain\n$\\mathrm{O}(N)$-qubit unitaries and entangled states, such as the\nmultiply-controlled Toffoli gate and the GHZ and W states, can be generated in\n$\\mathrm{O}(1/N)$ time; 2) Trading space for time, any quantum circuit can be\nsimulated in arbitrarily short time; 3) Information could propagate in a fast\nway that saturates known Lieb-Robinson bounds in strongly power-law interacting\nsystems.\n  Our second main result proves that any depth-$D$ quantum circuit can be\nsimulated by a randomized Hamiltonian protocol in time\n$T=\\mathrm{O}(D/\\sqrt{N})$, with constant space overhead and polynomially small\nerror.\n  The techniques underlying our results depart fundamentally from the existing\nliterature on parallelizing commuting gates: We rely crucially on non-commuting\nHamiltonians and draw on diverse physical ideas.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper demonstrates that all-to-all Hamiltonians provide a highly efficient method for simulating quantum circuits, significantly outperforming traditional methods by factors related to circuit depth and system size.", "motivation": "Understanding and enhancing the information-processing capabilities of quantum systems through all-to-all interactions is a key objective in both theoretical and experimental quantum physics.", "method": "The authors introduce a systematic approach using all-to-all Hamiltonians, achieving faster simulation times by exploiting non-commuting Hamiltonians and diverse physical concepts.", "result": "The study reveals that all-to-all Hamiltonians enable quantum computations to be completed in much shorter timescales compared to conventional methods, particularly when considering system size and circuit depth.", "conclusion": "This research extends our understanding of quantum circuit simulation, highlighting the potential of all-to-all interactions in advancing quantum computing technologies."}}

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and\nquantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a\none-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field\napproach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is\nsimultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard\ninteraction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from\nan anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This\nmagnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a\nquantized jump in the Zak phase from $\\pm\\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute\nthe phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering\n($\\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\\lambda$), revealing the\ncritical interaction strength $U_c$. Furthermore, we analyze the quantum\ngeometry of the Bloch states by calculating the Fubini-Study metric,\ndemonstrating that its components exhibit divergences that precisely signal the\ntopological phase transition. By analyzing the full energy spectrum, we\ndistinguish the true ground state from metastable excited states that emerge\npast the critical point.

For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\\odot}$, the\ntidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither\ncan the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption.\nSince NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's\nmaterial can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant\nobserver. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the\ndisrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption\nevent. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have\nimplications for the heavy elements in the universe.

The next generations of astrometric\nfacilities are aiming at the sub-micro-arcsecond scale. Sub-micro-arcsecond\nastrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light\npropagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is\nindispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the\npost-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some\nsolar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light\nsource as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the\ngravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value\nproblem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by\nthe spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past\ninfinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical\nrelativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the\ndetermination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the\nspatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several\nbasic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one\nto calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar\nsystem bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for\nstellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system.\nNumerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole\nand quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the\ngiant planets. The model GREM is presently used for data reduction of the ESA\nastrometry mission Gaia.

The integrands constructed by this approach have two closely\nrelated features that are different from conventional Feynman diagrams. First,\nthe denominators of loop propagators are linear functions of the loop momentum.\nSecond, the local vertex expression is not manifest. In our previous work, a\nsystematic approach was proposed to handle the nonlocal terms in the one-loop\nintegrand of Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) theory. Upon canceling the nonlocalities,\nquadratic propagator forms of both YMS and Yang-Mills (YM) integrands are\nnaturally obtained. In this paper, we generalize the calculation to theories\ninvolving gravitons by introducing the one-loop double Yang-Mills-scalar (dYMS)\nintegrands. The cancellation of the nonlocalities of the dYMS integrand in the\nforward limit coincides with the emergence of local multi-point vertices. We\nprovide two equivalent methods for extracting the vertices and give the final\nexpression of the dYMS integrand with quadratic propagators. In this formula,\ntree-level effective subcurrents, which exhibit double-copy structures, are\nattached to the loop propagator line via the local vertices constructed. The\nquadratic propagator formulas for Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) and gravity (GR)\nintegrands are further derived, by the help of the formula for dYMS. The\nextraction of local vertices in one-loop dYMS integrand also applies at\ntree-level, thus we have the corresponding expressions of tree-level dYMS, EYM,\nand GR amplitudes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4e00\u73afn\u70b9\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a(n+2)\u70b9\u524d\u5411\u6781\u9650\u53cc\u6807\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u6811\u7ea7\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u5206\u6bcd\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u73af\u52a8\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5c40\u90e8\u9876\u70b9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u3002\u524d\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8be5\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u73af\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u79ef\u5206\u9879\uff0c\u5728YM-\u6807\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5305\u542b\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u73af\u53ccYM-\u6807\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u524d\u5411\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6d88\u9664\u73b0\u8c61\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5c40Vertices\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u516c\u5f0f\u5f97\u5230\u4e86GR\u548cEYM\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6811\u7ea7\u540c\u6837\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u6709 promise\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40Vertices\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u8868\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u73af\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u524d\u5411\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u8868\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u73afn\u70b9\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a(n+2)\u70b9\u524d\u5411\u6781\u9650\u53cc\u6807\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u6811\u7ea7\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5c40Vertices\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f20\u64ad\u5b50\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u73af\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6811\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4e00\u73af\u53cc\u6807\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u6811\u7ea7\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u524d\u5411\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u5c40Vertices\u7684\u591a\u70b9\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u73af\u79ef\u5206\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u9ad8\u73af\u6b21\u79ef\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u73afEYM\u548cGR\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6811\u7ea7\u540c\u6837\u8d77\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c40Vertices\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4e00\u73af\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u79ef\u5206\u6d88\u9664\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5c40Vertices\u7684\u591a\u70b9\u79ef\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u5c40\u8868\u9762\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e5f\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u79ef\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter\nprovides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the\nevolution of the Poincar\\'e section. Further we perform an independent spectral\nanalysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level\nspace distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe\na clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble\n(GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a\nflow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We\nquantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory\nby computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the\ninformation scrambling, inside the bulk.

As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can\nbe balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice.\nEven below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge\nto solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting\nguess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u7ec8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eprimordial black hole\u5f62\u6210\u548cinflation\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u524d\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u5766\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u89e3\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u5982\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u552f\u4e00\u3002\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u652f\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u5f3a\u573a\u548c\u5f31\u573a\u89e3\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u89e3\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u5185\u5728\u800c\u975e\u5916\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u65f6\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6b64\u9650\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u9020\u521d\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4efb\u4e00\u652f\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4 evolved \u65f6\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bf9primordial black hole\u5f62\u6210\u548cinflation\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u542f\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u91cd\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u4e0d\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3primordial black hole\u5f62\u6210\u548cinflation\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The construction\nproceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th\nminimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction\nterm has scaling dimension $2-\\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new\nclass of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the\nresulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\\delta$, can be studied using\ntwo perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the\nmean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range\ncrossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared\nduality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We\nfind that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes,\nhence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for\nall values of $m$. For the models based on $\\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is\nrather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it\nis well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely\nmany anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained\nfrom both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out\nconformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models,\nthese can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators.\nThis method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal\nperturbation theory which were previously only known numerically.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

For a range\nof local Hamiltonian families, this problem is (promise) BQP-hard, though for\nstoquastic Hamiltonians, the complexity was previously unknown. Our results are\nachieved by first reducing from quantum-inspired BPP circuits to 6-local\nstoquastic Hamiltonians. We prove particular classes of quantum states, known\nas semi-classical encoded subset states, can guide the estimation of the ground\nstate energy. Subsequent analysis shows the BPP-hardness is not dependent on\nthe locality, i.e., the result holds for 2-local stoquastic Hamiltonians.\nAdditional arguments further the BPP-hardness to Hamiltonians restricted to a\nsquare lattice.

In\nthis paper we analyze the effects of an eavesdropper's variable-strength\nmeasurements on QKD. Two types of measurements have been considered: (i) a\nprobe-based model, commonly referred to as a \"weak measurement\", in which each\nqubit is weakly coupled to a continuous variable probe which is later\nprojectively measured (ii) a probeless model, usually referred to as a \"partial\nmeasurement\", where only a small (tunable) part of all transmitted photons is\nprojectively measured and the rest are transmitted with no disturbance. The\ninformation gain of the eavesdropper and the quantum-bit-error-rate (QBER) are\ncomputed for each case. An experimental realization of an intercept-and-resend\nattack based on variable-strength partial measurements is demonstrated in a\ntime-bin-encoded, fiber-based simplified Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol,\nwhich is compatible with data centers. It is shown that the measured\ninformation gain and QBER follow the theoretical curves across the full\ncoupling range, validating the partial-measurement model and clarifying its\nrelation to the well-known monitoring channel.

However, experimental implementation of such a nonreciprocal\nSQPT remains challenging. This motivates the search for new mechanisms capable\nof producing a nonreciprocal SQPT. Here, we propose an alternative approach to\nrealize a nonreciprocal SQPT, induced by the magnon Kerr effect (MKE), in a\ncavity magnonic system, where magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are\ncoupled to cavity photons. The Kerr coefficient $K$ is positive (negative),\ni.e., $K>0$ ($K<0$), when the bias magnetic field is aligned along the\ncrystallographic axis [100] ([110]) of the YIG sphere. We show that the\nsteady-state phase diagrams differ significantly for both cases with $K > 0$\nand $K < 0$, which is the origin of the nonreciprocal SQPT. By further studying\nthe steady-state magnon occupation and its fluctuations versus the parametric\ndrive strength, we demonstrate that the SQPT becomes nonreciprocal,\ncharacterized by distinct critical thresholds for $K > 0$ and $K < 0$.\nMoreover, we introduce a bidirectional contrast ratio to quantify this\nnonreciprocal behavior.

However, in this scheme, since the signal and the LO are generated\nby different lasers and the signal propagates through the untrusted quantum\nchannel, their pulse widths may become mismatched. Such mismatches may reduce\nthe precision of detection at Bob, affecting parameter estimation processes and\nleading to inaccurate calculations of the secret key rate. Moreover, mismatches\nmay introduce potential security loopholes. Thus, this paper investigates the\npractical security issues of the LLO-CVQKD system when pulse width mismatch\noccurs between the local oscillator and the signal. We first model the case of\npulse width mismatch and analyze its impact on Bob's detection. Then, we\nsimulate the secret key rate under different mismatch levels. Based on the\nanalysis, we find that under such mismatch, the key parameters involved in\nsecret key rate calculation are incorrectly estimated, leading to an\noverestimation of the system's secret key rate. Therefore, this imperfect\nmismatch can open a loophole for Eve to perform attacks in practical systems.\nTo close this loophole, we design a scheme at Bob to monitor the pulse widths\nof both the signal and the local oscillator, and to reshape the waveform of the\nlocal oscillator so that the two lights are matched again. This method\neliminates the adverse effects caused by pulse width mismatch and effectively\nresists Eve's attacks which exploit this loophole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u62e5\u6324\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u5e03\uff08CVQKD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u5730\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff08LLO\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u672c\u5730\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4fe1\u9053\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u9c8d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4fe1\u9053\u6cc4\u9732\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u4e14\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5176\u8109\u5bbd\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u9c8d\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f7f\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8109\u5bbd\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLO-CVQKD\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u8109\u5bbd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8109\u5bbd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u9c8d\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5bc6\u94a5\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u8bef\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bc6\u94a5\u901f\u7387\u8fc7\u9ad8\u88ab\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u4f1a\u4e3a\u7231 Dee\uff08Eve\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e00\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u653b\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5728\u9c8d\u7aef\u76d1\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u632f\u8361\u5668\u8109\u5bbd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u672c\u5730\u632f\u8361\u5668\u6ce2\u5f62\u4ee5\u4f7f\u4e8c\u8005\u518d\u6b21\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u8109\u5bbd\u504f\u5dee\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5229\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u7231 Dee\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55,\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\uff08QKD\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf,\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b,\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u534f\u8bae\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5206\u6790\u5bb9\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u6cc4\u9732\u673a\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u635f\u8017\u8d44\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u57df\u632f\u8361\u5668\uff08LLO\uff09\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u578bLLO-CVQKD\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u9ad8\u4fe1\u9053\u6cc4\u9732\u4e0b\u7684\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u4e0e\u635f\u8017\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u5747\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4fe1\u9053\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u6539\u826f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u57df\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5339\u914d\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u5bc6\u94a5\u5206\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u57df\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f97\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5c40\u57df\u632f\u8361\u5668\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5339\u914d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This idealization raises fundamental\nconcerns about their practical utility, especially given the limited\navailability of quantum hardware in the near term. To unleash the power of\nthese DL-based models, we propose AiDE-Q (\\underline{a}utomat\\underline{i}c\n\\underline{d}ata \\underline{e}ngine for \\underline{q}uantum property\nestimation), an effective framework that addresses this challenge by\niteratively generating high-quality synthetic labeled datasets. Specifically,\nAiDE-Q utilizes a consistency-check method to assess the quality of synthetic\nlabels and continuously improves the employed DL models with the identified\nhigh-quality synthetic dataset. To verify the effectiveness of AiDE-Q, we\nconduct extensive numerical simulations on a diverse set of quantum many-body\nand molecular systems, with up to 50 qubits. The results show that AiDE-Q\nenhances prediction performance for various reference learning models, with\nimprovements of up to $14.2\\%$.

Using this\nsetup, we investigate the behavior of Majorana zero modes at the interface\nbetween the two segments, finding that in the decoupled case, Majorana zero\nmodes remain sharply localized at the left segment chain edges while massive\nDirac modes remain in right segment chain edges, with their energies and\nlocalization strongly dependent on the long-range pairing exponent. Introducing\na finite interface coupling enables coherent transfer of Majorana zero modes\nfrom the edges of the left segment to those of the right segment of the chain.\nWe characterize this dynamics by the fidelity of state transfer, dynamical\nrotation, and inverse participation ratio.

Consequently, the mathematical lower edge of the correlation bound\nis not physically attainable, which we interpret as a unitary-geometric floor\non anti-contrast, independent of hardware specifics and noise models.

To address this challenge, we introduce the Stabilizer-QRAM\n(Stab-QRAM), a domain-specific architecture tailored for data with an affine\nBoolean structure ($f(\\mathbf{x}) = A\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$ over\n$\\mathbb{F}_2$), a class of functions vital for optimization, time-series\nanalysis, and quantum linear systems algorithms. We demonstrate that the gate\ninteractions required to implement the matrix $A$ form a bipartite graph. By\napplying K\\\"{o}nig's edge-coloring theorem to this graph, we prove that\nStab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth of $O(\\log N)$ for $N$ data\nitems, matching its $O(\\log N)$ space complexity. Critically, the Stab-QRAM is\nconstructed exclusively from Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero\n$T$-count. This design completely circumvents the non-Clifford bottleneck,\neliminating the need for costly magic state distillation and making it\nexceptionally suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. We\nhighlight Stab-QRAM's utility as a resource-efficient oracle for applications\nin discrete dynamical systems, and as a core component in Quantum Linear\nSystems Algorithms, providing a practical pathway for executing data-intensive\ntasks on emerging quantum hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "A novel domain-specific architecture called Stabilizer-QRAM (Stab-QRAM) is introduced to alleviate the heavy reliance on non-Clifford gates in quantum random access memories (QRAMs). The architecture is designed specifically for data with an affine Boolean structure and achieves optimal logical circuit depth and space complexity using only Clifford gates. This results in a zero T-count, effectively eliminating the non-Clifford gate bottleneck.", "motivation": "The increasing demand for data-intensive quantum algorithms has led to the development of QRAMs. However, the reliance on non-Clifford gates poses a significant challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computing. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a specialized architecture for data with affine Boolean structures, offering a solution that minimizes the use of expensive non-Clifford gates.", "method": "The authors demonstrate that the gate interactions for implementing matrix A form a bipartite graph. By applying K\u00f6nig's edge-coloring theorem, they derive optimal logical circuit depth and space complexity for Stab-QRAM. The architecture exclusively uses Clifford gates (CNOT and X), resulting in a zero T-count.", "result": "Stab-QRAM achieves an optimal logical circuit depth and space complexity of O(log N) for N data items. By avoiding non-Clifford gates, it completely circumvents the associated costs, making it highly suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms. The paper highlights its applications in discrete dynamical systems and Quantum Linear Systems Algorithms.", "conclusion": "Stab-QRAM represents a significant advancement in QRAM design by addressing the non-Clifford gate bottleneck. Through its efficient use of Clifford gates, it provides a practical solution for implementing data-intensive quantum algorithms on emerging quantum hardware."}}

After\npresenting this result in a more detailed way, reinforcing its topological\nnature, we study the magnetic and electric versions of the AB effect in\ndifferent inertial reference frames. We find a particular reference frame for a\nmagnetic AB effect where the magnetic flux has a null contribution for the AB\nphase difference, which is entirely due to an electric flux. Also, we find a\nparticular reference frame for an electric AB effect where the electric flux\nhas a null contribution for the AB phase difference, which is entirely due to a\nmagnetic flux. In this sense, the nomenclatures 'magnetic AB effect' and\n'electric AB effect' lose their meaning.
