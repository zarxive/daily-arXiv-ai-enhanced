This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid\nsurface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated,\ncondensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of\nwetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and\ndiffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical\nunderpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key\nphenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from\nasymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid\npenetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to\nchanges in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous)\nrotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to\ndepend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's\ncharacteristic capsid shape.", "AI": {"tldr": "HIV capsid surpasses passive diffusion threshold via surface properties and physical mechanisms in nucleus.", "motivation": "Understanding HIV nuclear entry is critical for developing treatments and vaccines, especially since HIV's unique entry mechanism challenges conventional diffusion models.", "method": "Applied principles of capillarity and wetting, along with numerical simulations to model HIV capsid movement within the nucleus.", "result": "HIV capsid geometry plays a critical role in its ability to overcome the nuclear pore complex via mechanisms involving surface interactions, capillary forces, and reorientation during insertion.", "conclusion": "The physical properties of the HIV capsid, particularly its geometry, provide a foundation for its efficient nuclear entry, which could inform new therapeutic strategies."}}

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer\nlarge-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane\nbiomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional\nconfinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we\ndemonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule\nconfinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By\ncontrolling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable\nand reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be\ntuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron\nmicroscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force\nmicroscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained\nwithin the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve\nselective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels\nthrough the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene\noverlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence\nboth from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer.\nOverall, these results

Our\nresults demonstrate that black hole accretion acts as a sensitive probe of the\ntime-dependent cosmic pressure landscape and provides physical insights into\nthe coupling between local strong gravity and global accelerated expansion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u7a0b\u72b6\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e0b\u4fee\u6539\u578b\u9999\u91cc\u5947\u6c14\u4f53\uff08MCG\uff09\u5b87\u5b99\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5bf9\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea2\u79fb\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u03c9(z)\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540cMCG\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bf9\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u968f\u7ea2\u79fb\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6570\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u6570\u548cCPL\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cJBP\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6025\u5267\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0cFSLL-II\u548cBA\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u65f6\u53d8\u538b\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8026\u5408\u3002"}}

However, they can be\ncomputationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems,\nwhich limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models\nreduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations\ncommonly termed beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise,\ncomplicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG\nmodels inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly\nto all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only\nstate-specific quantities available for training.

However, their atomic thinness renders\nthem susceptible to damage during nanoscale fabrication. Focused ion beam\ntechnology, while offering precise defect engineering for tailoring\noptoelectronic properties, often induces collateral damage far beyond the\ntarget region, compromising device performance. This study addresses the\ncritical challenge of preserving the intrinsic optical characteristics of 2D\nTMDCs during FIB patterning. We demonstrate that conventional dielectric\nencapsulation fails to protect 2D TMDCs from gallium ion-induced damage,\nleading to persistent defects and quenched optical responses in patterned\nmicrostructures. In contrast, polymeric encapsulation with PMMA (polymethyl\nmethacrylate) effectively mitigates damage by acting as a sacrificial layer\nthat absorbs ion impact, thereby preserving the optical properties of the\nunderlying TMDC. Furthermore, we leverage XeF2-assisted Ga ion beam direct\npatterning, which significantly reduces collateral damage, minimizes Ga ion\nimplantation, and enables precise anisotropic material removal, yielding\nultra-smooth sidewalls critical for high-quality photonic resonators. This\ncombined approach of PMMA encapsulation and XeF2-assisted FIB patterning offers\na robust, cost-effective, and scalable single-step fabrication route for\nintegrating 2D TMDCs into high-performance photonic devices, thereby\nmaintaining their intrinsic optical functionality essential for advancing\nquantum technologies and compact optical circuits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Frustration is introduced via next-nearest-neighbor interactions,\nwhile single-ion anisotropy is incorporated at each lattice site. Our results\nshow that moderate frustration can drive a phase transition from a\nferrimagnetic state to an anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, the\npresence of a weak easy-plane anisotropy destabilizes the ferrimagnetic order,\nalso leading to the emergence of an antiferromagnetic phase. Interestingly,\nunder strong frustration and anisotropy, the system exhibits signatures of a\nnovel phase with spin density wave (SDW)-like modulation . We explore these\nanomalous phase transitions by employing exact diagonalization (ED) for small\nsystem sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to\ncharacterize ground state properties for larger system sizes. We also\ninvestigate the finite-temperature behavior across various phases using the\nancilla-based time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) approach. The primary\nobjective of this work is to elucidate the phase structure of alternating\nmixed-spin chains under the combined effects of frustration and anisotropy. The\nprimary objective of this work is to elucidate the intricate interplay between\nfrustration and anisotropy in identifying the exotic phases and\nphase-transitions in alternating mixed-spin chains.

Using matrix product states, we investigate these\neffects for the Laughlin-1/2 phase in the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, which\ncan be viewed as the lattice discretization of the bosonic quantum Hall problem\nin the continuum. We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the\ncylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and\nthermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct\ntopological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge\ndensity wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the\ncontinuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a\ntopological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states\nknown from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders. Finally, we carry out a\nsimilar analysis of the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase in the same model.

The method utilizes\ncounterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an\niterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward\nlow-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration\ncorrespond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By\naggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method\nreconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a\nscalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the\ntotal variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann\ndistribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random\ncouplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through\ntransfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass\nHamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that\nclassical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the\nstate-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to\nthree orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS,\ncorresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage.

The\nformulation rests on two invariant elements: the gauge-invariant condensate\nmomentum that governs phase dynamics and the conserved current whose\nhypersurface flux encodes transport for an observer at infinity. Using the\ntimelike Killing field to relate proper and asymptotic quantities, we derive a\nredshifted AC Josephson law in which the asymptotic phase-evolution rate is\nproportional to the difference of redshifted voltage drops, i.e. to $V_i^\\infty\n\\equiv \\alpha_i V_i^{\\rm proper}$; equivalently, it depends on $\\alpha_i\nV_i^{\\rm proper}$ for local control. Under RF drive specified at infinity, the\nShapiro-step loci are invariant (expressed in asymptotic voltages) while\npropagation phases set any apparent lobe translation. For DC transport, a\nshort-junction solution on a static slice yields the proper current-phase\nrelation; mapping to asymptotic observables gives a single-power redshift\nscaling of critical currents, $I_{c,\\infty}\\propto \\alpha I_c^{\\rm proper}$,\nwhereas power scales as $P_\\infty\\propto \\alpha^2 P_{\\rm proper}$. In a\n\"vertical\" dc-SQUID with junctions at different radii, gravity does not shift\nthe DC interference pattern at linear order; it produces a small envelope\ndeformation and an amplitude rescaling.

Here we perform a non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms\nof dressed transmission-line modes for representative resonant coupling\ncircuits, going beyond the weak-coupling treatment. The strong frequency\ndependence of the resulting coupling coefficients implies that the Markov\napproximation commonly employed in cQED analysis is inadequate.

The proposed hybrid approach combines the two approaches by\napplying bit-flip decoding to the readout of the stochastic decoder based on\nthe SLHZ model. We present simulations demonstrating that this approach can\nreveal the latent potential of the SLHZ model, realizing soft-annealing concept\nproposed by Sourlas.", "AI": {"tldr": " paper\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u548c\u7ecf\u5178LDPC\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": " \u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3NP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u89e3\u7801\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": " \u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u548c\u7ecf\u5178LDPC\u89e3\u7801\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": " \u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u7801\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "conclusion": " \u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002"}}

The fluid\nbehaves like a sharply localized droplet propagating rapidly along the\nlightcone, reminiscent of wounded nuclei in the CGC picture. Typical solutions\napproach the hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times despite a Knudsen\nnumber exceeding unity, suggesting that the inverse Reynolds number captures\nhydrodynamization more faithfully since the shear stress vanishes at late\ntimes. This is in stark contrast to Gubser flow, which has both the Knudsen and\ninverse Reynolds number becoming small for intermediate times.

Here, we develop a tripartite entanglement\ndistillation scheme using an eight-photon quantum platform, demonstrating\nentanglement superactivation phenomena which are unique to multipartite\nsystems. We successfully generate a three-photon genuinely entangled state from\ntwo bi-separable states via local operations and classical communication,\ndemonstrating superactivation of genuine multipartite entanglement.\nFurthermore, we extend our scheme to generate a three-photon state capable of\nextracting an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair from two initial states lacking this\ncapability, revealing a previously unobserved entanglement superactivation\nphenomenon. Our methods and findings offer not only practical applications for\nquantum networks, but also lead to a deeper understanding of multipartite\nentanglement structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u53d6\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6ce2\u591a\u6d1b\u592b\u65af\u57fa-\u7f57\u68ee\u5bf9\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u56de\u6536\u548c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u56de\u6536\u548c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f51\u7edc\u6027\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7ea0\u7f20\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u516b\u5149\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u4e09\u6b65\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u5206\u53ef\u5206\u6001\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u51fa\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6ce2\u591a\u6d1b\u592b\u65af\u57fa-\u7f57\u68ee\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea0\u7f20\u8d85\u6fc0\u6d3b\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u6784\u9020\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "1. \u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u771f\u6b63\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\uff1b\n2. \u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6ce2\u591a\u6d1b\u592b\u65af\u57fa-\u7f57\u68ee\u5bf9\u7684\u8d85\u6fc0\u6d3b\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u4e09\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u6784\u9020\u53ca\u63d0\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u6001\u7684\u5de7\u5999\u6784\u9020\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u6fc0\u6d3b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Such\nsimulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical\nto advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and\nmaterials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to\nclean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of\nall previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods,\nand it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale\nquantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we\nimplement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System\nModel H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit\nsystem that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the\nperiodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge\nseparation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple.

On a\npragmatic front, it has gained significant importance as researchers worldwide\nactively engage in the study on quantum networks. However, as typical to any\nquantum resource, network nonlocality is also vulnerable to environmental\nnoise, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. Environmental interactions are\nmodeled in terms of quantum channels. In the present study, we introduce and\ncharacterize network nonlocality breaking channels. Network nonlocality\nbreaking channels model environmental influences which results in the loss of\nresource, i.e., the system loses its nonlocal resource due to such\ninteractions.

Building on a recent result that developed these\nparadoxes into a no-go theorem, namely the Local Friendliness Theorem, we\nintroduce the Causal Friendliness Paradox, a time-ordered analogue of it. In\nthis framework, we replace the usual locality assumption with Axiological Time\nSymmetry (ATS), and show that, when combined with the assumptions of\nAbsoluteness of Observed Events (AOE), No Retrocausality (NRC), and Screening\nvia Pseudo Events (SPE), we obtain a causal inequality.

For\nthis, we need to establish new interfaces that integrate such pulse-level\ncontrol into the lower layers of the software stack, including the need for\nproper representation.\n  Pulse-level quantum programs can be fully described with only three low-level\nabstractions: ports (input/output channels), frames (reference signals), and\nwaveforms (pulse envelopes). We identify four key challenges to represent those\npulse abstractions at: the user-interface level, at the compiler level\n(including the Intermediate Representation (IR)), and at the backend-interface\nlevel (including the appropriate exchange format). For each challenge, we\npropose concrete solutions in the context of MQSS.

With realistic\nsystem parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\\times10^5$ and T center\noptical linewidth $\\Gamma/2\\pi = 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout\nfidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $\\mu$s for both spin readout protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u5149\u8154\u7535\u5b50\u81ea\u65cb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8367\u5149\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u8bfb\u51fa\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u81ea\u65cb\u81ea\u65cb\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u630199%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bfb\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u81ea\u65cb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u7a0b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5149\u8154\u4e0e\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8367\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u81ea\u65cb\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5982\u5149\u8154\u54c1\u8d28\u56e0\u6570\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u5149 linewidth\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u8367\u5149\u8fd8\u662f\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u90fd\u80fd\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u77ed\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5149\u8154\u8d28\u91cf\u56e0\u6570\u4e3a2\u00d710^5\uff0c\u81ea\u65cb\u5149 linewidth \u4e3a100 MHz\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u57288.7 \u03bcs\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc799%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5149\u8154\u5728\u81ea\u65cb\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ec4\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8bfb\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u91cf\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, systematic design\nmethods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are\nlacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial\ntransmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive\nnetwork synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space:\nperiodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent\ncomponents, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in\nspatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric\nprocesses, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in\nsuperconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation\nbetween interacting tones.
