In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators. For the former, the results confirm the accuracy of the new approach by matching prior dimension estimates. For the latter, the analysis demonstrates the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold, highlighting a complex regime that merits further investigation. The presented method offers a practical and efficient tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "A paper presents a more efficient method for estimating inertial manifold dimensions using angles between tangent subspaces spanned by CLVs, reducing computational demands compared to previous approaches.", "motivation": "The problem lies in challenging computational requirements of estimating inertial manifold dimensions, prompting the development of a more efficient alternative method.", "method": "The authors propose utilizing angles between tangent subspaces spanned by CLVs, building on a fast numerical technique for assessing hyperbolicity in chaotic dynamics to reduce computational resources and memory usage by avoiding explicit CLV computation.", "result": "The method is tested on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a correlated chain of Lorenz oscillators.

Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684Ziegler\u6446\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u53ca\u4ece\u89c4\u5219\u8fd0\u52a8\u5411\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65bd\u52a0\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u963b\u5c3c\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f62\u5f0f\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7248\u672c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5468\u671f\u70b9\uff08\u81f3\u5468\u671f3\uff09\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bc6\u96c6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u4f1a\u662f\u5fb7-acre\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bfe\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u4e49Ziegler\u6446\u53ca\u5176\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u6446\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u53ca\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u53ef\u79ef\u6027\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c4\u5219\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u963b\u5c3c\u5f62\u5f0f\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e7f\u4e49Ziegler\u6446\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\uff09\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u963b\u5c3c\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5468\u671f\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u5bc6\u96c6\u5468\u671f\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u5e76\u975e\u6df7\u6c8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5e7f\u4e49Ziegler\u6446\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u6027\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u5916\u90e8\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u963b\u5c3c\uff09\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u5177\u5907Devaney\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u6df7\u6c8c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper investigates how phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions influence synchronization in globally coupled heterogeneous Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators.", "motivation": "Understanding the interplay of phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions is crucial for predicting synchronization behavior in complex oscillator networks.", "method": "The study employs numerical simulations and the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation.

Motivated by recent theoretical work suggesting that self-interacting ultralight axions can be captured by the Sun's gravitational field and thermalize into the ground state, we develop a signal model for the pseudo-magnetic fields generated by axion-proton gradient couplings in such a halo. The analysis focuses on the fifth GNOME Science Run (69 days, 12 stations), employing a cross-correlation pipeline with time-shifted daily modulation templates to search for the global, direction-dependent, monochromatic signal expected from a solar axion halo.

We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We compute the general conformal blocks in this channel for traceless symmetric operators of arbitrary spin in the background of a scalar source, considering both parity-even and parity-odd contributions. Motivated by the availability of data from the conformal bootstrap, we analyze the convergence of this source-detector OPE, taking a tensor product of two decoupled CFTs as an elementary example. Finally, we use positivity of energy correlators to derive novel bounds on OPE coefficients involving the stress-energy tensor in generic CFTs, and demonstrate the application of these bounds in the specific example of the 3d Ising CFT, obtaining new constraints for both parity-even and parity-odd operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $\u03bc$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $\u03bc^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $\u03bc$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The Dirac particle has two distinguished points, the center of charge ${\\bf r}$ and the center of mass ${\\bf q}$. When interacting, the energy expended by the field is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of charge trajectory. The variation of the mechanical energy of the particle is the work done by the external Lorentz force along the center of mass trajectory. If these two works are different the excess of energy must be transformed into radiation returning that energy to the field. The accelerated Dirac particle radiates. We analyze the spin dynamics of the Dirac particle under an external electromagnetic field.

However, identifying a universal topological invariant capable of characterizing higher-order topology remains challenging. Here, we propose a entanglement topological invariant designed to characterize secondorder topological systems. This entanglement topological invariant captures the entanglement of topological corner states under open boundary conditions by employing a bipartite entanglement entropy method. In several representative models, the entanglement topological invariant assumes a nonzero value exclusively in the presence of second-order topology, with its magnitude exactly matching the number of topologically protected corner states. Consequently, the proposed entanglement topological invariant not only provides a clear criterion for detecting higher-order topology, but also offers a quantitative measure for the related corner states. Our study establishes a universal and precise method for characterizing higher-order topological phases, opening avenues for their fundamental understanding and future investigations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8be6\u7ec6\u8868\u5f81\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4e8c\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e24\u5206\u533a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u5176\u503c\u975e\u96f6\u4ec5\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u9636\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8fb9\u89d2\u6001\u6570\u91cf\u5b8c\u5168\u543b\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5224\u522b\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u8fb9\u89d2\u6001\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u695a\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u5224\u522b\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5f00\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e24\u5206\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u975e\u96f6\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6570\u503c\u7b49\u4e8e\u8fb9\u89d2\u6001\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8c\u9636\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5224\u522b\u9ad8\u9636\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u3002"}}

Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive.

Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

While stressed by intense Lorentz forces, the existing HTS/LTS superconductors are prone to a reduction in critical current before reaching their structural mechanical limit. In this work, the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the FNAL 4-layer Bi-2212/Nb$_3$Sn hybrid dipole magnet is reported, aimed at predicting the critical current degradation for both the superconductors during powering at 16 T. All the Rutherford cables in the coils of the hybrid magnet were modeled at the strand level in Ansys APDL with the heterogeneous cable model. Utilizing this detailed geometry, it was possible to evaluate the effects of strain on the critical current degradation for both the Nb$_3$Sn and Bi-2212 superconductors under the intense Lorentz forces. The analysis presented in this paper integrates strain-dependent critical current laws, with parameters derived from experimental data, to simulate the hybrid magnet's performance for all possible current-powering configurations.

However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter \"spike\" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or \"mound\". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Realizing this effect typically requires periodic (lattice) systems with asymmetry of intersite coupling, which is not readily available in many physical platforms. Instead, it is meticulously engineered, e.g., in photonics, which results in complex structures requiring precise fabrication steps. Here, we propose a simpler mechanism: introducing an asymmetric, purely imaginary potential in a topologically trivial system induces momentum-space localization akin to the skin effect. We experimentally demonstrate this localization using exciton polaritons, hybrid light-matter quasi-particles in a simple engineered `round box' trap, pumped by a laser pump offset from the trap center. The effect disappears if the pump is concentric with the trap. The localization persists and becomes stronger at higher densities of polaritons, when a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate is formed and the system becomes nonlinear. Our approach offers a new route to realizing skin effects in continuous, non-periodic systems and exploring the interplay of non-Hermiticity, topology, and nonlinearity in macroscopic quantum states.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We also found that quantifying these motifs with a set of physically interpretable structural and dynamic features efficiently captures the interaction dynamics of the motifs' underlying cells. Using these motif features, we revealed packing strain and defects in large compact aggregates, semi-periodicity in motif ensembles, and phase space classes with unsupervised machine learning. Additionally, we trained neural networks to infer the critical hidden microscopic interaction parameters within each motif from coarse-grained motif features extracted from snapshots of the system. Furthermore, we uncovered emergent features that can predict the movement of cell collectives by hierarchically coarse-graining smaller motifs into larger ones (e.g. motif clusters).

First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "This thesis explores various quantum phenomena and their connections to discrete structures. First, it examines contextuality using graphs and hypergraphs, then delves into causality with directed graphs, and finally looks at measurement incompatibility also using hypergraphs. Each section applies these structures to understand key quantum concepts and tasks.", "motivation": "I wanted to better understand how discrete structures like graphs and hypergraphs can be used to model and analyze quantum phenomena such as contextuality, causality, and measurement incompatibility. Vertex-transitive graphs were important in this research, as they allow for convenient correlations and symmetry arguments.", "method": "The research combined theoretical analysis with mathematical modeling. For contextuality, graph-theoretic approaches were used, inspired by interactions in quantum computing. Directed graphs were employed to represent causal relationships, building on connections to LOCC and SEP. Hypergraphs were utilized to model joint measurability of quantum measurements, inspired by Bell nonlocality studies. I also developed concepts like antinomicity, a device-independent nonclassicality measure based on graph non-colorability.", "result": "The thesis provides new connections between quantum information concepts and discrete mathematics, particularly in graph and hypergraph theory. New results include characterizations of generalized contextuality in terms of hypergraphs, novel characterizations of antinomicity, separation of LOCC and SEP, and a characterization of single-system Bell nonlocality in terms of hypergraph colorings.", "conclusion": "This thesis demonstrates that discrete structures have significant potential for studying quantum phenomena. It contributes new tools, perspectives, and results, while several natural questions remain open for future research."}}

Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \\textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect.

Yet their observational signatures remain effectively indistinguishable from classical stochastic variables. We quantify this tension by showing that quantum inflationary perturbations are continuous variable stabilizer states with vanishing quantum magic, a necessary resource for universal quantum computation as measured by Wigner negativity. Consequently, despite their quantum origins and description, these states can be efficiently simulated using classical algorithms. We further show that the Wigner negativity arising from primordial non-Gaussianity is suppressed not only by the non-linearity parameter $f_{NL}$, but also by the exponential squeezing of the perturbations.

Our results reveal a critical magnetic charge $q_c$.

These solutions are termed ``frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars\" (FSHBSs). Continuously decreasing $\u039b$ disrupts the frozen state. However, we did not find a frozen solution when $q<q_c$. The value of $q_c$ depends both on the cosmological constant $\u039b$ and the self-interaction coupling $\u03b7$. We also found that for high frequency solutions, increasing $\u03b7$ can yield a pure Hayward solution.

Particularly appealing are graphene architectures that incorporate spatially separated radicals and tunable interactions, offering a scalable route toward spin-based quantum architectures. Triangulenes are ideal for this purpose, as their radical count scales with size, although strong hybridization prevents individual spin control. Here, we realize a radical reconfiguration strategy that transforms a single-radical aza-triangulene into a frustrated antiferromagnetic triradical by covalently extending it with armchair anthene moieties of increasing length. Scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveals edge-localized Kondo resonances and a doublet-to-quartet spin excitation, evidencing the emergence of correlated spins. Multi-reference electronic-structure calculations trace the progressive increase in polyradical character with anthene length, driven by the clustering of frontier states within a narrow energy window.

Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures.

Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving $\\sim$10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we re-examined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity.

Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials.

Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity.

We extend the construction to fields with spin 1 and 2, and find that massless spin fields map to spin fields with continuous mass spectra. In this construction, we identify the de Sitter counterparts of the Nambu-Goldstone modes associated with the asymptotic symmetries in Minkowski spacetime.

Nevertheless, the practical implementation of Kerr nonlinearity in waveguides has been constrained by the material's inherently low third-order nonlinear coefficients. Here, we present a significant advancement by demonstrating Pockels effect-induced strong Kerr nonlinearity in a periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate waveguide. Both effective four-wave mixing (FWM) and cascaded effective FWM processes are experimentally observed. The induced FWM process achieves a remarkable maximum output power of -8.5 dBm, spanning a wavelength spectrum of over 116.8 nm. Analysis reveals that the induced effective Kerr nonlinearity exhibits a substantial effective nonlinear refractive index as $2.9\\times 10^{-15} m^{2}W^{-1}$, corresponding to an effective nonlinear refractive index enhancement factor of $1.6\\times 10^{4}$ relative to the intrinsic value. Moreover, a wavelength-converting experiment demonstrates a flat optic-to-optic response over a broadband radiofrequency spectrum, confirming that signal integrity is well preserved after on-chip effective FWM conversion.

Here we show that realistic imperfections substantially enrich the physics of such proximitized double helical liquids. Specifically, we analyze this platform and its fractional counterparts in the presence of pairing and interaction asymmetries between the two channels, as well as random spin-flip terms arising from either magnetic disorder or coexisting charge disorder and external magnetic fields. Using renormalization-group analysis, we determine how Coulomb interactions, pairings, and magnetic disorder collectively influence the transport behavior and topological properties of the double helical liquid. As the system transitions from class DIII to class BDI, an additional topological phase supporting a single Majorana zero mode per corner emerges. We further show how additional pairing or Coulomb asymmetry influences the stability of various topological phases and uncovers a revival of Majorana zero modes and cascades of transitions through topological phases characterized by a $\\mathbb {Z}$ invariant, which are accessible through controlling the electrical screening effect. In contrast to conventional understanding, disorder is not merely detrimental, as it in general allows for a tuning knob that qualitatively reshapes the topological superconductivity in imperfect helical liquids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb\u6db2\u4f53\u8d28\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u87ba\u65cb\u72b6\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u78c1\u6027\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 renormalization-group \u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u78c1\u6027\u65e0\u5e8f\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u8f6c\u53d8\u548c Majorana \u96f6\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u7eaf\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u62d3\u6251\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u87ba\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7535\u6563\u5c04\u6548\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u5404\u79cd\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u7eaf\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8c03\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u3002"}}

After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x < 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\\mathrm{C} \\approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \\le x \\le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\\mathrm{C} \\approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx$ 120 K; finally for $x > 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\\mathrm{N} \\approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35.

Our analysis is performed within the context of the ``dark dimension'' scenario, a theoretical consequence of the Swampland Program that predicts a single micron-scale extra dimension to explain the observed value of dark energy. We demonstrate that within this scenario, the mass loss of a primordial rotating black hole sensitive to the fifth dimension is significantly slower than that of its four-dimensional counterpart. Consequently, primordial black holes with an initial mass of $M\\gtrsim 10^{10}$g can survive to the present day and potentially constitute the dominant form of dark matter.

In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u4e0e\u95ed\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u7531\u901f\u5ea6\u578b\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5747\u503c\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u5bfc\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u4e58\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u522b\u6c42\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u6c42\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u5206\u62c6\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u754c\u53d8\u677e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u91cf\u5b50\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u4e58\u5c55\u5f00\u6c42\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u7531\u901f\u5ea6\u578b\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5747\u503c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u5bfc\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u9636\u4e58\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5143\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u8f83\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u677e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u5206\u62c6\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u95ed\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6da8\u843d\u7387\u4e0a\u754c\u66f4\u4e3a\u7d27\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u754c\u66f4\u677e\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6697\u793a\u5f00\u653e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u8017\u6563\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

We derive an analytic expression of ensemble sensitivity for inhomogeneous spin sensors and introduce sensitivity thresholds that reveal the optimal spin subset. Applied to both pulsed and continuous-wave magnetometry, the optimal subsets deliver up to a tenfold improvement over conventional schemes relying on nominally uniform regions of the ensembles.

Exploration of anomalous responses, particularly those analogous to superconductivity, has become an urgent theoretical issue. In this study, we show that the IVC order gives rise to anomalous valley-current generation driven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The anomalous valley current exhibits a characteristic power-law dependence for low-frequency SAWs.

In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \\sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x>0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $\u03c7({\\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the N\u00e9el $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping.

All eight qubits are successfully tuned and characterized as four double dot pairs, exhibiting Ramsey dephasing times $T_2^*$ up to 41(2) $\u03bc$s and Hahn-echo coherence times $T_2^{\\mathrm{Hahn}}$ up to 1.31(4) ms. Readout of the central four qubits is achieved via a cascaded charge-sensing protocol, enabling simultaneous high-fidelity measurements of the entire multi-qubit array.

For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V .

While the linear regime has been studied in a number of settings, little is known about the nonlinear evolution of this ergoregion instability. Here, we investigate this by numerically evolving the unstable growth of a massless vector field in a rapidly spinning boson star in full general relativity. We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation. During the nonlinear growth phase, small scale features develop in the unstable mode and emitted radiation as nonlinear gravitational interactions mediate a direct turbulent cascade.

In this study, we introduce a multi-head attention network (MuHAN) to accelerate the design of ultrahigh Q-factor optical chiral resonators in bilayer metasurfaces.

The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data.

Finally, we illuminate the path forward by proposing essential future directions that underscore the integration of high-dimensional multipartite quantum communications with sensing, computing, and intelligence for multiple users en route to realizing a fully operational Quantum Internet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u201c\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5929\u9645\u7ebf\u201c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0b\u7684\u9065\u8fdc\u8282\u70b9\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u7f72\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u536b\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7ec8\u7aef\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5730\u9762\u969c\u788d\u7269\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6700\u540e\u89c4\u5212\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7ef4\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u975e\u5730\u9762\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u536b\u661f\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5178\u578b\u975e\u5730\u9762\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u536b\u661f\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7ec8\u7aef\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5929\u9645\u7ebf\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u536b\u661f\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Non-invasive and quantitative nanoscale magnetic imaging of the two-dimensional stray field profile at the sample surface is essential for understanding the fundamental properties of the spin-structure and being able to tailor them to achieve new functionalities. However, the deterministic detection of spin textures and their quantitative characterization on the nanoscale remain challenging. Here, we use nitrogen-vacancy scanning probe microscopy (NV-SPM) under ambient conditions to perform the first quantitative vector-field magnetometry measurements in the multilayered SAF [(Co/Pt)$_5$/Co/Ru]$_3$/(Co/Pt)$_6$. We investigate nanoscale static and dynamic properties of antiferromagnetic domains with boundaries hosting ``one-dimensional'' ferromagnetic stripes with ~ 100 nm of width and periodic modulation of the magnetization. By employing NV-SPM measurements in different imaging modes and involving NV-probes with various crystallographic orientations, we demonstrated distinct fingerprints emerging from GHz-range spin noise and constant stray fields on the order of several mT. This provides quantitative insights into the structure of domains and domain walls, as well as, into magnetic noise associated with thermal spin-waves.

We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators.

These polytopes appear as scaled Minkowski sums of the Newton polytopes associated with the Symanzik graph polynomials. For one-loop graphs and multiloop sunset graphs, we identify the Fano and reflexive cases by computing the number of interior points from the associated bivariate Ehrhart polynomials. More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals.", "AI": {"tldr": "We classified Fano and reflexive polytopes arising from quasi-finite Feynman integrals, analyzing their properties and connections to Calabi-Yau varieties.", "motivation": "Understanding the geometric structures of Feynman integrals is crucial for advancing quantum field theory.", "method": "We used bivariate Ehrhart polynomials and Symanzik polynomials to identify Fano and reflexive polytopes in one-loop and multiloop graphs.", "result": "Only a few low-dimensional reflexive and Fano polytopes exist, and reflexive polytopes are linked to Calabi-Yau varieties.", "conclusion": "Quasi-finite Feynman integrals are inherently connected to Calabi-Yau period integrals via their polytope structures."}}

The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision.

Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease.

Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}} d_{\\mathrm{out}} k/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels.

Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation.

Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In all of these cases, the defects have a non-trivial monodromy for the maximal abelian subgroup for the SO($9-p$) R-symmetry. Such solutions are obtained by considering branes wrapping spindle configurations, changing the parameters (which alters the coordinate domain), and imposing suitable boundary conditions. We provide a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of the effective theory on the defect. We find the resulting quantity to be proportional to the free energy of the ambient theory. Similar analysis is performed for the D5-brane wrapping a spindle, but we find that changing the coordinate domain does not lead to a defect solution, but rather a circle compactification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u5728p+1\u7ef4SU(N)\u6781\u5927\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u6768\u7c73\u5c14\u65af\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f3a\u9677\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u5177\u6709SO(9-p) R-\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\u7684\u975e\u96f6\u5355\u6027\u5b50\u7fa4\u3002\u89e3\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u7ed5\u7ebf\u5f62\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5f26\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u8c03\u6574\u5750\u6807\u57df\uff09\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0aEffective\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6240\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u91cf\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u3002\u5bf9D5\u819c\u7ed5\u7ebf\u5f62\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u5750\u6807\u57df\u540e\u5e76\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7f3a\u9677\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u73af\u5f62\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u89e3\u4e0e\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u7406\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u65bd\u52a0\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7269\u7406\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u89e3\u4f7f\u5f97\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0a\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\uff0c\u4e14D5\u819c\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u5750\u6807\u57df\u540e\u672a\u5f62\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u73af\u5f62\u7d27\u81f4\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8d85\u91cd\u529b\u89e3\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u8d85\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f3a\u9677\u7ea0\u7f20\u71b5\u4e0e\u5468\u56f4\u7406\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7Kantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u5fb7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6709\u5173\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cDarboux\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\u548cKantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Darboux\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u79d8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5185\u5916\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0 master\u51fd\u6570\u7684Canonical\u8f6c\u6362\u4e0eDarboux\u53d8\u6362\u6070\u597d\u76f8\u543b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7Kantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u7a7a\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Darboux\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Canonical\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u5e0c\u5c14\u5fb7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u5916\u7684\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u660e\u786e\u5730\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

We present evidence that our lower bounds on the multipoles are nearly saturated by the ${\\cal N} = 4$ SYM theory. In the planar limit, we further use dispersive functionals to obtain tight two-sided bounds on both the first three non-trivial multipoles and on the angular dependence of the energy-energy correlator. As the coupling is varied from weak to strong, the energy-energy correlator exhibits a transition from single-trace to double-trace operator dominance in the collinear limit, which we characterize quantitatively.

Its all-photonic version - mediated by the interference of photon pairs generated by separate quantum systems-finds disparate applications in quantum networks. So far, all-photonic entanglement swapping between remote systems has been implemented only using sources that operate probabilistically. However, the scaling up of quantum networks requires deterministic quantum emitters that do not suffer from a trade-off between degree of entanglement and photonpair generation rate. Here, we demonstrate all-photonic entanglement swapping using photon-pairs generated by two separate GaAs quantum dots. The emitters are deterministically embedded in hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric devices that make the entangled-photons from two dissimilar quantum dots nearly identical. Entanglement swapping is demonstrated with a fidelity as high as 0.71(2), more than 10 standard deviations above the classical limit. The experimental data are quantitatively explained by a theoretical model that also suggests how to boost the protocol performances.

We propose an integrated photonic scheme that creates high-fidelity ECS from a two-mode squeezed vacuum via photon subtraction in a symmetric waveguide trimer. The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so.

Here, we investigate the effect of the misalignment between the BLG lattice and the cavity geometry, introduced by rotating the boundary relative to the lattice, which can drive the system towards chaos. Based on a tight-binding model, eigenenergy level statistics reveals that rotation leads to level repulsion following Wigner-Dyson statistics, while corresponding eigenstate analysis indicates a transition from near-integrability to spatially uncorrelated random waves. Analysis of the semiclassical ray-dynamics with the trigonal-warped dispersion unveils an ergodic phase space structure, providing a quantum-classical correspondence of the onset of chaos. These findings establish an avenue to quantum chaotic phenomena in BLG cavities with potential applications in quantum device engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86bilayer graphen (BLG) \u8154\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7531\u8fb9\u754c\u9762\u65cb\u8f6c\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u670d\u4eceWigner-Dyson\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f34\u968fFloquet\u72b6\u6001\u4ece\u8fd1\u79ef casing\u5411\u65e0\u5173\u8054\u968f\u673a\u6ce2\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u5bf9\u5e94\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u6709\u5e8f\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u73af\u9762\u94fa\u5c55\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u548cFloquet\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u534a\u7ecf\u5178\u73af\u8def\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fb9\u754c\u4f7fBLG\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u7b26\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7BLG\u8154\u5ba4\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u754c\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u6df7\u6c8c\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u6240\u542f\u53d1\u3002"}}

We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices.

We assume invariance under time and spatial translations, so that the Green's function $G$ depends on $\u03c9$ and $\\vec k$. We discuss that in Fourier space microcausality is equivalent to the analyticity of $G$ when $\\Im (\u03c9,\\vec k)$ lies in the forward light-cone, supplemented by bounds on the growth of $G$ as one approaches the boundaries of this domain. Microcausality also implies that the imaginary part of $G$ (its spectral density) cannot have compact support for real $(\u03c9,\\vec k)$. Using analyticity, we write multi-variable dispersion relations and show that the spectral density must satisfy a family of integral constraints. Analogous constraints can be applied to the fluctuations of the system, via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A stable physical system, which can only absorb energy from external sources, satisfies $\u03c9\\cdot \\Im G(\u03c9,\\vec k) \\ge 0$ for real $(\u03c9,\\vec k)$. We show that this positivity property can be extended to the complex domain: $\\Im [\u03c9\\, G(\u03c9,\\vec k)] >0$ in the domain of analyticity guaranteed by microcausality. Functions with this property belong to the Herglotz-Nevanlinna class. This allows to prove the analyticity of the permittivities $\u03b5(\u03c9,k)$ and $\u03bc^{-1}(\u03c9,k)$ that appear in Maxwell equations in a medium.

Such systems with $n \\geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, we show that the de Sitter analogs of these various interpretations do not necessarily coincide but rather lead to distinct, observer-dependent light-ray operators.

Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u70b9\u6e90\u7684\u5c0f\u5206\u79bb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b,\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650,\u4e3a\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c,\u4e0d\u9002\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u5b54\u5f84\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba,\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u7d27\u5bc6\u72ed\u7f1d\u5f62\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u65b9\u5411\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e14\u76f8\u7b49\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u91c7\u6837\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b,\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u548c\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e- Rao\u754c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762,\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u4f4d-\u5f84\u5411\u6781\u5316\u57fa\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2,\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d\u524d\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u8f6c\u5e72\u6d89\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u9971\u548c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u6210\u50cf\u5728\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u5149\u5b66 Beacons\u7b49\u7d27\u5bc6\u5149\u5b50\u6e90\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c,\u4e0d\u9002\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u5b54\u5f84\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba,\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898,\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5411\u91cf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u4e24\u6b65:\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u6a21\u578b,\u8003\u8651\u4e24\u79cd\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u65b9\u5411\u72b6\u6001,\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u91c7\u6837\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u53ca\u514b\u62c9\u7f8e- Rao\u754c\u3002\u5176\u6b21,\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u95ee\u9898,\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5,\u5373\u65b9\u4f4d-\u5f84\u5411\u6781\u5316\u57fa\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e,\u5411\u91cf\u6027\u6548\u5e94 significantly\u5f71\u54cd\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf,\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u65b9\u5411\u81ea\u7531\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u4f4d-\u5f84\u5411\u6781\u5316\u57fa\u6ee4\u6ce2,\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u9971\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u5b54\u5f84\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba,\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86 doubledipole\u5076\u6781\u5b50\u5206\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u9002\u5f53\u5904\u7406\u5411\u91cf\u4f4d\u76f8\u4fe1\u606f,\u80fd\u591f\u7a81\u7834\u6807\u91cf\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u9650\u5236,\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u8d39\u820d\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u9971\u548c,\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6570\u503c\u5b54\u5f84\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4e0b\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Using the adiabatic regularization method, we systematically remove ultraviolet divergences and obtain explicit finite expressions for the components of the induced energy--momentum tensor. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the renormalized tensor behaves smoothly with respect to the parameters of the system and exhibits physically consistent limits in both the strong-field and infrared regimes. The induced energy density grows with the field strength and follows a quadratic behavior, which is consistent with the Schwinger mechanism in three dimension. In the opposite infrared regime, the tensor components display inverse-mass dependence, revealing infrared divergences typical of nearly massless scalar fields in curved space. Finally, we evaluate the trace of the renormalized tensor and show that for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field the trace anomaly vanishes, confirming the absence of a genuine Weyl anomaly in odd-dimensional spacetimes. These results provide a consistent and covariant description of quantum vacuum polarization and backreaction effects in three-dimensional de Sitter geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5e26\u6709\u5747\u5300\u7535\u573a\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u914d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53bb\u9664\u4e86\u7d2b\u5916\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u91cf\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f20\u91cf\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f3a\u573a\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u968f\u573a\u5f3a\u589e\u957f\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u4e09\u7ef4\u8212\u66fc\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7ea2\u5916\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u53cd\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u8fd1\u96f6\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5f20\u91cf\u8ff9\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5171\u5f62\u8026\u5408\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5947\u6570\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u97e6\u4f9d anomaly\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u5b50\u865a\u6781\u5316\u548c\u56de\u54cd\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u534f\u53d8\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u7535\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u6548\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u914d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u53bb\u9664\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u9650\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u968f\u573a\u5f3a\u589e\u957f\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u8212\u66fc\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u7ea2\u5916\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u91cf\u663e\u793a\u53cd\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7b26\u5408\u8fd1\u96f6\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5f20\u91cf\u8ff9\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5171\u5f62\u8026\u5408\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u8ff9\u5f02\u5e38\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5947\u6570\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u97e6\u4f9d anomaly\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u53cd\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5e26\u7535\u573a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u80fd\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u534f\u53d8\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u865a\u6781\u5316\u548c\u56de\u54cd\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8109\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408PTA\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u572815\u5e74\u5185\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u8109\u661f\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u4e9a\u79d2\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76 aim \u4e8c\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2/radiowave\u6e90\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u52a0\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u8ddd\u79bb\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5229\u7528PTA\u4e0eGW\u6e90\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u5185\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u90e8\u5206\u8109\u661f\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u8109\u661f\u5728$\textsim 1.4$ kpc\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e9a\u79d2\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8ePTA\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u90e8\u5206\u8109\u661f\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We present a covariant formulation of the TMG theory by introducing an unphysical dilaton field through the conformal transformation. We conduct the BRST quantization of the covariant TMG theory, which reduces to the conventional TMG in the unitary gauge. We demonstrate that this covariant TMG theory conserves the physical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the massless limit, under which the physical massive graviton becomes an unphysical massless graviton and its physical DoF is converted to the massless dilaton. With these, we newly establish a topological gravity equivalence theorem (TGRET), which connects each scattering amplitude of physical gravitons to the corresponding dilaton scattering amplitude in the high energy limit. The TGRET provides a general mechanism to guarantee all the large energy cancellations in any massive graviton scattering amplitudes. Applying the TGRET and using the generalized gravitational power counting rule, we prove that the $N$-point massive graviton amplitudes ($N\\geqslant 4$) have striking energy cancellations by powers proportional to $\\frac{5}{2}N$ ($\\frac{7}{2}N$) in the Landau (unitary) gauge. This explains the large energy cancellations of $E^{11}\\to E^1$ (Landau gauge) and $E^{12}\\to E^1$ (unitary gauge) for the four graviton amplitudes. We compute the four-point graviton (dilaton) amplitudes and explicitly demonstrate the TGRET and these large energy cancellations.

We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value.

The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ans\u00e4tze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution.

Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.\n  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states.

Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights.

First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\\sqrt{d})$. Although incoherent access is generally weaker than coherent access, our incoherent algorithm matches this complexity by leveraging additional shared randomness between devices, highlighting the power of shared randomness in distributed quantum learning.

First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $\u03c4_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits.

As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\uff08CV\uff09\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b7\u5374\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5229\u7528\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u8d44\u6e90\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u9ad8\u65af\u51b7\u5374\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b7\u5374\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u800c\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\u5e73\u53f0\u6b63\u5728\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u51b7\u5374\u9650\u5236\u662f\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u51b7\u5374CV\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e00\u754c\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528p-\u6fc0\u53d1\u4ea4\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u8d44\u6e90\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u51b7\u5374\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230p\u500d\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u9ad8\u65af\u51b7\u5374\u9650\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u8d77\u5230\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u4e86CV\u70ed\u6d74\u7b97\u6cd5\u51b7\u5374\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b7\u5374\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Noto"], "title": "Quantum Approaches to Urban Logistics: From Core QAOA to Clustered Scalability", "comment": null, "summary": "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial optimization, widely applied in logistics and transportation. As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes. This study investigates the potential of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical method, to solve TSP under realistic constraints. We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios.

We then apply these algorithms to estimate DEMs from Google's 72- and 105-qubit chips. Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \\emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728 syndrome-based DEM\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u77e5DEM\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u9650\u5236\u3002\u7136\u540e\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1Google 72-\u548c105-\u4f4d\u82af\u7247\u7684DEM\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0fDEM\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c syndromes\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684DEM\u5728\u672a\u89c1syndrome\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u7684DEM\uff0c\u4f46\u540e\u8005\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5148\u9a8c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1DEM\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5168\u5c40\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u8868\u5f81\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u53d1\u73b0105\u4f4d\u82af\u7247\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u6743\u91cdPauli\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801 syndromes\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u76f8\u90bb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u7ffb\u8f6c\u53ca\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\uff08DEM\uff09\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u95e8\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u3002\u5f00\u53d1syndrome-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u53bb\u9664\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684DEM\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u77e5DEM\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGoogle\u768472-\u548c105-\u4f4d\u82af\u7247\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0fDEM\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83 syndromes\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684DEM\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u7684DEM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790DEM\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0csyndrome-based DEM\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u7684DEM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u6743\u91cdPauli\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801 syndromes\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u76f8\u90bb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u7ffb\u8f6c\u53ca\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9891\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86syndrome-based DEM\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0csyndrome-based DEM\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u7684DEM\u66f4\u4f18\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this work we present two improvements to the original prescription.

Our starting point is the complexity class $\\textsf{NBQP}$ (\"noisy BQP\"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure.
