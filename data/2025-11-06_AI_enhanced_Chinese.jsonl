In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat\ncapacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states\ncontinuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the\nIsing model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy\nassociated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically\nthe values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered\nsystems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally\nmeasured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$,\n$FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from\nthe classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be\nconnected.

Phase-sensitive THz detection is currently achieved using nonlinear\ncrystals or external interferometers and photomixers. However, the former\napproach requires femtosecond pulsed radiation, and all approaches suffer from\na large footprint and sensitive alignment. Here, we demonstrate a\ngraphene-enabled, on-chip, integrated THz detector-interferometer with optical\ncavity and antenna, exhibiting high sensitivity to the phase of incident THz\nlight. We exploit this by determining the thickness of thin films placed in\nfront of the detector-interferometer, obtaining a strongly sub-wavelength\nthickness accuracy of $\\sim$5 $\\mu$m, while we predict that an accuracy of 10\nnm is within reach. This is relevant for a range of industrial application\ndomains, including automotive, construction, and health.

The presence of the halo modifies the\nspacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing\nthe particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the\nconditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic\ntrajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By\nanalyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure,\nwe identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon\nregion.

To this\nend, Evangelista's Wick&d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native\nAGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for\nthe RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a\nspin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version\ndeveloped by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting\nimplementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when\nexecuted on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is\nshown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active\nspace spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely\ndue to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than\nthree-body enter the formalism.

Beyond its immediate computational utility, the\nframework offers a unified perspective on the emergence of nonperturbative\neffects (such as Schwinger pair creation) in relation to perturbative heat\nkernel data, and provides a basis for future extensions to curved spacetimes\nand non-Abelian gauge theories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u70ed\u6838\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u70ed\u6838\u5c55\u5f00\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728 Yukawa \u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u731c\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u4ecd\u7136\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u7535\u78c1\u5f20\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u81ea\u65cborial \u8026\u5408\u6784\u9020\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u6c42\u548c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u5e94\uff08\u5982 Schwinger \u5bf9\u7acb\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\uff09\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u70ed\u6838\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u5f2f\u66f2\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u70ed\u6838\u6280\u672f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u70ed\u6838\u5c55\u5f00\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5df2\u77e5\u7684 Yukawa \u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6807\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u573a\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cd\u7ec4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u56fa\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u7406\u8bba\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

As an emergent material candidate\nfor such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based\nspin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit\ntorque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic\neffect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at\ninterfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse\nspin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable\nvia an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the\ntight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF)\nformalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT\nswitching of an out-of-plane free magnet.

Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism,\nwe demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in\ngraphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism\nenables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way\nfor applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal\ntransport.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

We find that the\nnon-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric\ndensity cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry\ncan be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity parameter, $\\delta$. Next, we\nanalyze the dynamics of this system in the presence of a static external force\nand demonstrate that non-Hermiticity leads to asymmetric two-particle Bloch\noscillations. Interestingly, when $F=0$ ($F \\ne 0$), strong interactions leads\nto the formation of an inner density-cone (density-hourglass) structure; this\ninner structure also becomes asymmetric in the presence of non-Hermiticity.

It also raises concerns over the\nscalability of these approaches, as dimensionality reduction methods are slow\nto adapt to large datasets. In this article, we analyze how data reduction\nmethods affect different QML models. We conduct this experiment over several\ngenerated datasets, quantum machine algorithms, quantum data encoding methods,\nand data reduction methods. All these models were evaluated on the performance\nmetrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Solving an optimization problem $P$ via QA\ninvolves a hardware-aware circuit compilation which requires representing $P$\nas a graph $G_P$ and embedding it into the hardware connectivity graph $G_Q$\nthat defines how qubits connect to each other in a QA-based quantum processing\nunit (QPU).\n  Minor Embedding (ME) is a possible operational form of this hardware-aware\ncompilation. ME heuristically builds a map that associates each node of $G_P$\n-- the logical variables of $P$ -- to a chain of adjacent nodes in $G_Q$ by\nmeans of one of its minors, so that the arcs of $G_P$ are preserved as physical\nconnections among qubits in $G_Q$.\n  The static topology of hardwired qubits can clearly lead to inefficient\ncompilations because $G_Q$ cannot be a clique, currently. We propose a\nmethodology and a set of criteria to evaluate how the hardware topology $G_Q$\ncan negatively affect the embedded problem, thus making the quantum\noptimization more sensible to noise.\n  We evaluate the result of ME across two QPU topologies: Zephyr graphs (used\nin current D-Wave systems) and Havel-Hakimi graphs, which allow controlled\nvariation of the average node degree. This enables us to study how the ratio\n`number of nodes/number of incident arcs per node' affects ME success rates to\nmap $G_P$ into a minor of $G_Q$.\n  Our findings, obtained through ME executed on classical, i.e. non-quantum,\narchitectures, suggest that Havel-Hakimi-based topologies, on average, require\nshorter qubit chains in the minor of $G_P$, exhibiting smoother scaling of the\nlargest embeddable $G_P$ as the QPU size increases.

The method can be readily integrated into standard\ncomputational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time\ndomain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the\ncompleteness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin\nnoise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens\nfunction through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction\nenables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi\nmode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the\nsingle excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level\nsystem is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying\nthat radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework\nthus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population\nand single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers.

In this model, quantum algorithms have been\nshown to offer an unconditional exponential advantage in space. However,\nexperimentally implementing such streaming algorithms requires qubits that\nremain coherent while interacting with an external data stream. In this work,\nwe realize such a data-streaming model using Quantinuum Helios trapped-ion\nquantum computer with long-lived qubits that communicate with an external\nserver. We implement a quantum pair sketch, which is the primitive underlying\nmany quantum streaming algorithms, and use it to solve Hidden Matching, a\nproblem known to exhibit a theoretical exponential quantum advantage in space.\nFurthermore, we compile the quantum streaming algorithm to fault-tolerant\nquantum architectures based on surface and bivariate bicycle codes and show\nthat the quantum space advantage persists even with the overheads of\nfault-tolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper presents a quantum algorithm for classical data-streaming problems that achieves an exponential space advantage over classical algorithms. thanks to the use of trapdmouth qubits and advanced quantum coding, the algorithm is feasible to implement on current quantum hardware despite challenges in maintaining quantum coherence in real-time data processing.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this work is to leverage quantum computing to solve classical streaming problems more efficiently. While quantum computers have shown potential for exponential speedups in certain tasks, practical implementation has often been hindered by technical challenges. This paper aims to address those challenges by developing a quantum algorithm specifically for streaming problems and demonstrating its feasibility on current quantum hardware.", "method": "The method used in this paper involves the use of a trapped-ion quantum computer, such as the Quantinuum Helios, which has long-lived qubits. The authors implement a quantum pair sketch, a primitive underlying many quantum streaming algorithms, to solve the Hidden Matching problem. They also compile the algorithm for fault-tolerant quantum architectures based on surface and lattice codes to account for potential errors and overheads.", "result": "The results of this paper show that the quantum pair sketch algorithm achieves an exponential advantage in space over classical algorithms for the Hidden Matching problem. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that this quantum space advantage persists even when accounting for the overheads of fault-tolerant quantum architectures. The successful implementation on a trapped-ion quantum computer suggests that quantum streaming algorithms may become practical with current technology.", "conclusion": "In conclusion, this paper provides a significant step toward realizing practical quantum streaming algorithms by demonstrating an exponential quantum advantage in space and showing that the overheads of fault-tolerant quantum architectures are manageable. The results open up new possibilities for leveraging quantum computing to solve real-world streaming problems efficiently."}}
