To address this, we recently developed the Latent Ewald\nSummation (LES) method, which infers electrostatic interactions, polarization,\nand Born effective charges (BECs), just by learning from energy and force\ntraining data. Here, we present LES as a standalone library, compatible with\nany short-range MLIP, and demonstrate its integration with methods such as\nMACE, NequIP, CACE, and CHGNet. We benchmark LES-enhanced models on distinct\nsystems, including bulk water, polar dipeptides, and gold dimer adsorption on\ndefective substrates, and show that LES not only captures correct\nelectrostatics but also improves accuracy. Additionally, we scale LES to large\nand chemically diverse data by training MACELES-OFF on the SPICE set containing\nmolecules and clusters, making a universal MLIP with electrostatics for organic\nsystems including biomolecules. MACELES-OFF is more accurate than its\nshort-range counterpart (MACE-OFF) trained on the same dataset, predicts\ndipoles and BECs reliably, and has better descriptions of bulk liquids.

We\nsimulate both steps of the pump-probe experiment conducted on Na$^+$\n[Albrechtsen et al., Nature 623, 319 (2023)], where the alkali atom residing at\nthe droplet surface is ionized by the pump pulse and its solvation is probed by\nionizing a central xenon atom and detecting the expulsed Na$^+$He$_n$ ions. Our\nresults confirm the Poissonian model for the binding of the first five He atoms\nfor the lighter Na$^+$ and K$^+$ alkalis, with a rate in good agreement with\nthe more recent experimental results on Na$^+$ [Albrechtsen et al., J. Chem.\nPhys. 162, 174309 (2025)]. For the probe step we show that the ion takes\nseveral picoseconds to get out of the droplet. During this rather long time,\nthe solvation structure around it is very hot and far from equilibrium, and it\ncan gain or lose more He atoms. Surprisingly, analysing the Na$^+$ solvation\nstructure energy reveals that it is not stable by itself during the first few\npicoseconds of the solvation process.

In particular, the results provide evidence that the\nobserved systematic increase of intermittency, as the shell spacing is\ndecreased, is associated with strong phase alignment among consecutive triadic\nphases, facilitating the energy cascade. It is shown that while the overall\nlevel of synchronization can be quantified using a Kuramoto order parameter for\nthe global phase coherence in the inertial range, a local, weighted Kuramoto\nparameter can be used for the detection of burst-like events propagating across\nshells in the inertial range. This novel analysis reveals how partially\nphase-locked states are associated with the passage of extreme events of energy\nflux. Applying this method to helical shell models, reveals that for a\nparticular class of helical interactions, a reduction in phase coherence\ncorrelates with suppression of intermittency. When inverse cascade scenarios\nare considered using two different shell models including a non local helical\nshell model, and a local standard shell model with a modified conservation law,\nit was shown that a particular phase organization is needed in order to sustain\nthe inverse energy cascade. It was also observed that the PDFs of the triadic\nphases were peaked in accordance with the basic considerations of the form of\nthe flux, which suggests that a triadic phase of \\pi/2 and -\\pi/2 maximizes the\nforward and the inverse energy cascades respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4e3b\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u57df Kuramoto\u53c2\u6570\u68c0\u6d4b bursts\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d helical\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d coherence \u7b2c\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7684\u6291\u5236\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9006 cascade \u7684\u7ef4\u6301\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e09\u89d2\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684PDF\u7b26\u5408\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8003\u8651\u3002", "motivation": "\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63cf\u8ff0\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u5b50\u76f8\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u5b50\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e94\u7528Kuramoto order parameter\u8bc4\u4f30\u6574\u4f53\u76f8\u4f4d\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u57dfKuramoto parameter\u63a2\u6d4bburst\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u4f4d\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c helical\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u9006 cascade\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4e09\u89d2\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684PDF\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "-shell \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u534f\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u91cf\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u76f8\u4f4d\u9501\u5b9a\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6781\u7aef\u80fd\u91cf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u58f3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u91cf\u6d41\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7ef4\u6301\u9700\u8981\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002"}}

The matter sector is modeled using the Modified Chaplygin\nGas (MCG) with the equation of state $p=A\\rho-\\frac{B}{\\rho^{\\alpha}}$,\nallowing the model to interpolate between early-time matter behavior and\nlate-time cosmic acceleration. By deriving an analytical expression for the\nHubble parameter $H(z)$, we perform a parameter estimation using Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in conjunction with the latest cosmological\nobservations: $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, $15$ BAO data points, DESI\nDR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation.

When\ncombined with radiotherapy (RT), forming thermoradiotherapy (TRT), a\nsynergistic effect is observed across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies.\nThe greatest radiosensitization occurs when HT and RT are applied\nsimultaneously. This work aims to explore physical mechanisms -- beyond DNA\nrepair inhibition -- that contribute to this synergy.\n  Approach: We developed a biophysical model for the thermal enhancement ratio\n(TER), incorporating temperature-dependent variations in the number of\nvulnerable DNA sites, the DNA-ion/particle interaction cross-section, and other\nphysicochemical parameters. These include ion production rate, diffusion\nprocesses, and medium density. The model includes misrepair effects\nphenomenologically, which make it consistent with other studies.\n  Main results: The model reproduces TER values observed under simultaneous HT\nand RT in isolated plasmids with variable temperature. Our results indicate\nthat, in addition to misrepair, other physical factors contribute to\nradiosensitization under concurrent treatment. Among these, the\ntemperature-dependent amplification of DNA-ion/particle interaction\ncross-section -- driven by enhanced DNA thermal fluctuations structure --\nemerges as the second most influential factor.\n  Significance: These findings suggest that thermal radiosensitization arises\nnot only from impaired repair, but also from increased physical vulnerability\nof the DNA.

One of the\nmain ideas for studying the coiling of an elastic plant stem is to consider the\ngrowth of the plant stem in terms of evolution over time. However, as this\ndevelopment takes place over a long time scale, the static study alone has not\nbeen studied independently. Our static approach requires us to take into\naccount elasticity, turgor pressure and gravity forces in a first analysis. The\naim of this article is to present a simplified model demonstrating why plant\nstems climb mainly on their circular helix-shaped stakes, with the diameter of\nthe stake playing an important role in plant stem ascent, as does the fineness\nof the stem. To perform this calculation, for a given mass density, we consider\nthe variational principle of minimum energy. For thin plant stems, we can see,\nin first approximation, that the effect of gravity and turgor pressure can be\nneglected with respect to the energy of elasticity, and that the bulk of the\ncalculation concerns elasticity terms.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper presents a simplified model showing plant stems climb on vertical circular helices, influenced by stake diameter and stem fineness. They used variational principles, neglecting gravity and turgor for thin stems, focusing on elasticity.", "motivation": "Understanding plant growth mechanics and form is crucial for biology, botany, and agriculture. The paper tackles a complex problem with elegant simplifications, seeking to explain plant climbing mechanics.", "method": "The authors used a variational principle approach, considering minimal energy for a plant stem under the influence of gravity, turgor pressure, and elasticity. They analyzed thin stems, neglecting gravity and turgor, focusing on energy from elasticity.", "result": "The analysis revealed that plant stems ascend primarily on helical stands with vertical orientation, emphasizing the role of stake diameter and stem thickness. The static equilibrium explains stable climbing helices and unstable spirals when these factors are imbalanced.", "conclusion": "Studying plant stem mechanics through static equilibrium can explain their climbing behavior. The model provides a foundation, incorporating growth over time and mechanical forces for dynamic analysis in future studies. For the vertical climb, the model successfully predicts helical paths influenced by critical factors like diameter and thickness."}}

In this\napproach, we study the influence of thermal radiation on atomic systems. Along\nthe way, we found well-known effects, including thermal Stark and Zeeman\nshifts, as well as thermal quadrupole interactions and relativistic corrections\nto the multipole expansion of photon field operators.

To\novercome this, we propose a new microscope that achieves snapshot\ngigapixel-scale imaging with a sensor array and a diffractive optical element\n(DOE). We improve the spatiotemporal throughput in two ways. First, we capture\ndata with an array of 48 sensors resulting in 48x more pixels than a single\nsensor. Second, we use point spread function (PSF) engineering and compressive\nsensing algorithms to fill in the missing information from the gaps surrounding\nthe individual sensors in the array, further increasing the spatiotemporal\nthroughput of the system by an additional >5.4x. The array of sensors is\nmodeled as a single large-format \"super-sensor,\" with erasures corresponding to\nthe gaps between the individual sensors. The array is placed at the output of a\n(nearly) 4f imaging system, and we design a DOE for the Fourier plane that\ngenerates a distributed PSF that encodes information from the entire\nsuper-sensor area, including the gaps. We then computationally recover the\nlarge-scale image, assuming the object is sparse in some domain. Our\ncalibration-free microscope can achieve ~3 {\\mu}m resolution over >5.2 cm^2\nFOVs at up to 120 fps, culminating in a total spatiotemporal throughput of 25.2\nbillion pixels per second.

But the challenges of manufacturing large-scale photonic\nintegrated circuits (PIC) has led to hybrid solutions that integrate optical\nanalog and electronic digital components. A notable example is the coherent\nIsing machine (CIM), that was primarily invented for solving quadratic binary\noptimization problems. In this paper, we focus on a mean-field interpretation\nof the dynamics of optical pulses in the CIM as solutions to Langevin dynamics,\na stochastic differential equation (SDE) that plays a key role in non-convex\noptimization and generative AI. This interpretation establishes a computational\nframework for understanding the system's operation, the computational role of\neach component, and its performance, strengths, and limitations.

If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific\nresonance conditions, the photons produced from decay may destructively\ninterfere. In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound\nstates in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the\nemitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary\nconditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a\nphoton is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the\nemitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number,\nthese two kinds of resonant states are allowed to co-exist in the same\nHamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate\nresonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide\nmode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a\nsingle excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters. We investigate the\nspectrum in a finite range around degeneracy points to check whether the\ndoublet remains well separated from the closest eigenvalues in the spectrum.\nThe identification of quasi-degenerate doublets opens the possibility to\nmanipulate the emitters-waveguide system as an effectively two-level system in\nspecific energy ranges, providing an innovative tool for quantum technology\ntasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u5b50\u5728\u5149\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4e2d\u6210\u5bf9\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u53cc\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u5b50\u5728\u5149\u5bfc\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8272\u5b50\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u548c\u80fd\u7ea7\u5206\u88c2\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f53\u5149\u5bfc\u7ebf\u957f\u5ea6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u5c42\u6b21\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u76f8\u91cd\u53e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u88c5\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Here, we report a\nlight-induced giant enhancement of the NLHE in the two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (111) interface. Under light illumination, the\nsecond harmonic Hall voltage (V2{\\omega} y) increases substantially and\nundergoes a sign reversal. Correspondingly,the second-order transverse\nconductivity increases by nearly five orders of magnitude, reaching 2.4 um V-1\nomega-1, while also reversing its sign. Scaling analysis indicates that skew\nscattering is the dominant mechanism underlying the NLHE and is highly tunable\nvia optical gating. Photoexcitation pumps electrons from in-gap states into the\nhigher-lying Ta 5d conduction band, generating high-mobility photocarriers that\nsignificantly increase the cubic transport scattering time, thereby driving a\ndramatic enhancement of {\\sigma}(2) yxx.

Based on its instantaneous integrability\nand inherent symmetry, we analytically study the magnetization and many-body\ntunneling (MBT). Both of them exhibit periodicity distinct from the driving\nperiod. The magnetization is shown to be independent of the initial state and\nrobust against perturbations, signaling the formation of discrete time crystal\n(DTC) order.

This type of non-Hermitian response can be\nengineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and\nis rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature\ndipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular\ncircular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative\nmedium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and\ngain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred\ndirection parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding\nelectromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force\ncan be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag linked to the nonlinear Hall\ncurrent.

We cross-validate our results on small\nlattices by comparing them with density-matrix renormalization group\ncalculations, finding quantitative agreement. In particular, we implement an\nimproved optimization scheme within the CP-QMC simulations, enabling the\nidentification of a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal phase that was found in\ntensor-network studies on cylindrical geometries, but remains inaccessible to\nHartree-Fock mean-field methods. The CP-QMC approach makes it possible to\nestablish the emergence of this phase in a geometry that preserves lattice\nrotational symmetry and permits extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Our\nresults show that the quantum phase diagram of spinless fermions on the\ncheckerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor repulsion features three\ninteraction-induced phases at half filling: a quantum anomalous Hall insulator\nat weak coupling, a bond-nematic Dirac semimetal at intermediate coupling, and\na site-nematic insulator at strong coupling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u65e0\u81ea\u65cb\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u56fe\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u5f84\u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08CP-QMC\uff09\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\uff1a\u5f31\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\uff0c\u4e2d\u7b49\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u952e\u5f20\u91cf Dirac \u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u683c\u4f4d\u70b9\u9635\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u3002CP-QMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6676\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c Thermodynamic \u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e2d\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u952e\u5f20\u91cf Dirac \u5361\u897f\u5c14\u5fb7\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u76f8\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u67f1\u72b6\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e6\u58c1\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u662f\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e6\u58c1\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u4e92\u4f5c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6750\u6599\u5728 electronic properties \u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e86\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u7269\u7406\u90fd\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u5f84\u91cf\u5b50\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\uff08CP-QMC\uff09\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u7fa4\uff08DMRG\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4 torus \u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5c0f\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86CP-QMC\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u67f1\u72b6\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u952e\u5f20\u91cf Dirac \u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u76f8\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u7ef4\u68cb\u76d8\u683c\u6676\u683c\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u81ea\u65cb\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f02\u5e38\u970d\u5c14\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u3001\u952e\u5f20\u91cf Dirac \u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u548c\u683c\u4f4d\u70b9\u9635\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e4b\u524d\u5728\u67f1\u72b6\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7CP-QMC\u548cDMRG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e6\u58c1\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u76f8\u53d8\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6676\u683c\u65cb\u8f6c\u53d8\u6362\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u5176 Thermodynamic \u6781\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u89e6\u58c1\u6750\u6599\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We optimize their thermodynamic efficiency for any given power\noutput, when they are used as thermoelectric heat-engines or refrigerators. The\nLorentzian's efficiency is excellent at vanishing power, but we find that it is\npoor at the finite powers of practical interest.

It is observed that HF induce moderate perturbation while H$_2$S\ninduce weakest response for all temperature and biasing condition. It is found\nthat an applied vertical electric field narrows the band gap via the Stark\neffect, further boosting mobility and tunability. Temperature influences\nsensing response by enhancing charge transfer at moderate levels and causing\ndesorption at higher temperatures. We found that CO$_2$ consistently show the\nhighest sensitivity and selectivity followed by NO and HF, while H$_2$S display\nthe weakest response.

For the tensor mode, the\nconstraint ability for the detectors scales with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nAt low frequency, due to signal cancellation effects, the SNR registered is\nlower for the detectors with TDI method than that with the simplified equal-arm\nMichelson interferometer method. Therefore, tensor-mode constraints are\ndegraded when TDI is applied. Although the direct detection of extra\npolarizations remains challenging, the constraint ability of the space-based\ndetectors on the vector mode is better than the scalar modes. Besides, the\ndetectability on extra polarizations will be enhanced with TDI, and the\nimprovement of the constraint on the vector mode is less than scalar modes due\nto the inclination-dependent waveforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "In this paper, the authors investigate the constraining capability of space-based gravitational wave detectors on extra polarizations, employing second-generation TDI. They find that the tensor mode constraints are degraded when TDI is used, but the vector mode constraints are better. Detectability is enhanced with TDI, yet the improvement is less for vector modes due to inclination dependence.", "motivation": "Gravitational wave detectors are crucial for testing theories of gravity, and understanding their constraining power on extra polarization modes is important for validating alternative theories. The use of TDI in space-based detectors is relevant as it helps cancel noise, but prior studies have shown mixed results on performance.", "method": "The authors used the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE) waveform framework to model the signals and apply second-generation TDI. They compared the constraints on tensor, vector, and scalar modes under TDI with other interferometer configurations.", "result": "Conditional on low frequency, TDI reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the tensor mode, degrading constraints. Vector mode constraints are improved, but scalar modes are less affected. Inclination dependence impacts detectability aspects.", "conclusion": "This analysis suggests that while TDI enhances certain constraints, the overall lifting of detection prospects for extra polarization modes is limited, especially for tensor modes, which are more impactful for testing gravity theories. Future research may focus on combining TDI with other techniques or exploring detector configurations that utilize inclination."}}

We compute the angular and spectral\nsensitivities of our structure and demonstrate that the angular sensitivity\nreaches values comparable to those of surface plasmon polariton (SPP)-based\nsensors. We observe a blue spectral shift of BICs as the refractive index of\nthe surrounding medium increases, a behavior that differs from the conventional\nspectral response typically expected under such perturbations. Additionally, we\nfound a distinct BIC regime exhibiting a pronounced angular sensitivity,\nsurpassing its spectral one. Our findings pave the way for the development of\ndielectric sensors with high angular sensitivity and facilitate the practical\nobservation of the optical vortex dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ecb\u7535\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\uff08BICs\uff09\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u4ecbylie\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5229\u7528k\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6781\u70b9\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u51fa\u9ad8\u89d2\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5f53\u4ecbylie\u5c5e\u6027\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\uff0cBIC\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u84dd\u8272\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5149\u6f29\u6da1\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u4ecb\u7535\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4ecb\u7535\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u56e0\u5176\u65e0\u5438\u6536\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165BICs\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ecb\u7535\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u675f\u7f1a\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u4ecbylie\u5c5e\u6027\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97k\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6781\u70b9\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u5149\u8c31\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e73\u65b9\u6839\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u84dd\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u671f\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ecb\u7535\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u4ecbylie\u5c5e\u6027\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u89d2\u5ea6\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b80\u4fbf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u65b0\u5947\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c2\u5bdf\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u89d2\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684BIC\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u84dd\u8272\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u671f\u671b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecb\u7535\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ecb\u7535\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e5f\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5149\u6f29\u6da1\u548c\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent American publications define Lunar Coordinate Time (LTC)\nwithin relativity and propose a Terrestrial Time (TT) to LTC conversion\nformula. However, this formula's derivation and assumptions are contested. The\ncomplex dynamics within the solar system can be simplified by decomposing\nrelationships into hierarchical wide-area (external problem) and local-area\n(internal problem) levels. Grounded in the symmetry and conservation laws of\nphysics, Einstein's general relativity emphasizes two key principles: (i) Equal\nweighting: Relationships among multi-level coordinate systems are independent\nand self-similar (analogous to fractals). (ii) *Locality*: The laws of physics\nretain invariant forms only in local coordinate systems. Specifically, a\nnon-rotating system corresponds to the Frenet frame along a particle's\ngeodesic. Preserving physical law invariance requires restricting rotating\nreferences strictly to the local domain; defining the orientation of an\nEarth-centered system using distant celestial bodies violates general\nrelativity's locality principle.

The\ninteraction between the optomechanical system and the spin state generates new\ntransition paths for the destructive quantum interference of the two-photon\nexcitation state. By analytically solving the Schrodinger equation and\nnumerically simulating the master equation, it can be found that the modulated\nmechanical dissipation is essential for achieving the strong photon blockade in\nour system. Unlike the conventional cavity optomechanical system, the\nsecond-order correlation function g(2)(0) =0 can be obtained with the weak\nsingle-photon optomechanical coupling. By adjusting the system parameters, the\nstrong photon blockade and the single-photon resonance can coincide, which\nindicates the hybrid system has the potential to be a high-quality and\nefficient single-photon source. Finally, the influence of the thermal noise on\nphoton blockade is investigated.

Our\nscheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on\narbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The\nalgorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that\nit marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing\nexactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction\nof the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The\nalgorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of\n$O(N^{\\log_2(3)/2}) \\approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively\non two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion\nentirely.

Early examples of\nquantum computational sensing (QCS) have largely focused on protocols where\nonly a single sensing operation appears before measurement -- with an exception\nbeing the recent application of Grover's algorithm to signal detection. In this\npaper we present, in theory and numerical simulations, the application of two\nquantum algorithms -- quantum signal processing and quantum neural networks --\nto various binary and multiclass machine-learning classification tasks in\nsensing. Here sensing operations are interleaved with computing operations,\ngiving rise to nonlinear functions of the sensed signals. We have evaluated\ntasks based on static and time-varying signals, including spatiotemporal\nsignals. Our approach to optimizing the circuit parameters in a QCS protocol\ntakes into account quantum sampling noise and allows us to engineer protocols\nthat can yield accurate results with as few as just a single measurement shot.\nIn all cases, we have been able to show a regime of operation where a quantum\ncomputational sensor can achieve higher accuracy than a conventional quantum\nsensor, with a simulated accuracy advantage of $>$20 percentage points for some\ntasks. We also present protocols for performing nonlinear tasks using\nHamiltonian-engineered bosonic systems and quantum signal processing with\nhybrid qubit-bosonic systems. Overall, we have shown that substantial quantum\ncomputational-sensing advantages can be obtained even if the quantum system is\nsmall, including few-qubit systems, systems comprising a single qubit and a\nsingle bosonic mode, and even just a single qubit alone -- raising the\nprospects for experimental proof-of-principle and practical realizations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u5e94\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f88\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u610f\u5728\u5c55\u793a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u672f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u7a7a\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u566a\u58f0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u529b\u6c42\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9ad8\u8d85\u8fc720\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6216\u5355\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u611f\u5e94\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}
