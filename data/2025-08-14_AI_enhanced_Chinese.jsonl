We meticulously construct\na net of local observable C*-algebras, generated by gauge-invariant composite\noperators such as color-singlet currents and traces of non-Abelian electric\nfields, with the non-Abelian Gauss's law rigorously enforced as an operator\nconstraint. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that no\nDoplicher-Haag-Roberts (DHR) superselection sectors carry nonzero color charge,\nthereby providing a precise and mathematically robust characterization of\nconfinement in these theories. To fully capture the global gauge structure, we\nextend the observable net by incorporating nonlocal Wilson line operators,\nwhich encode string-like color flux configurations essential to the theory's\ntopological properties. We further establish a structural violation of Haag\nduality, showing that certain operators, such as Wilson lines, reside in the\ncommutant of a local algebra but cannot be localized within the algebra of the\ncausal complement, a phenomenon driven by nontrivial topological degrees of\nfreedom. By introducing regularization techniques for operator products and\nproviding detailed derivations, we ensure mathematical precision.

To assess the environmental\nimpacts on surface composition and reaction kinetics, we integrate KS-DFT\ncalculations for predicting surface bonding energy with classical DFT to\nevaluate gas distribution and the grand potential of the entire reactive\nsystem. This multiscale approach accounts for both bond formation and\nnon-bonded interactions of gas molecules with the catalyst surface and reveals\nthat the surface composition is determined not only by chemisorption but also\nby the accessibility of surface sites and their interactions with the\nsurrounding molecules in the gas phase.

The weak deflection angles are\ncalculated using the Gauss-Bonnet method. They decrease with increasing impact\nparameter b and charge Q, but gradually increase with increasing black hole\nmass m. Notably, the presence of a surrounding quintessence field in Rastall\ngravity leads to a higher deflection angle compared to Schwarzschild or\nReissner-Nordstrom black holes with positive Nq. The photon sphere and shadow\nof the black hole are analysed concerning the charge Q and mass m; they shrink\nas Q increases and expand with increasing m. We further analyse the quasinormal\nmodes of the black hole, explicitly derive the coordinate time Lyapunov\nexponent {\\lambda}c and the quasinormal frequency {\\omega}. In the eikonal\nlimit, the Lyapunov exponent ensures that the real and imaginary parts of the\nquasinormal modes can be expressed by the frequency and instability time scale\nof the unstable null circular geodesics. Additionally, we derive the lower\nbounds of the greybody factor Gb; it decreases for increasing charge Q, while\nthe increasing mass m enhances it.

Achieving optimal converter performance\nrequires resonators with high quality factor ($Q$), strong electromechanical\ncoupling ($k^2$), high power handling capability, and a spurious-free response.\nLithium niobate (LN) has emerged as a promising material in this context due to\nits high figure of merit (FoM = $Q \\cdot k^2$). While previous studies on\nsingle-layer LN resonators have demonstrated high FoM values, they typically\noperate at relatively low resonance frequencies ($f_s$). Recently, periodically\npoled piezoelectric film (P3F) structures, formed by stacking piezoelectric\nlayers with alternating crystal orientations, have shown the potential to both\nscale up the operating frequency and enhance the FoM compared to single-layer\ncounterparts in piezoelectric power conversion. This work presents the first\nP3F thickness-extensional (TE) LN resonator for power conversion, operating at\n19.23 MHz, with a large \\textit{$k^2$} of 29\\% and a high \\textit{Q} of 3187,\nachieving a state-of-the-art (\\textit{ $f_s \\cdot Q$}) product among\npiezoelectric power resonators. A high-power testing procedure is performed to\nsystematically study the nonlinear behavior and power handling of P3F LN for\npower applications. With further optimization, P3F TE resonators have the\npotential to open up a new design space for high-power and high-frequency power\nconversion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u54c1\u8d28\u56e0\u6570\u548c\u7535\u78c1\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u7684PPC Hijabdune\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684TE\u578b\u7535\u58f0\u538b\u63a7\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\uff08TE-QTCM\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u7ec4\u4ef6\u572819.23MHz\u7684\u8c10\u632f\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec29%\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u548c3187\u7684\u54c1\u8d28\u56e0\u6570\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u56fd\u9645\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u529f\u7387\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cPPC Hijabdune\u6750\u6599\u4e3a\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u529b\u8f6c\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff08PPC\uff09\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u78c1\u611f\u5e94\u5668\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u9ad8FoM\uff08$f_s \times Q$\uff09\u503c\u7684PPC Hijabdune\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684TE\u578b\u7535\u58f0\u538b\u63a7\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u572819.23MHz\u8c10\u632f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5177\u670929%\u7684$ k^2$\u548c3187\u7684Q\u503c\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u56fd\u9645\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86PPC Hijabdune\u6750\u6599\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7535\u58f0\u538b\u63a7\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\uff08TE-QTCM\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u572819.23MHz\u8c10\u632f\u9891\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176$k^2$\u503c\u4e3a29%\uff0c\u54c1\u8d28\u56e0\u6570$Q$\u4e3a3187\uff0c$f_s \times Q$\u8fbe\u56fd\u9645\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5c55\u671b\u4e86PPC Hijabdune\u6750\u6599\u5728\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86PPC Hijabdune\u6750\u6599\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u58f0\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9891\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

This study investigates hybrid quantum-classical GANs\n(HQCGANs) in which a quantum generator, implemented via parameterised quantum\ncircuits, produces latent vectors for a classical discriminator. We evaluate a\nclassical GAN alongside three HQCGAN variants with 3, 5, and 7 qubits, using\nQiskit's AerSimulator with realistic noise models to emulate near-term quantum\ndevices. The binary MNIST dataset (digits 0 and 1) is used to align with the\nlow-dimensional latent spaces imposed by current quantum hardware. Models are\ntrained for 150 epochs and assessed with Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and\nKernel Inception Distance (KID).

By contrast, when light is\nconfined to the nanoscale and tightly focused beyond the paraxial regime,\nvortex beams exhibit complex electromagnetic structures that transcend these\nconventional models. In this deeply non-paraxial regime, the resulting fields\ndisplay rich and often counterintuitive behaviour, opening new perspectives on\nlight-matter interactions.

We present a study of the phonon interference\neffect on thermal transport in GaAs-GaP superlattice nanowires with sharp\ninterfaces between the GaAs and GaP layers, as confirmed by high-resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy. We performed thermal conductivity\nmeasurements using the so-called thermal bridge method on superlattice\nnanowires with a period varying from 4.8 to 23.3 nm. The measurements showed a\nminimum of the thermal conductivity as a function of superlattice period up to\nroom temperature, that we interpreted as an indication of the crossover from\ncoherent to incoherent thermal transport.

The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific\nvalues of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the\nmodel.

Recent investigations have shown that the locking of\nphase shifts is central to resonant-exchange scattering at low energies.\nMoreover, phase-shift locking causes an unexpected behavior, namely the\nresonant-exchange cross section over a broad range of energies is largely\ndictated by $s$-wave scattering, whose influence extends high above the\n$s$-wave Wigner regime. Here, we generalize our previous treatment to higher\nenergies and derive an analytical expression for the resonant-exchange cross\nsection which depends on a few parameters and accounts not only for the locking\nof phase shifts, but also for their gradual unlocking with increased energy. We\nfind good agreement between the computed (fully quantal) cross sections and\nthose obtained with our expression, which we illustrate in great detail for the\ncase of resonant charge-transfer in ion-atom collisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper discusses resonant-exchange scattering, focusing on phase shift locking and its impact on cross sections at different energy levels, and provides an analytical method to model this behavior.", "motivation": "Understanding low-temperature dynamics and transport phenomena is crucial, especially in fields like condensed matter physics and nuclear physics where scattering processes dominate system behavior.", "method": "The authors generalize their existing model to account for phase shift locking and its gradual release with energy increases, developing an analytical expression for the cross section that considers these factors and validates it through computational results for charge-transfer processes.", "result": "The analytical model accurately predicts resonant-exchange cross sections, demonstrating particularly good agreement when phase shifts are locked, and their method accounts for the transition from s-wave dominance to higher energy contributions.", "conclusion": "This work enhances our understanding of resonant-exchange scattering and provides a valuable tool for predicting cross sections in various systems where phase shifts play a key role."}}

Our\nclassification and insights of optimal energy landscapes offer guidance for\ndesigning efficient transport systems for electronic, photovoltaic and quantum\ncommunication applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u53d7\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u77ed\u94fe\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u8f93\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u9699\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5b50\u4f20\u6001\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Optax\u7684\u4e50\u89c2\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548cAdaMax\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408JAX\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u9699\u5bf9\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5438\u6ce2\u548c\u6563\u5c04\u7b49\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5c0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f20\u8f93\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u8f93\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of\nmassless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\\\"o}m-de Sitter-like\n(RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and\nimaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$.

We further explore the\ndetectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on\nthe detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody\nfactor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability\nof wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the\nincrease of $Q$.

However, we show that in networks of\ncoherently coupled bosonic modes with non-uniform local dissipation, the\npresence of quasi-dark states leads to a nontrivial response to dephasing:\nwhile weak dephasing facilitates equilibration, moderate to strong dephasing\ninduces a pronounced slowdown of relaxation, revealing the existence of an\noptimal dephasing rate that enhances equilibration. Using exact dynamical\nequations for second-order moments, we demonstrate that dephasing suppresses\ncoherent transport and gives rise to long-lived collective modes that dominate\nthe system's late-time behavior.

By focusing on the spin-1/2 transverse-field Ising chain, the authors seek to provide a methodological advance in analyzing integrable systems.", "method": "The authors develop an efficient algorithm for calculating the Bures distance between two Gaussian states.
