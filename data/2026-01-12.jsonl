By calculating the shadow radius and utilizing observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we derive constraints on the quantum parameter $ζ$ and charge parameter $Q$. The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $ζ$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied. Concrete examples are provided for quantitative comparison of the radiation properties between LQRNBH and Schwarzschild black hole. With the ray-tracing method, the isoradial curves, redshift distributions, and the observed radiation fluxes of the direct and secondary images of the LQRNBH with the thin accretion disk for various model parameters and observation angles are numerically calculated and discussed. These results are beneficial for us to understand the physical consequences of loop quantum gravity effect."}

Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $α$. Numerical root-finding locates classical turning points and numerical integration allows comparison with standard WKB results. We find that SWKB and WKB agree when the WKB validity condition holds, while the SWKB yields systematically larger (and plausibly more accurate) tunnelling probabilities for parameter values where the WKB assumptions break down. The results support the SWKB as a useful complementary approach for barrier-transmission studies in quantum cosmology."}

Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times.\n  In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.\n  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era."}

We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~σ$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole."}

We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes.

Notably, the field of topological photonics has emerged in the last decade primarily by simulating tight-binding models of electrons within topologically nontrivial condensed-matter systems. Optical simulation of topologically nontrivial Hamiltonians requires optical resonators with minimal loss and well-matched frequencies whose intersite coupling can also be precisely controlled. The Surface Nanoscale Axial Photonics (SNAP) platform satisfies all these requirements, exhibiting ultra-low loss operation and sub-angstrom fabrication precision, making it an excellent platform for AHS. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the first topologically nontrivial photonic SNAP devices by coupling together axial modes of adjacent SNAP microresonators to form a variety of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The devices manifest numerous distinct topological band structures corresponding to each axial mode of the microresonators, enabling us to observe behavior both close to and far from the topological-trivial phase transition. We further expand the scope of topological SNAP systems to contain not just higher-order generalizations of SSH lattices, but junctions between multiband lattices with dissimilar topological phases created by coupling up to 21 uniform and well-matched SNAP microresonators. Analyzing such \"heterojunctions\" necessitated our development of generalized topological polarization methods. We thus demonstrate the exceptional promise of the SNAP platform for AHS of 1D topological insulators, and also open the door to the potential for simulating >2 dimensional systems by utilizing nonlinear interactions."}

This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor. Results demonstrate accurate contact estimation and localization with errors under 7 mm, demonstrating the potential of whisker-based sensing as a lightweight, adaptable complement to vision-based navigation."}

Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries."}

Both the reflection efficiency and reflection phase of such metamirrors are obtained in closed form and shown to be widely and independently tunable, encompassing ideal electric and magnetic mirror limits with unit reflectivity. Building on these results, we derive explicit analytical expressions that fully describe the optical responses of Fabry-Pérot cavities composed of two such parallel metamirrors. Our combined analytical and numerical investigations reveal that these metamirrors provide exceptional flexibility for tailoring Fabry-Pérot resonances across a broad spectral range, enabling precise control over resonance positions and quality factors. In particular, the framework naturally predicts the emergence of Fabry-Pérot bound states in the continuum with formally infinite Q-factors. These results establish dielectric-metamirror-based Fabry-Pérot cavities as a versatile and fundamentally transparent platform for engineering high-Q optical resonances."}

Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr."}

This article proposes a method to improve the magnetron output characteristics based on regulating its anode current by a novel active distortion eliminator. It takes advantage of the constant current state of MOSFETs to suppress the anode current ripple and eliminate the magnetron output ripples. An improved switch-mode power supply is applied to a 1-kW commercial S -band magnetron in the experiment. The peak-to-peak anode current ripple is reduced from 31 to 7 mA. The spectral width of the free-running magnetron is decreased from 246 to 87 kHz. In the injection locking state, the spur noise is significantly reduced with a maximum suppression strength of 23 dB at a 100-Hz offset. The peak-to-peak value of the magnetron magnitude and phase jitter are suppressed to 15% and 16% of their original values at a power injection ratio of 0.13.

Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design."}

When the refractive index varies periodically in time, multiple time-refractions and -reflections interfere, giving rise to photonic time-crystals (PTCs). Importantly, PTCs display momentum bands separated by gaps in which the modes experience exponential amplification, drawing energy from the modulation in a non-resonant fashion. Ordinary nonlinear optics does not operate in this regime: the material response is either very weak or very slow. One of the immediate consequences is that time-reflection of light at optical frequencies has never been observed in experiments. Here, we experimentally realize an order-unity change in the refractive index occurring at sub-cycle rates, and explore the phenomena emerging from it. By varying the duration of the index change from extending over many cycles to being significantly below a single cycle, we observe that the frequency shift of the time-refraction is enhanced as the index variation occurs faster.

This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications."}

We show theoretically that tuning the rotation frequency, (rather than the interparticle interactions), can trigger the superfluid-to-supersolid transition in Bose-Einstein condensates (dBECs). Computing excitation spectra in the presence of vortices and persistent currents, we uncover a vortex-driven de-softening mechanism whereby quantized vorticity elevates the gapless Goldstone mode to a finite-energy roton, restoring superfluidity. This effect results in re-entrant supersolid phases as a function of rotation frequency, revealing a fundamental coupling between topological defects and crystalline order."}

The cavity's parity-breaking field inside the cavity induces distinct site-energy shifts for left- versus right-handed molecules, producing robust enantioselective polariton states that overcome the weakness of traditional chiroptical effects. Using cavity quantum electrodynamics simulations, we show that strong light-matter coupling reshapes the polaritonic energy landscape and leads to enantiomer-specific coherence lifetimes and relaxation pathways. To reveal these dynamics, we propose ultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) as a probe, capable of resolving polaritonic splittings on femtosecond timescales. Simulated 2DES spectra exhibit unambiguous enantioselective signatures of the cavity-induced asymmetry. These findings establish that chiral cavities provide a powerful platform for detecting and controlling molecular handedness beyond the limits of conventional optical methods."}

We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations."}

A notable example is estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise using the repetition code, which is both optimal for metrology and robust against noise. However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless. To overcome this limitation, we study fault-tolerant quantum metrology where all qubit operations are subject to noise. We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained."}

We present a comparative study of two spectral tailoring approaches using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS): the prepulse and double-pulse (DP) methods. In the prepulse scheme, a high-intensity pulse induces Rabi oscillations, modulating the 2D spectral amplitude and lineshape when its spectral bandwidth matches the ensemble full width at half maximum (FWHM). To overcome this limitation, the DP method employs variable inter-pulse delay to generate predetermined periodic spectral modulation without bandwidth constraints. Moreover, tuning the relative phase between DP pulses allows selective switching of frequency components, enabling controlled enhancement or suppression of distinct spectral features. These observations highlight that, while the prepulse approach is constrained by spectral bandwidth, the DP method provides a more versatile and reliable route to manipulate the coherent optical response of inhomogeneous ensembles. We are hoping these findings might stimulate further research in optical switching and coherent storage for quantum memory devices using inhomogeneous ensembles."}

Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design."}

In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology."}

In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles."}

We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV.

The research combines both experimental and theoretical investigations, utilizing the differential microwave dielectrometry method and numerical modeling with COMSOL software. Complex permittivity (CP) values dependence of IgG water solutions on the protein concentration was experimentally obtained at the microwaves using original microwave dielectrometer setup. It was shown that increase of IgG concentration resulted in the CP values of the solutions studied decrease. The experimentally obtained CP data for the IgG water solutions were used as a basis for microwave metal-dielectric metasurface unit cell numerical modeling. The metal-dielectric metasurface consisting of Teflon substrate and plane copper microresonators was combined with a standard 96-well microplate used in clinical laboratories. Optimization of the obtained metasurface unit cell revealed that the size and position of the copper microresonators within the unit cell significantly impact the sensor sensitivity for determining the IgG concentration in aqueous solutions. The metasurface with the unit cell containing four copper microresonators provided the most sensitive platform for detecting variations in the IgG concentration in the sample. The frequency shift of the reflection coefficient was directly related to changes in the protein concentration. The calibration graph was developed for effective determination of IgG concentrations in the aqueous solutions."}

By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design."}

We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes.

This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing."}

This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy."}

In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer.

The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles.

Our gain medium is pentacene dissolved as a solid solution with para-terphenyl (Pc:PTP) molecular crystal. We accurately determine this pentacene's molecular absorption cross-section as a function of wavelength.

Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work."}

We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We anticipate photon distillation will find uses in large-scale quantum computers. We also expect this work to inspire the search for additional intrinsically bosonic error-reduction strategies, even for fault-tolerant architectures."}

This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems."}

To our knowledge, various aspects remain unexplored and a holistic parameter selection method remains to be developed. After reviewing key QPE features, we propose a constructive method to set the QPE free parameters. We derive, among other things, explicit conditions for achieving chemical accuracy in ground energy estimation. We also demonstrate that, using our conditions, the complexity of the Trotterized version of QPE tends to depend only on physical system properties and not on the number of phase qubits.

In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduced, a robust power-law decay emerges already at short times, driven by photon diffusion in the dynamically disordered environment rather than spectral edge effects.

Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble. We account for realistic loss and finite memory and retrieval efficiencies, and model readout as a single-mode beam-splitter mapping that transfers the atomic quadrature squeezing onto a propagating optical mode. We identify optimal storage times and predict that, under realistic conditions, several dB of squeezing can be transferred to the retrieved light."}

We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis.

Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors. While quantum error correction can address such errors in principle, it is highly resource-intensive and operates with a low error threshold, requiring numerous high-quality optical components. We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We anticipate photon distillation will find uses in large-scale quantum computers. We also expect this work to inspire the search for additional intrinsically bosonic error-reduction strategies, even for fault-tolerant architectures."}

Our method requires a small number of ancillary qubits, whose interaction with the system$-$combined with classical post-processing of joint measurement data$-$is tailored to cancel the effect of noise.

Specifically, we map the molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit representation and construct an adiabatic Hamiltonian, from which an approximate adiabatic gauge potential is computed using nested commutators. The resulting operator terms define the operator pool, and the ADAPT-VQE algorithm is applied to iteratively select the most relevant elements for the ansatz.

By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity."}

We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation."}

Distinguishing these two channels is essential for interpreting nonlinear and quantum-optical experiments based on high-$n$ states, yet their temporal, spectral, and power-dependent signatures often overlap. Here we use time-resolved resonant two-photon excitation to cleanly separate SHG and SE and to map how each depends on $n$, temperature, excitation power, and crystal quality. This approach reveals the markedly different sensitivities of the two processes to phonons, defects, and many-body effects, and establishes practical criteria for identifying SE and SHG in a wide range of experimental conditions.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of atomic gases have been an ideal platform for studying many-body quantum phenomena, such as superfluidity, and simultaneously providing an opportunity to broaden our understanding of classical hydrodynamics into quantum systems. In this review, we introduce a range of experimental studies on the pattern formation in quantum fluids of atomic gases under external driving, including Faraday waves in one and two dimensions, surface patterns, and counterflow instabilities in a mixture of superfluids. The pattern formation in the quantum system can be understood through the parametric amplification process, where an unstable dynamical mode can be exponentially amplified, similar to classical systems. Remarkably, the governing equations for surface excitations of trapped BECs can be mathematically equivalent to those of shallow water, indicating a universal description of the hydrodynamic instability across classical and quantum domains. However, the condensates, as superfluids, also possess fundamental quantum characteristics, such as quantized vorticity and a distinct dissipation channel. These unique features showcase many-body fragmentation under strong modulation and the generation of vortices in the nonlinear regime, which could offer a pathway to the study of quantum turbulence. Furthermore, the coexistence of long-range phase coherence and density modulation in driven condensates could provide unexplored features, such as those seen in supersolid-like sound modes, within nonequilibrium settings."}
