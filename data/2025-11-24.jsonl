In this paper, we determine spatially-bounded rogue waves in the Davey-Stewartson I equation. We show that these rogue waves can be obtained when a single or multiple internal parameters in the higher-order rational solution of the Davey-Stewartson I equation are real and large, and the order-index vector of this higher-order rational solution has even length and comprises pairs of the form (2n, 2n+1), where n is a positive integer. Under these conditions and another nondegeneracy condition on the root curve of a certain double-real-variable polynomial, the higher-order rational solution will exhibit spatially-bounded rogue waves that arise from a uniform background with some time-varying lumps on it, reach high amplitude in limited space, and then disappear into the same background again. The crests of these rogue waves form a single or multiple closed curves that are generically disconnected from each other on the spatial plane, and are analytically predicted by the root curve mentioned above. We also derive uniformly-valid asymptotic approximations for these spatially-bounded rogue waves in the large-parameter regime. Near the crests of these rogue waves, these asymptotic approximations reduce to simple expressions. Our asymptotic approximations of these rogue waves are compared to true solutions and good agreement is demonstrated."}

We prepare the atomic ensemble by driving the system to its steady state with varying Rabi frequencies $Ω$ that go from the weak $Ω\\ll Γ$ to the strong driving regime $Ω\\gg Γ$, where $Γ$ is the single-atom decay rate. We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study."}

In addition to recording lightning flash currents on the monitored turbine, the system is frequently triggered by electromagnetic disturbances caused by nearby lightning flashes. These include direct flashes to two neighboring turbines that share the same cable connection to the substation and have interconnected grounding systems with buried bare conductor, as well as cloud-to-ground flashes to soil near cable routes, where the resulting electromagnetic fields couple onto the cables, causing surges to propagate to the monitored turbine. The camera occasionally captures failed upward connecting leaders from the monitored turbine during these lightning events. This paper presents three cases of flashes to two neighboring wind turbines and two cases of cloud-to-ground flashes to nearby soil, all of which induced electromagnetic transients that propagated to the monitored turbine.

By adding an amorphous Si (a-Si) buffer to the n-InN/p-Si structure, we have improved the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices while maintaining their material quality. We have firstly optimized the deposition of Si on Si(100) by DC sputtering, obtaining an amorphous material with bandgap energy of 1.39 eV. Then we have studied the influence of the thickness of the a-Si buffer layer (0-25 nm) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of InN nanowires on Si (100) substrates. With the use of a 15-nm buffer, n-InN/a-Si/p-Si nanowire heterojunction solar cells exhibit a promising short-circuit current density of 17 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 0.37 V and fill factor of 35.5%, pointing to a power-conversion efficiency of 2.3% under 1-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination.

In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953."}

We propose an axiomatic reformulation in which a chemical system is modelled as a ternary Gamma semiring (TGS), where chemical states form an additive semigroup, mediators encode catalytic or environmental context, and mediated transformations are represented by a ternary operation. We show that the TGS axioms admit direct physical interpretations: distributivity corresponds to ideal, non-interfering parallel reactions, while associativity characterizes thermodynamic path-independence. Classical systems including Michaelis-Menten kinetics, global equilibrium, and allosteric regulation are recovered as different algebraic regimes, and we develop operational tests that quantify departures from the axioms through experimentally measurable indices. The resulting framework unifies equilibrium, kinetics, regulation, and chemical computation within a single algebraic language, offering new principles for the analysis and design of responsive or self-regulating materials."}

We also use them to compare two spin-gauge choices: the well-known Damour-Jaranowski-Schäfer ($\\rm DJS$) gauge, in which the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions are independent of the orbital angular momentum, and the alternative anti-$\\rm DJS$ (or $\\overline{\\rm DJS}$) gauge, designed to reproduce in the test-mass limit the spin-orbit interaction of a spinning test particle in a Kerr background.

This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper."}

We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz.

This powerful ability greatly reduces the time and money required to study superconductivity.

To establish fundamental principles of dynamic photon-modulated catalysis, the photocatalytic conversion of a generic surface reaction was simulated to understand the kinetic implications of an independent stream of photons promoting surface product desorption. Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux). The maximum photocatalytic rate occurred orders of magnitude above the Sabatier limit at the resonance frequency, identified as the photon arrival frequency that matched the surface reaction rate constant. Non-equilibrium photocatalytic conversion occurred when the rate of photon-promoted product desorption was comparable to the rate of thermal product desorption. Results indicated the general utility of photon-promoted catalysis, with negligible benefit for rate enhancement and quantum yield with photon source pulsing or chopping due to the inherent dynamic nature of photons from light sources."}

Within the LISA sensitivity range, the GWB signal is a flat or a broken power law, parametrized by four fundamental quantities: the Hubble parameter at the curvature bounce $H_1$, the axion mass $m$, the initial amplitude of the axion field $σ_i$ and the exponent $β$ governing the high-energy growth of the dilaton and the dynamics of the internal dimensions. We determine the posterior distributions of these parameters based on how LISA would detect such signal. Including the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds in the analysis, the most stringent constraints on $H_1$, $σ_i$ and $β$ are obtained when the signal exhibits a left-bend feature, while for $m$ this happens for a right-bend feature. Relative uncertainties reach $ΔH_1/H_1 ,\\,Δm/m \\sim 18\\%$ at $68\\%$ confidence level under favourable conditions.

This analysis is based on numerical simulations of the channeling process, which were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. Ionising collisions are considered random, fast and local events, and are incorporated into the classical relativistic molecular dynamics framework according to the previously described algorithm. The case studies presented refer to 10 GeV electrons and positrons incident on single crystals of diamond and silicon, oriented along the (110) and (111) planes, with thicknesses of up to 1 mm for electrons and 6 mm for positrons. To elucidate the role of ionising collisions, simulations were performed with and without accounting for them. It is shown that, for electrons, both approaches lead to similar results with regard to both the channelling efficiency and the radiation intensity. In practical terms, this means that numerical simulations can be carried out without accounting for ionising collisions, which are much faster yet produce similar results. For positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, their impact on the radiation intensity strongly depends on the opening angle of the cone within which the radiation emission is collected. A quantitative analysis of this feature is presented in the paper."}

In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management.

For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes."}

Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits."}

The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT).

Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures."}

Through explicit application of the optical metric formulation of TO, we demonstrate that any smooth, passive, impedance-matched transformation performs as a canonical (symplectic) mapping on optical phase space. In combination with Hamiltonian ray dynamics, this indicates that Liouville theorem is as well applicable to TO media: the phase-space volume element is preserved, radiance remains constant along rays, and etendue won't decrease under any passive TO mapping. Based on this novel notion, which has never been mentioned in TO literature before, we develop a radiance-invariant phase-space measure specific to TO media. We then utilize it to find severe analytical limitations on field enhancement. We demonstrate that the maximum attainable average intensity in any passive TO concentrator is exclusively constrained by the area-compression ratio of the coordinate mapping, irrespective of material implementation. Using the same paradigm on zero-index media, optical-null media, and illusion devices reveals the same rules. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that transformation optics (TO) can redistribute intensity but cannot increase radiance, and they give a Liouville-type theorem within this field.

Using optical profilometry with curvature fitting, we extract the stress gradient (sigma1) and generate orientation-resolved stress maps across multiple film thicknesses (100 nm, 220 nm, and 460 nm). For films in the 220 to 460 nm range, we identify stress-free in-plane orientations near approximately 55 degrees and 125 degrees, enabling extremely flat suspended beams. In contrast, ultra-thin 100 nm films exhibit shifted stress-free orientations near approximately 20 degrees and 160 degrees. Leveraging these orientations, we demonstrate very long suspended beams up to 2 cm in length, 10 micrometers in width, and 460 nm in thickness without collapse. These results establish in-plane stress anisotropy and thickness selection in TFLN as practical design levers for mechanically stable, scalable, and stress-managed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)."}

Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature."}

Quantum and neuromorphic computing rely on unconventional materials and device functionalities, yet achieving resilience to imperfections and reliable operation remains a major challenge. This has motivated growing interest in topological materials that provide robust and low-power operation while preserving coherence. However, integrating coherent topological transport with non-volatile memory functionality in a single reconfigurable device has remained challenging. In this work, we demonstrate a topological field-effect memristor based on inverted InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum wells operating in the quantum spin Hall regime. The intrinsic floating-gate behavior allows one to reconfigure the transistor functionality into memristive functionality with broad electric-field tunability. Unlike other memristor implementations, one resistance state is governed entirely by dissipationless, coherent transport through helical edge channels, while the other arises from incoherent bulk conduction. By combining electrically tunable coherent and incoherent transport with memory functionality, our device realizes a prototypical topological electronic element that integrates coherent transport and adaptive memristive behavior, paving the way for hybrid quantum-neuromorphic architectures."}

We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles."}

Working within the tetrad formalism, we solve the Dirac equation for several configurations of the angular momentum density $J_t$ and the torsion parameter $J_z$ that are relevant from a physical perspective. These configurations include balanced torsion ($J_t = J_z$), pure spinning strings ($J_z = 0$), pure screw dislocations ($J_t = 0$) and the general case. In all cases, the geometry modifies an effective azimuthal quantum number, and for strong rotation it introduces a geometric radial cutoff $ρ_c$ that acts as a hard wall. These factors lead to closed-form expressions for the radial wave functions, phase shifts and differential cross sections, which are expressed in terms of confluent hypergeometric and Bessel functions. We demonstrate that conical curvature, rotation and torsion generate Aharonov-Bohm-like contributions, as well as energy- and momentum-dependent asymmetries in Dirac-Coulomb scattering. This results in topology-renormalised Mott/Rutherford patterns. In the Coulomb-free limit, scattering becomes purely geometric yet still exhibits characteristic forward enhancement, which is governed by defect parameters and the cutoff. We briefly discuss possible realisations in Dirac materials, such as strained or defective graphene, where lattice disclinations and dislocations mimic the cosmic-string geometry."}

This approximation can introduce significant artifacts, including deviations in the dynamical evolution and a violation of the principle of detailed balance. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce an electronic thermostat into our previously developed orbital surface hopping (OSH) framework, generalizing the method to efficiently handle many discrete electronic states. We first outline the derivation of electronic thermostat orbital surface hopping, where the amplitude of the electronic thermostat is well justified. We then demonstrate that this method can reproduce accurate dynamics and detailed balance in long time, whereas without electronic thermostat the detailed balance is violated. Thus, this method offers a reliable tool for studying nonadiabatic dynamics near metal surfaces."}

The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\\% credibility and in agreement with previous results.

Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum.

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains. We also discuss how the correlated phase of the isolated chain is characterized by boundary zeros in its single-particle Green's function, and briefly comment on their localization properties in relation to the boundary spins."}

Motivated by these experiments, we perform molecular dynamics simulations using a multicoverage potential energy surface that was previously constructed with the embedded atom neural network method. The process is modeled by combining the two-temperature model (2TM)--to describe the laser-excited electrons and phonons--and Langevin dynamics with electronic time-dependent temperature $T_\\textrm{e}$--to model the coupling of the nuclei degrees of freedom with the laser-excited electrons. We show that improving the energy balance description in 2TM--by including \\textit{ab-initio} $T_\\textrm{e}$-dependent electronic heat capacity and electron-phonon coupling constant--is key to reproduce the asymmetry of the photodesorption probability $P_{\\rm des}$ between positive and negative time delays. Furthermore, we also explore possible reasons for the usual underestimation of $P_{\\rm des}$ at zero delay given by state-of-the-art calculations. In particular, we improve the description of the energy exchange between CO and the metal surface at high $T_\\textrm{e}$ by including in the simulations a $T_\\textrm{e}$-dependent friction coefficient. The prediction for $P_{\\rm des}$ at zero delay in this case, increases by an order of magnitude, reducing its discrepancy with the experimental value. Altogether, our results hint to the importance of accounting for the temperature dependence of the electronic structure and properties in describing the extreme conditions generated in 2PC experiments."}

The most important advantage of TMT as an alternative theory is that, under the conditions under which all classical tests of general relativity are performed, TMT models are able to accurately reproduce Einstein's general relativity. Despite this, TMT is still often perceived as something too exotic to be relevant to reality. In fact, the fundamental idea underlying TMT seems undeniable: if we truly believe in the effectiveness of mathematics in studying nature, we must agree that there must be a correspondence between the fundamental laws of nature and the structure of the mathematical apparatus necessary to adequately describe them. It then turns out that there is no reason to ignore the volume measure existing on the differentiable manifold on which the theory of gravity and matter fields is built. This idea has far-reaching implications. The goals of this paper are: 1) to provide a clear mathematical and conceptual justification for TMT; 2) to collect in a single article some of the main results of TMT obtained over the past 25 years."}

Bridging the behavior observed in 1D and 3D systems, the $T_1^{-1}$ relaxation rate shows a pronounced peak extending well above the Néel temperature $T_N$, indicating strong two-dimensional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type fluctuations. A quantitative match between experimental and theoretical BEC phase boundaries validates an effective XXZ model. The study determines the intrinsic BKT transition temperature $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}$ from QMC, revealing a nearly field-independent $T_{\\mathrm{BKT}}/T_N \\approx 0.74$. Scaling analysis of the relaxation rate shows critical exponents consistent with 2D universality, and a narrow temperature window is identified where 2D physics dominates.

Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim."}

Of particular interest is the regime where the interacting electrons exhibit both spin and valley degeneracy, resulting in SU(4) Kondo physics. However, this regime is challenging to realize in typical mesoscopic systems because it requires a strong interaction between electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature ($T_\\mathrm{K}$) significantly larger than the spin and valley splittings. Here, we present conductance measurements of a quantum point contact (QPC) in bilayer graphene (BLG). Beyond the expected quantized conductance plateaus, which reflect spin and valley degeneracy, we observe an additional subband, known as `0.7 anomaly' exhibiting signatures of Kondo physics and a $T_\\mathrm{K}$ ranging from approximately 0.5 up to 2.4 K at zero magnetic field, corresponding to Kondo energies between 40 and 200 $μ$eV. Given that the spin-orbit splitting in BLG is between 40 and 80 $μ$eV, we argue that these results are consistent with a transition between four-fold degenerate SU(4) and two-fold degenerate spin-valley locked SU(2) Kondo effects. Furthermore, we break the valley degeneracy of the lowest subband by an out-of-plane magnetic field and show that Kondo signatures remain present, indicating a transition from SU(4) to a valley-polarized SU(2) Kondo effect, and showing the versatility of BLG QPCs for exploring many-body effects."}

The OKG technique offers high detection efficiency over a broad spectral range, making it particularly promising for ultrafast single-photon detection at high-repetition-rates. Here, we present an ultrafast scheme based on the third-order nonlinearity of bismuth borosilicate (BBS) glass, operating at a 1 GHz repetition rate with less than 1 nJ pulse energy under focusing, and achieving a time resolution down to 175 fs.

By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics."}

The corresponding excess molar volumes were calculated from these density measurements. In addition, excess molar enthalpies at 298.15 K and 0.1 MPa were measured using a Tian-Calvet micro-calorimeter. The results show that alkanol-ether interactions are strong but do not contribute significantly to the excess molar enthalpy, as the values are large and positive, and comparable to those of (glyme + n-heptane) systems. The excess molar volumes are small or even negative (in the case of the mixture with u = 4), indicating that they are mainly governed by structural effects. Mixtures with 1-propanol or 2-propanol behave similarly, although interactions between unlike molecules become slightly stronger when 1-propanol is involved. On the other hand, effects related to alcohol self-association play a decisive role in the thermodynamic properties when glymes are replaced by di-n-propyl ether. This is supported by the application of the Flory model, which shows that orientational effects are weak in the studied glyme-containing mixtures but become significantly stronger when di-n-propyl ether is considered."}

Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables."}

We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons."}

While unconventional spin transport phenomena have been predominantly explored in low-symmetry systems (e.g., $C_{1v}$ symmetry), high-symmetry crystals--which constitute the majority of industry-compatible materials--are generally expected to exhibit only conventional spin-transport behavior. Here, we report the coexistence of two unconventional spin transport effects, the crystal spin-orbit torque (CSOT) and the crystal in-plane Hall effect (CIHE), in a CoPt single ferromagnetic layer with $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Leveraging the CSOT, we achieve nearly 100% field-free perpendicular magnetization switching in a 6 nm CoPt layer at room temperature. Simultaneously, the CIHE observed in this material exhibits nearly identical dependencies on both current angle and growth temperature as the CSOT. Symmetry analysis confirms that both effects share a common physical origin. Our work not only establishes CoPt as a high-performance spin-orbit material, but also demonstrates that unconventional spin transport can be realized in high-symmetry systems, thereby opening a broad pathway for their application in practical spintronics."}

This formalism has led to striking developments in the context of perturbative scattering, which corresponds to large impact parameter scattering. As a result, in its current form, the KMOC formulae can not be directly applied to processes for generic values of the impact parameter. However, there is a domain where the relationship between classical radiation and on-shell amplitudes can be stretched beyond large impact parameter scattering. This regime is defined by the soft expansion of outgoing radiation. It is thus natural to ask if such soft radiative fields can be computed using the basic paradigm set by the KMOC formalism. In this short note, we show that this is indeed the case for electromagnetic memory. That is, we compute an inclusive observable associated with soft flux at ${\\cal I}^{+}$ and show that, irrespective of the details of the hard scattering, this observable defines a non-perturbative formula for electromagnetic memory in the classical limit.

We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $λ^{-2}$, where $λ$ is the perturbation strength."}

The electromagnetic sector is governed by a Generalized Nonlinear Electrodynamics (GNED) Lagrangian obtained from a root-$T\\bar T$ deformation constructed via the Courant--Hilbert approach, ensuring both duality invariance and causal propagation. This theory contains ModMax, Generalized Born-Infeld (GBI), and self-dual logarithmic electrodynamics as continuous limits. Within this framework we obtain exact charged AdS black hole solutions and perform a detailed study of their thermodynamic properties, including mass, temperature, entropy, and free energy. The resulting phase structure exhibits van der~Waals-type transitions between small and large black holes and features a characteristic swallowtail in the free energy at the critical point.\n  We further investigate the internal geometry and show that the nature of the central singularity is determined by the matter fields sourcing the spacetime. Analysis of the Kretschmann scalar demonstrates how gravity and electromagnetism jointly control curvature blow-up in charged and ModMax black holes, with gravity providing the leading divergence. In contrast, (GBI) and logarithmic (NED) models imprint distinct singularity profiles governed by the specific functional form of their Lagrangians. Examining the near-origin behavior of the metric allows us to identify the parameter ranges that support an event horizon and to determine when the solution instead becomes a naked singularity. Overall, the comparison across models reveals that different causal NED theories produce identifiable signatures in both the strength of the singularity and the conditions for horizon formation."}

We refine the calculation made in previous works: we impose Hermiticity on the induced metric and fix the expansion of the determinant for matrix valued fields. Implementing these improvements yields modified fluctuation equations and quantitatively different meson spectra: the scalar modes become heavier while the vector modes become lighter, removing the degeneracy reported in the literature.

Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry."}

Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure.

We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 <= x <= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems."}

This scheme achieves 10% detection efficiency with sub 50 ns time resolution and short dead time 1 microsecond, for microwave photons at 10 GHz. The detector features three junctions connected to a superconducting island, which together carry out photoelectric conversion and charge readout. The enhanced light-matter coupling, crucial to photon to quasiparticle conversion, is provided by a granular aluminum-based high-impedance microwave resonator.

In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles.

Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches.

We propose that localized spins near the ends of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard chain embedded in an insulating environment can be detected experimentally using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) combined with electron spin resonance (ESR). When the STM tip is in the contact regime, the tip-end-spin coupling realizes an effective Anderson impurity problem, giving rise to a Kondo peak at low bias. Spatially resolving the Kondo resonance width as the STM tip approaches the chain ends provides an indirect yet clear signature of these localized spins. To support this proposal, we use density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) to calculate the spin gap and spin projection of end states for chains of various lengths and interaction strengths $U$ at half-filling. In the non-interacting limit ($U=0$), we derive simple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for sufficiently long chains.

We determine the posterior distributions of these parameters based on how LISA would detect such signal. Including the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds in the analysis, the most stringent constraints on $H_1$, $σ_i$ and $β$ are obtained when the signal exhibits a left-bend feature, while for $m$ this happens for a right-bend feature.

Importantly, we observed strong nonclassical correlations after storage, with cross-correlation values of $g_{s,i}^{(2)} = 8.1\\pm0.7$. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating cavity-enhanced photon-pair sources with rare-earth-ion-doped solid-state memories.

The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\\% credibility and in agreement with previous results.

Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement.

Efficient cooling is therefore crucial both for advancing our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and for enabling the development of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we devise a cooling task that exploits steerability, a fundamental form of quantum correlations, to demonstrate a provable quantum advantage over classically correlated scenarios in which steerability is absent. We quantify this advantage by the ratio between the heat removed using steerable quantum correlations and the heat removed using unsteerable classical correlations. Specifically, we show that steerable quantum correlations always provide a thermodynamic advantage in the cooling task. Remarkably, we further establish that the maximum achievable advantage is directly related to a geometric measure of steerability known as steerability robustness. Our results suggest that this thermodynamic advantage can serve as a witness of steerability. Finally, we present examples showing that the advantage can increase with the dimension of the underlying system."}

In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions.

Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR."}

Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state. Violation of this alternative inequality implies the entanglement of the resulting state given the assumption of a separable initial state, under less stringent thermal constraints than the general entanglement witness. Our results are applicable to all Raman-scattering systems which can exhibit sufficient degrees of quantum indistinguishability."}

There were numerous problems this experiment and how it was interpreted. First, the experiment is not observing stationary states as claimed, but rather the time-averaged density of wave pulses which reflect off the potential step. Second, the proposed method for measuring a propagation speed is shown to be invalid for true stationary states. Third, the invalid method was misapplied to the time-averaged density, and this is shown to have created the false impression that it yields correct speed values for stationary states. These issues notwithstanding, for a wavefunction $ψ= Re^{iS/\\hbar}$, the velocity of interest, $\\vec{v}_s = -\\frac{\\hbar}{m}\\frac{\\vec{\\nabla}R}{R}$, is different than the Bohm velocity $\\vec{v}_B=\\frac{1}{m}\\vec{\\nabla}S$, and may be nonzero for stationary states.

We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models.

Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry."}

Here, we investigate its impact on the thermodynamic processes generated by thermalizing quantum channels. We consider a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths under a quantum SWITCH, with the channel order controlled coherently by an ancillary qubit. We derive closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature $β_f$ of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures, and identify the control-qubit parameters that maximize heating or cooling. Our analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute separately to the temperature shift, and how their interplay enables departures from the thermal response attainable under any fixed causal order. Bath asymmetry enhances these effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them. These results provide a systematic framework for assessing the thermodynamic capabilities of ICO and clarify the role of quantum coherence as a tunable thermodynamic resource."}

The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures.

We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit.

Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \\emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model.

For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes."}
