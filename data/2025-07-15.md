### [1] [PTM-Psi on the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09014)
*Suman Samantray,Margot Lockwood,Amity Andersen,Hoshin Kim,Paul Rigor,Margaret S. Cheung,Daniel Mejia-Rodriguez*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: The paper presents a cloud-based solution for accelerating PTM simulations using workflow orchestration, achieving high throughput and reduced complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing efficient protein modification simulations is essential for understanding cellular processes, particularly in metabolomics and biotechnology.

Method: Used a flow-of-workflow approach on Azure Quantum Elements with tools like Alphafold2, NWChem, GROMACS, and Python, optimizing resource allocation for PTM-Psi simulations on a cyanobacteria protein complex.

Result: Achieved high-throughput simulation, reduced operational complexity, and cost savings in PTM analysis, ideal for metabolomics and biotech applications.

Conclusion: The cloud-based PTM-Psi framework significantly enhances the efficiency and accessibility of protein modification studies, promising broader impacts in biotechnology.

Abstract: We developed an advanced computational architecture to accelerate
Post-Translational Modifications on protein structures and interactions
(PTM-Psi) simulations utilizing asynchronous, loosely coupled workflows on the
Azure Quantum Elements platform. The cloud architecture harnessed inherent task
parallelism to enhance simulation throughput and dynamically allocate
computational resources to optimize efficiency. Here, we seamlessly integrate
emerging cloud computing assets that further expand the scope and capability of
PTM-Psi simulations beyond current limitations. By refactoring the existing
PTM-Psi workflow using well-established software, including Alphafold2, NWChem,
GROMACS, and Python-based analysis tools into a cloud-native library, we
optimized resource allocation tailored to each workflow's needs for scaling up
the PTM-Psi simulation. We employed a ``flow-of-workflow'' approach in which
the cloud architecture supports the computational investigation of a
combinatorial explosion of thiol PTMs on an exemplary protein megacomplex
critical to the Calvin-Benson cycle of light-dependent sugar production in
cyanobacteria. With PTM-Psi on the cloud, we transformed the pipeline for the
thiol PTM analysis to achieve high throughput by leveraging the strengths of
the cloud service. PTM-Psi on the cloud reduces operational complexity and
lowers entry barriers to data interpretation with structural modeling for a
redox proteomics mass spectrometry specialist.

### [2] [Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Analysis of Isolated Melanosomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09114)
*Mykyta Kizilov,Sujeong Jung,Vsevolod Cheburkanov,Vladislav V. Yakovlev*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This discovery shows that the fluorescent properties of pigments in melanosomes change quickly due to structural changes after irradiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to explore how the structural changes in melanin affect their fluorescence properties, which could have implications for understanding photoprotection mechanisms in melanosomes.

Method: The researchers used FLIM, a method that measures fluorescence lifetimes, to observe how the lifetimes of fluorescent emissions in melanosomes evolve over time when exposed to extended laser irradiation.

Result: They found that there is a short-lived fluorescence component and significant changes in lifetimes upon irradiation, which are attributed to structural modifications in melanin occurring within minutes to one hour.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that structural photoinduced changes in melanin are correlated with changes in fluorescence lifetimes, offering insights into the mechanisms of photoprotection in melanosomes.

Abstract: Melanosomes are organelles found in a wide variety of tissues throughout the
animal kingdom. They contain a variety of biological molecules, but the
dominant constituent is the pigment melanin, and many functions ascribed to
melanosomes, such as photoprotection, are uniquely enabled by the chemical
properties and structures of the melanins they contain. In this report, we
used, for the first time, Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to
examine fluorescent properties of pigments in melanosomes and evaluate their
time evolution upon extended laser irradiation. We discovered a relatively
short-lived component in fluorescence emission and revealed significant changes
in lifetimes upon irradiation indicating structural photoinduced changes to
melanin occurring on a time scale of minutes, with observations extending up to
one hour.

### [3] [Probing the single neurotransmitters with the WGM microcavity-hybridized plasmonic nanospiked antennas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10146)
*Aneeth Kakkanattu Arunkumar,Ekaterina Zossimova,Michael Walter,Srikanth Pedireddy,Jolly Xavier,Frank Vollmer*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces an optoplasmonic WGM sensor for detecting neurotransmitters with high sensitivity. It can detect down to 10 aM and distinguish between structurally similar neurotransmitters like GABA and glutamate, contributing to understanding neurological disorders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting low-concentration neurotransmitters, which are crucial for understanding neurological disorders.

Method: The method involves using WGM sensors hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas to detect neurotransmitters at single-molecule level. They measure sensitivity and correlate WGM shifts with electronic structure calculations.

Result: The sensor shows excellent sensitivity (down to 10 aM) and can distinguish structurally similar neurotransmitters. Correlates WGM shifts with molecular polarizability.

Conclusion: This optoplasmonic platform could be a valuable tool for biosensing in neuroscience, aiding in understanding brain function and disorders.

Abstract: Discerning the neurotransmitter dysregulation is a hallmark of neurological
disorders and diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple
sclerosis. The concentration of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft is
particularly low, ranging from nM to fM, which makes it challenging to
accurately monitor changes over the course of a clinical trial using existing
sensing techniques. By means of an advanced whispering gallery mode (WGM)
sensor hybridized with plasmonic nanospiked antennas, we detect and
discriminate between different neurotransmitters at the single-molecule level.
Our results show that the sensor can detect neurotransmitters with exceptional
sensitivity down to 10 aM and discriminate between structurally similar
neurotransmitters, such as GABA and glutamate, over a large number of detection
events. Furthermore, we find that the average WGM resonance shift, induced by a
neurotransmitter binding to the sensor, strongly correlates with molecular
polarizability values obtained from electronic structure calculations. These
findings establish the optoplasmonic WGM sensors as potential biosensor
platform in different avenues of neuroscience by detecting and discriminating
neurotransmitters as well as investigating their dynamics at ultra low-level
concentrations, plausibly contributing to deeper understanding of brain
function and neurological disorders.

### [4] [Exogeneous PpIX model for brain tumour assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10230)
*John Raschke,Jean Pierre Ndabakuranye,Bobbi Fleiss,Arman Ahnood*

Main category: physics.bio-ph

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一种外源性脑肿瘤模型用于检测PpIX荧光，通过注射高浓度PpIX溶液到动物大脑中，模仿 actual glioma 轮廓。结果显示模型与体内条件下的结果高度校正，R²>0.93。此外，研究还测试了溶剂对背景自发光（AF）的影响，并建议在Hanks缓冲液中冷冻保存样品以确保AF稳定。该模型为荧光检测设备在临床前开发提供了可靠的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者希望开发更可靠的荧光检测设备，但现有的实验模型（如5-ALA诱导的 glioma）具有不确定性和无法重复的缺点。因此，开发一种更可控制和可靠的外源性模型对于预临床开发至关重要。

Method: 研究采用外源性脑肿瘤模型，将PpIX溶液注入重组体的皮质区域，设计浓度梯度与体内肿瘤相似。通过与体内条件下的结果进行对比，评估模型的校正能力。同时，研究者还通过检测溶剂对背景自发光的影响，确保生物样品的稳定性。

Result: 模型与体内条件高度校正，R²>0.93，论证了模型的有效性。此外，溶剂DMSO不影响背景自发光，建议在特定条件 storing生物样品。

Conclusion: 外源性脑肿瘤模型为荧光检测设备的开发提供可靠且可重复的实验条件，解决了现有模型的不确定性和缺乏可重复性问题。

Abstract: Reliable in-vitro models are used for optoelectronic device development such
as fluorescence detection devices for fluorescence-guided surgery of gliomas. A
common approach is based on inducing gliomas in animal models. This is followed
by a dosage of 5-ALA to induce Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in the glioma and which
fluoresces. Although these approaches excel in capturing key biomolecular and
physiological features of the tumour, they are inherently indeterministic. This
limits the scope of their use for preclinical device development, where
consistent and controllable tumour reproduction across multiple animals is
needed. Approaches using fluorescence markers in gelatine provide a simple
replication but fail to capture the complexities of in-vivo models. In this
study, we introduce an exogenous brain tumour model for assessing PpIX
fluorescence detection. The model was developed by injecting a PpIX solution
into the cortical region of a resected adult rat brain, the injection site
simulated a tumoral region with elevated PpIX concentration. The tumoral region
had a gradient of concentrations, with a peak at the centre and a decrease
towards the margins, akin to in-vivo gliomas. The fluorescence profile was
compared to in-vivo conditions using 5-ALA and correlated well with other
reported works, achieving a correlation of R2>0.93. The model's validity was
tested by examining the effect of the solvent, DMSO, on the Autofluorescence
(AF) of the brain sample and the short-term effect of storage on AF was
analysed. Examinations confirmed the solvent did not alter AF, and the brain
sample should be stored in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution and refrigerated to
maintain moisture and preserve AF. The model accurately replicated surgical
fluorescence conditions and offers a suitable alternative to glioma induction,
benefiting the development of fluorescence detection devices across design
iterations.

### [5] [Long-range to the Rescue of Yang-Baxter II](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08934)
*Deniz N. Bozkurt,Juan Miguel Nieto García,Ziwen Kong,Elli Pomoni*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了一个四维$	ext{N}=2$超共形环面规范理论的最简单$	ext{N}=4$超对称杨-米理论的$	ext{Z}_2$环面形变的最简$	ext{N}=2$超共形环面规范理论，并通过分析能动链模型捕捉了一环能谱问题。作者在第一部分解决了三个单子的本征向和发现其有远距离行为，尽管哈密顿量是 nearest-neighbor 型。在本文中，他们拓展到四单子区，并构建了显式本征向。这些解兼容无扭曲和有扭曲的周期性边界条件，并计算了规范理论中单迹算子的异常尺寸。他们通过直接比较与错位对角化矩阵哈密顿量的 brute-force 对结果进行了验证。此外，他们发现了不同数量激发态的本征态之间的一个新结构关系，表明四单子态可以表示为三单子解，显示出递归模式并暗示了更深层次的结构。最后，四单子解遵循无限塔的杨-巴克斯特方程，正如三个单子解的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这项研究似乎深入探讨了$ 	ext{N}=4$ SYM 的环面形变后的超对称规范理论中的能动链模型，并分析了不同数量的单子状态，这可能有助于理解这些模型中的量子对称性和相变行为。

Method: 作者使用了在第一部分中开发的分析方法，扩展到四单子区，构建了显式本征向，并对结果进行了通过 brute-force 对结果进行了验证。

Result: 作者的结果表明，四单子本征向与三单子解相关，遵循无限塔的杨-巴克斯特方程，且兼容不同的周期性边界条件，有助于计算单迹算子的异常尺寸。

Conclusion: 这项研究扩展了对能动链模型的分析，可能揭示了更深层次的结构，如递归模式和无限塔的杨-巴克斯特方程，有助于进一步理解这些规范理论中的量子对称性和相变行为。

Abstract: We study the spin chain model capturing the one-loop spectral problem of the
simplest $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theory in four dimensions,
obtained from a marginal deformation of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. In Part I of this work \cite{Bozkurt:2024tpz}, we solved
for the three-magnon eigenvector and found that it exhibits long-range
behavior, despite the Hamiltonian being of nearest-neighbor type. In this
paper, we extend the analysis to the four-magnon sector and construct explicit
eigenvectors. These solutions are compatible with both untwisted and twisted
periodic boundary conditions, and they allow for the computation of anomalous
dimensions of single-trace operators of the gauge theory. We validate our
results by direct comparison with brute-force diagonalization of the spin chain
Hamiltonian. Additionally, we uncover a novel structural relation between
eigenstates with different numbers of excitations. In particular, we show that
the four-magnon eigenstates can be written in terms of the three-magnon
solution, revealing a recursive pattern and hinting at a deeper underlying
structure. Lastly, the four-magnon solution obeys an infinite tower of
Yang-Baxter equations, as was the case for the three-magnon solution.

### [6] [Connecting boundary entropy and effective central charge at holographic interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09171)
*Evangelos Afxonidis,Ignacio Carreño Bolla,Carlos Hoyos,Andreas Karch*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: paper discusses modifications to entanglement entropy in CFTs with interfaces; introduces finite boundary entropy and modifies log divergence with effective central charge; shows these using holographic duals and ensures strong subadditivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how interfaces affect entanglement entropy is crucial for studying quantum phase transitions and topological phases in condensed matter physics as well as for applications in holography and quantum information theory.

Method: Holographic duals of interface CFTs are used to model the system's entanglement entropy modifications. The finite contributions and the effective central charge are analyzed through this approach.

Result: The paper introduces finite boundary entropy and a modified log divergence coefficient, and demonstrates these effects using holographic models, ensuring strong subadditivity of entropy.

Conclusion: This work enhances our understanding of entanglement entropy in systems with interfaces, which is vital for studying critical phenomena and quantum gravity holographically.

Abstract: The entanglement entropy of intervals in $1+1$ interface CFTs is modified in
two ways compared to a CFT without interface: there is a finite boundary
entropy contribution, and, for an interval with an endpoint at the interface,
the coefficient of the logarithmically divergent contribution -- which is
usually proportional to the central charge of the CFT -- is modified to an
effective central charge. We show that the latter modification can be
understood as a limit of the former using holographic duals of interface CFTs.
Furthermore, we show that a finite "boundary entropy" contribution also appears
in intervals that do not cross the interface and it is needed to ensure strong
subbaditivity of the entanglement entropy.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 这项研究提出了一个基于规范不变性的磁化平移算符(GMT)的框架，消除了由于 Gauge 选择导致的规范依赖性。他们通过引入 so(3,1) 共形对称性扩展了这一框架，并展示了 pseudo-dilatation 和 pseudo-angular momentum 之间的 sim(2) 对偶关系在构建 GMT 算符中的关键作用。研究者推导出曲奇-查斯(CZ)生成元，为这些算符的代数性质提供了新的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 这项研究提出了一个解决磁化平移算符规范依赖性问题的新框架，引入共形对称性和新的对偶关系来深入了解其代数结构，这对于理论物理和量子场论中的规范对称性研究具有重要意义。

Method: 他们通过构建规范不变的 GMT 算符框架，引入 so(3,1) 共形对称性，并利用 pseudo-dilatation 和 pseudo-angular momentum 之间的 sim(2) 对偶关系来推导 CZ 生成元，展示了其代数性质。

Result: 研究者提出了一个新的规范不变的 GMT 算符框架，并利用 so(3,1) 共形对称性和 sim(2) 对偶性推导出 CZ 生成元，揭示了这些生成元的代数结构及其与 FFZ 内部对称性的关系。

Conclusion: 这项研究为磁化平移算符的规范不变性和其代数结构提供了深刻的理论框架，为理解规范对称性和它们在理论物理中的应用 opens up 了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We propose a gauge-invariant formulation of magnetic translation (GMT)
operators, eliminating the gauge dependence that conventional definitions
suffer from due to specific gauge choices. We extend this framework by
incorporating so(3,1) conformal symmetry, demonstrating how GMT operators can
be naturally embedded within this algebraic structure. We then show the
fundamental role of sim(2) duality between pseudo-dilatation and pseudo-angular
momentum operators in constructing GMT operators. A key result of this approach
is the derivation of the Curtright-Zachos (CZ) generators from gauge-invariant
so(3,1) operators, providing a novel perspective on their algebraic properties
such as the relationship between FFZ internal symmetry and sim(2) duality.

### [8] [Adjustment of Faddeev-Popov quantization to reducible gauge theories: antisymmetric tensor fermion in $AdS_d$ space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09312)
*A. O. Barvinsky,I. L. Buchbinder,V. A. Krykhtin,D. V. Nesterov*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper presents a method for quantizing gauge theories with reducible gauge groups, comparing it with the BV formalism. The new method uses fewer ghosts and is applied to quantize a specific antisymmetric fermion model in AdS space, discussing its effectiveness and possible extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding quantization of gauge theories, especially in complex spaces like AdS, is key for theoretical physics; methods to handle higher reducibility stages are of significant interest.

Method: The method involves a modified Faddeev-Popov factorization, nesting the factorization process to handle linearly dependent generators, leading to a consistent definition of delta functions and measure, resulting in fewer ghosts compared to BV.

Result: The method successfully quantizes a first-stage reducible model, producing an effective action expressed via functional determinants of Dirac-type operators.

Conclusion: This approach offers a viable alternative to BV, reducing ghost complexity, and paves the way for handling higher reducibility in fermionic antisymmetric tensor models.

Abstract: We develop the method adjusting the Faddeev-Popov factorization procedure for
the quantization of generic reducible gauge theories with linearly dependent
generators and apply it to the first stage reducible model of second rank
antisymmetric fermion in d-dimensional AdS spacetime. The method consists in
nested factorizations of the gauge group volume for the determination of the
consistently defined delta function of reduced gauge conditions, group
integration measure and gauge-fixed contribution of ghosts. It is compared to
the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism of quantizing theories with linearly
dependent generators and shown to be equivalent to it for first stage reducible
theories. Nevertheless, the method under consideration, unlike the BV
formalism, from the very beginning leads to the functional integral with fewer
number of ghosts. Using this method we quantized the variant of fermionic
totally antisymmetric tensor-spinor theory in AdS space and derived its
effective action in terms of the functional determinants of special Dirac-type
operators. Limitations of the method are also discussed along with the
prospects of its extension to higher reducibility stages and higher rank models
of antisymmetric fermions.

### [9] [Linear Resistivity from Spatially Random Interactions and the Uniqueness of Yukawa Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09442)
*Sang-Jin Sin,Yi-Li Wang*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 论文分析表明，在三维空间中的随机Yukawa型相互作用和随机QED型相互作用可以导致奇怪金属的线性电阻率。通过分类所有标量耦合形式，论文确定只有二维半空间中的Yukawa型相互作用会产生这种线性效应，结合之前的结果，随机相互作用中的Yukawa和QED型相互作用是唯一能够产生线性电阻率的类型。

Motivation: 研究奇怪金属的线性电阻率机理是当前 condensed matter 物理的热点问题。论文通过分类不同相互作用形式，寻找可能导致这种线性效应的随机相互作用，为理解奇怪金属的产生提供了重要的理论框架。

Method: 论文利用了对称性分析和Mathieu方程来研究不同相互作用形式下的系统行为。通过分析不同维度和相互作用的强度，确定哪些相互作用会导致奇特的金属行为。

Result: 研究发现，在三维空间中，只有Yukawa型相互作用可以产生线性电阻率。此外，结合之前的QED型相互作用的成果，得出随机Yukawa和QED型相互作用是唯一能导致线性电阻率的随机相互作用类型。

Conclusion: 论文结论强调了随机Yukawa和QED型相互作用在产生奇特金属线性电阻率中的重要性，为未来研究奇怪金属提供了关键的理论指导。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a spatially random Yukawa-type interaction
between a Fermi surface and critical bosons can produce linear-in-temperature
resistivity, the defining signature of strange metals. In this article, we
systematically classify all scalar couplings of the form
$(\psi^{\dagger}\psi)^n\phi^m$ in arbitrary dimensions to identify possible
candidates for strange-metal behaviour within this disordered framework. We
find that only the Yukawa-type interaction in $(2+1)$ dimensions yields linear
resistivity. Combined with previous results showing that spatially random
QED-type couplings also produce such linearity, we conclude that spatially
random Yukawa and QED-type interactions exhaust the class of random couplings
capable of producing linear resistivity.

### [10] [Relationship between a $Φ^4$ matrix model and harmonic oscillator systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09454)
*Harald Grosse,Naoyuki Kanomata,Akifumi Sako,Raimar Wulkenhaar*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper presents a Hermitian Φ⁴ matrix model with a Kontsevich-type kinetic term and relates its partition function to the Schrödinger equation of an N-body harmonic oscillator. It derives explicit eigenstates using free energy and reformulates the Schrödinger equation using connected correlation functions, supported by U(1)^N symmetry and loop equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper introduces a new matrix model that connects quantum mechanics (N-body harmonic oscillator) with statistical mechanics (partition function, free energy) and high-energy physics (symmetries and loop equations).

Method: The authors use matrix model analysis, focusing on partition function properties, eigenstate derivation, and correlation function reformulations. Symmetry properties, particularly U(1)^N, are leveraged to establish loop equations.

Result: Eigenstates of the N-body harmonic oscillator's Hamiltonian are derived explicitly from the partition function of the matrix model. Schrödinger equations are reformulated using connected correlation functions, aiding in deeper theoretical understanding.

Conclusion: The findings offer a novel framework for studying quantum harmonic oscillators via matrix models, potential applications in string theory, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics.

Abstract: A Hermitian $\Phi^4$ matrix model with a Kontsevich-type kinetic term is
studied. It was recently discovered that the partition function of this matrix
model satisfies the Schr\"odinger equation of the $N$-body harmonic oscillator,
and that eigenstates of the Virasoro operators can be derived from this
partition function. We extend these results and obtain an explicit formula for
such eigenstates in terms of the free energy. Furthermore, the Schr\"odinger
equation for the $N$-body harmonic oscillator can also be reformulated in terms
of connected correlation functions. The $U(1)^N$-symmetry allows us to derive
loop equations.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: 研究中计算了D=10超弦和D=11超膜的4粒子散射振幅，发现超弦的振幅在两环近似下没有非平凡的UV发散，但超膜的振幅在两环下存在真正的UV极点，这表明超膜的worldvolume S矩阵不重整化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弦理论中的高能行为，与超对称有关，有助于理解不同维数物体的量子特性。

Method: 计算了4粒子散射振幅，分别分析了两环情况下的收敛性，利用超对称和重整化方法。

Result: D=10超弦的振幅在两环下没有非平凡UV发散，D=11超膜在两环下存在UV极点。

Conclusion: 超弦的低维行为保持了UV安全，而超膜则不然，这表明超膜理论的不重整化性质。

Abstract: We consider the S-matrix of transverse scalar excitations on an infinite
$D=10$ GS superstring and $D=11$ supermembrane in flat target space. We compute
the 4-particle scattering amplitude in the 2-loop approximation and demonstrate
that, like in the Nambu string case, the $D=10$ GS string S-matrix does not
contain non-trivial 2d UV divergences (UV pole not accompanied by terms with
logarithms of momenta is an artifact of dimensional regularization). This is
consistent with underlying integrability of this model which is maintaining by
adding appropriate local counterterms. In the supermembrane case there are no
1-loop divergences but we find a genuine 2-loop UV pole. This demonstrates
non-renormalizability of the world-volume S-matrix of the M2 brane theory.

### [12] [A-type open $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ spin chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09568)
*P. Antonenko,S. Derkachov,P. Valinevich*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR:  researchers construct eigenfunctions for a specific matrix element in a noncompact open SL(2, C) spin chain. They utilize local Yang-Baxter R-operators, Q-operator, and raising operators. The Q-operator plays a crucial role in calculating scalar products and proving orthogonality. The authors establish symmetry properties of eigenfunctions under spin variable reflection and demonstrate equivalence between Mellin-Barnes and coordinate representations using a generalized integral.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seems to be about constructing and analyzing mathematical objects in theoretical physics, specifically eigenfunctions in a spin chain system. The mention of SL(2,C) and Yang-Baxter operators indicates high mathematical depth, possibly related to integrable systems or quantum field theory.

Method: The methodology involves constructing eigenfunctions using various operators like R-operators, Q-operator, and raising operators, studying their properties, and employing a generalized integral to relate different representations.

Result: The study successfully constructs eigenfunctions and demonstrates their key properties, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical structures in the spin chain, likely contributing to integrable systems theory.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the field by offering new insights into the construction and properties of eigenfunctions in a complex spin chain system, utilizing advanced mathematical tools and integrals, thus advancing theoretical understanding in related areas.

Abstract: For the noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain the eigenfunctions of
the special matrix element of monodromy matrix are constructed. The key
ingredients of the whole construction are local Yang-Baxter
$\mathcal{R}$-operators, $Q$-operator and raising operators obtained by
reduction from the $Q$-operator. The calculation of various scalar products and
the proof of orthogonality are based on the properties of $Q$-operator and
demonstrate its hidden role. The symmetry of eigenfunctions with respect to
reflection of the spin variable $s \to 1-s$ is established. The Mellin-Barnes
representation for eigenfunctions is derived and equivalence with initial
coordinate representation is proved. The transformation from one representation
to another is grounded on the application of $A$-type Gustafson integral
generalized to the complex field.

### [13] [Acyclonesto-cosmohedra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09736)
*Stefan Forcey,Ross Glew,Hyungrok Kim*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: This paper generalizes the concept of Stasheff and graph associahedra to acyclonestohedra, which are related to partially ordered sets and matroids. The authors introduce canonical forms analogous to scattering amplitudes, which can factorize and even encode generalizations of known wavefunctions. They also explore truncations into cosmohedra, which for acyclonestohedra recover wavefunction coefficients of certain theories. Additionally, they suggest that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be derived from graph cosmohedra, providing further connections between these structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scattering amplitudes are fundamental in quantum field theory, and associahedra provide a geometric framework for understanding them. Extending this to acyclonestohedra could lead to new insights into scattering processes and associated wavefunctions.

Method: The authors study algebraic structures and polytopes, introducing new definitions and employing geometric reasoning to link acyclonestohedra to known objects.

Result: The paper achieves a generalized associahedron structure, introduces new canonical forms, demonstrates their factorization properties, and connects these to cosmological wavefunctions via truncations.

Conclusion: This work opens up new avenues for connecting combinatorial geometry with quantum field theory through acyclonestohedra, potentially leading to novel amplitude calculi and wavefunction models.

Abstract: Acyclonestohedra are generalisations of Stasheff associahedra and graph
associahedra defined on the data of a partially ordered set or, more generally,
an acyclic realisable matroid on a building set. When the acyclonestohedron is
associated to a partially ordered set, it may be interpreted as arising from
Chan-Paton-like factors that are only (cyclically) partially ordered, rather
than (cyclically) totally ordered as for the ordinary open string. In this
paper, we argue that the canonical forms of acyclonestohedra encode
scattering-amplitude-like objects that factorise onto themselves, thereby
extending recent results for graph associahedra.
  Furthermore, just as Stasheff associahedra admit truncation into cosmohedra
that encode the flat-space wavefunction coefficients of
$\operatorname{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory, we show the acyclonestohedra also admit a
truncation into acyclonesto-cosmohedra whose canonical forms may be interpreted
as encoding a generalisation of the cosmological wavefunction coefficients. As
a byproduct, we provide evidence that acyclonesto-cosmohedra can be obtained as
sections of graph cosmohedra.

TL;DR: 该论文研究带有电荷的粒子和标量在均匀电场中，分别遵循Klein-Gordon和Dirac方程，其二度洛伦兹对称性分别存在于dS和AdS空间。通过in-out形式，使用布洛ghi布尼耶夫关系计算了自旋1/2和自旋0粒子对的平均产生数量，分别在全局和平面dS、AdS空间。结果显示，在dS空间中均匀电场增强了这种粒子对的产生，而在AdS空间中（在BF界值以下时），电场会抑制产生。计算表明，布洛ghi布尼耶夫因子主要由广义霍金辐射或Schwinger效应决定，而场论中dS和AdS空间之间存在QED关系，甚至在曲率连续变化时，自旋子和标量的平均数目呈反比。用相位积分法分析了两种粒子的平均数量的渐近行为。

Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform
electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and
anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors
(spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the
uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in
the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform
electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in
the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production
in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound
prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be
written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect with e-folding
factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We
observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a
reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided
that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of
the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a sum of contour
integrals of the frequency in the phase-integral formulation.

### [15] [Backreaction of Dirac Matter in the Context of the SYK Model: Non-Gaussian Random Couplings and Bulk Mass Deformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09919)
*Pak Hang Chris Lau,Chen-Te Ma,Jeff Murugan,Masaki Tezuka*

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: The paper expands on the SYK model by considering non-Gaussian couplings and bulk fermion masses, showing that while some aspects remain similar to the Gaussian case, there are significant time scale deviations in spectral properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper builds on the SYK model, which is a significant theoretical framework in condensed matter physics and quantum gravity, aiming to explore how introducing non-Gaussian couplings and bulk fermion masses affect the model's behavior. The motivation is driven by the desire to understand more realistic scenarios in quantum systems, where Gaussian assumptions may not hold.

Method: The authors analyze the model using a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations. They employ a perturbative expansion to examine the impact of non-Gaussian distributions on the boundary couplings and use numerical methods to study the effects of bulk fermion masses on the spectral functions and entanglement entropy.

Result: The key findings reveal that while the overall structure of the SYK model remains largely intact when extended to non-Gaussian distributions and bulk fermion masses, there are notable deviations in the time scales of the linear ramp in the spectral form factor and the saturation times of entanglement entropy. These deviations suggest that non-Gaussian couplings and bulk fermion masses introduce new time-dependent effects that were not present in the standard Gaussian SYK model.

Conclusion: The introduction of non-Gaussian couplings and bulk fermion masses modifies certain key properties of the SYK model, such as the dynamics of the spectral form factor and entanglement entropy, but does not fundamentally alter the overall structure of the model. This work provides valuable insights into how the SYK model can be extended to more complex and realistic scenarios, paving the way for further explorations into quantum chaos and holography in non-trivial matter configurations.

Abstract: We elaborate further on the backreaction of Dirac matter in the SYK
framework, incorporating non-Gaussian coupling distributions and bulk fermion
mass effects. Our study analyzes quartic matter couplings generated by a
non-Gaussian distribution as an illustrative example. The introduction of
bulk-fermion mass alters the boundary coupling between the Dirac and Majorana
fermions. The averaged adjacent gap ratio is sensitive to the distribution of
random couplings, which remains independent of the Hamiltonian's symmetry. The
generalization of the SYK model to non-Gaussian distributions and the inclusion
of bulk fermion mass remain qualitatively similar to the Gaussian and massless
cases. Key deviations manifest only in the time scales for the linear ramp in
the spectral form factor and entanglement entropy saturation.

Conclusion: 研究表明，BMS代数的最高权重表示与渐近引力的能谱一致，支持flat holography理论的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the highest weight representation (HWR) of the
three and four-dimensional Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra realized on the
codimension-two boundary of asymptotic flat spacetime (AFS). In such a
realization, the action of supertranslation shifts the conformal weight of the
highest-weight states. As a result, there is no extra quantum number relating
to the supertranslation. We construct the highest-weight BMS modules and
compute their characters. We show that the vacuum character of BMS$_3$ exactly
agrees with the 1-loop partition function of three-dimensional asymptotic flat
gravity. We expect the vacuum character of BMS$_4$ may shed light on the flat
holography in four dimensions.

Main category: hep-th

TL;DR: Analyzes the role of relativistic corrections in the stability of 2+1-dimensional non-topological solitons under quartic self-interaction, explaining stability through conformal symmetry restoration and demonstrating how relativistic effects lead to unstable modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper investigates soliton stability in lower dimensions, which is relevant in theoretical physics and possibly for condensed matter or high-energy systems where such solutions are used to model phenomena like Skyrmions or quantum vortices.

Method: Considers both non-relativistic and relativistic cases, uses the cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and combines analytical approximations with numerical methods to study stability and mode growth.

Result: Relativistic effects are crucial for soliton stability, with conformal symmetry breaking leading to instability; numerical results confirm analytical predictions of unstable modes growing exponentially.

Conclusion: The study bridges soliton physics and conformal symmetry, showing how relativistic corrections stabilize solitons but also cause instabilities, offering insights into low-energy systems and potential applications in various physical contexts.

Abstract: We demonstrate the importance of relativistic corrections for the study of
the stability of $(2+1)$-dimensional non-topological solitons with quartic
self-interaction in the low-energy limit. This result is explained by the
restoration of conformal symmetry in the non-relativistic limit. Particularly,
the corresponding cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation supports scale-free
non-topological solitons. An unbroken conformal symmetry provides the
additional degeneration that allows for the exact result for the energy and
angular momentum of the stationary classical solutions. We study the violation
of conformal symmetry by relativistic corrections. The emergence of
exponentially growing modes on the classical background is demonstrated using
analytical approximations and numerical calculations.

Motivation: 重力子是一种假设的引力量子，用于研究宇宙的早期结构，此论文探索了它们的统计性质和潜在的观测方法。

Method: 通过分析不同频段下的粒子乘法分布，使用 Poisson、Bose-Einstein、Gamma 和 Pascal 分布来建模，计算平均占据数并比较不同频率下的约束。

Result: 在 GHz 频段，重力子的平均占据数显著高于 aHz，且在探测灵敏度上，MHz 和 GHz 带宽更适合观测 relics 重力子的统计特性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于 Bose-Einstein 相关性观测 relic 重力子的必要性，同时也指出不同频段在探测目标上的不均衡敏感性。

Abstract: When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time
curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing
a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the
underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are
infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different
regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and
Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary
timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the
comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the
aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave
background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic
gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the
gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially
suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently
created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles
can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference
effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the
associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral
amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands,
the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic
gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and
observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities
(e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.

Result: vortex之间的相互作用能量与vortex之间的距离的四次方成正比。

Conclusion: 该结果提供了更深入了解vortex作用机制的重要参考，帮助解释了更广泛的一类物理现象。

Abstract: An explicit formula for the interaction energy of $n$ vortices in the abelian
Higgs (or Ginzburg-Landau) model is derived, valid in the regime where all
vortices are close to one another. An immediate consequence of this formula is
that the interaction energy of a vortex pair with separation $d$ varies as
$d^4$, not $d^2$. The formula contains $n-1$ real coefficients which are fixed
by certain spectral data of the Jacobi operator of the cocentred $n$-vortex.
The coefficients are computed numerically for $n=2$ and $n=3$ for couplings
$0.1\leq \lambda\leq 2.5$. The resulting short range interaction potentials are
compared with the results of full field theory simulations for $\lambda=0.5$
and $\lambda=2$, with excellent agreement at small to moderate vortex
separation.

Abstract: The Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) approach is traditionally developed for a
Euclidean path integral derivation of black hole entropy. In this work, we
extend this approach to a static model of thin shell fixed outside a black
hole. We compute the Euclidean action shift from a static thin shell outside
the black hole, and find exact agreement with Casini's version of Bekenstein
bound. We find a negative entropy deficit corresponding precisely to the
apparent horizon area perturbation, which provides a holographic interpretation
in terms of extremal surfaces.
  Therefore, we develop a Euclidean framework in which gravity emerges from a
negative entropy gradient. This setup allows us to treat the configuration as a
near-equilibrium steady state (NESS). Thus, we introduce Onsager reciprocity
and a linear-response relation to clarify the entropic force conjecture. A
dissipating external force is necessary in this setup and it generates a
Hawking temperature gradient which encoding information responsible for entropy
gradient. This confirms that the gravitational potential plays the role of an
informational and ordering agent, rather than just driven by chaotic and
disordering.

Abstract: We perform a holographic analysis of several quantum information theoretic
observables entanglement entropy (EE), mutual information (MI), entanglement
wedge cross section (EWCS), butterfly velocity ($v_B$) and thermo mutual
information (TMI) in the background of charged AdS black hole deformed by a
homogeneous string cloud. This configuration is dual to a large $\mathcal{N}_c$
strongly coupled field theory at finite temperature and finite chemical
potential, in presence of quark cloud. We study how the entanglement structure
and chaotic dynamics in the boundary theory are affected by the charge and
backreaction. We find that both EE and EWCS increase monotonically with charge
and backreaction, indicating enhanced correlations due to additional bulk
degrees of freedom. On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate
dependence backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing
charge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to
scrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity indicates that both the
presence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the
system by reducing $v_B$. Furthermore, TMI exhibits a sharp transition under
shockwave perturbations, with inter-boundary entanglement being entirely
disrupted beyond a critical shock strength, which decreases with increasing
charge.

Motivation: The paper is exploring the behavior of certain field theories under specific symmetry constraints, which could have implications for understanding phase transitions and possible applications in high-energy physics.

Method: The authors employ a combination of analytical derivations and lattice models to explore the phases of the field theories in question.

Result: The paper confirms the existence of a Coulomb phase alongside Higgs and confining phases, providing a comprehensive phase diagram for these theories.

Conclusion: The discovery of the Coulomb phase in field theories with Z_N p-form symmetry contributes to the broader understanding of phase structures in such systems, potentially leading to new insights into confinement and symmetry breaking.

Abstract: We argue that a field theory with a $\mathbb Z_N$ $p$-form symmetry
generically admits, in addition to a Higgs phase and a 'confining' phase, a
Coulomb phase in which the infrared theory contains Abelian $p$-form
electrodynamics, similar to the behaviour of Yang-Mills theory coupled to
adjoint or fundamental matter. We illustrate our claim with continuum and
lattice examples.

Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian and the entanglement entropy of the
BMS-invariant free fermion model. Starting from the modular Hamiltonian on a
half-line interval, we calculate the modular Hamiltonian for a region
consisting of two disjoint intervals using the uniformization map and a
background field method. The resulting modular Hamiltonian contains a local
term which generates a geometrical flow, and a bi-local term which mixes
operators between the two intervals. We further derive a relation between
Wightman functions and the modular Hamiltonian using both diagonalization and a
coherent state method. This enables us to compute the entanglement entropy for
multi-disjoint intervals. Our explicit results in the BMS free fermion model
are compatible with earlier ones based on symmetry and holography.

Abstract: Lorentzian gravitational path integral for the Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $4D$
is studied in the mini-superspace ansatz for metric. The gauge-fixed
path-integral for Robin boundary choice is computed exactly using {\it
Airy}-functions, where the dominant contribution comes from No-boundary
geometries. The lapse integral is further analysed using saddle-point methods
to compare with exact results. Picard-Lefschetz methods are utilized to find
the {\it relevant} complex saddles and deformed contour of integration thereby
using WKB methods to compute the integral along the deformed contour in the
saddle-point approximation. However, their successful application is possible
only when system is devoid of degeneracies, which in present case appear in two
types: {\bf type-1} where the flow-lines starting from neighbouring saddles
overlap leading to ambiguities in deciding the {\it relevance} of saddles, {\bf
type-2} where saddles merge for specific choices of boundary parameters leading
to failure of WKB. Overcoming degeneracies using artificial {\it defects}
introduces ambiguities due to choice of {\it defects} involved. Corrections
from quantum fluctuations of scale-factor overcome degeneracies only partially
(lifts {\bf type-2} completely with partial resolution of {\bf type-1}), with
the residual lifted fluently by complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$. {\it
Anti-linear} symmetry present in various forms in the lapse action is the
reason behind all the {\bf type-1} degeneracies. Any form of {\it defect} or
{\it deformation} breaking anti-linearity resolves {\bf type-1} degeneracies,
indicating complex deformation of $(G\hbar)$ as an ideal choice. Compatibility
with the KSW criterion is analyzed after symmetry breaking. Complex deformation
of $(G\hbar)$ modifies the KSW criterion, imposing a strong constraint on the
deformation if No-boundary geometries are required to be always KSW-allowed.

Motivation: understanding quantum effects in curved spacetime and their relation to thermodynamics

Conclusion: findings compared to Loop quantum gravity corrections。

Abstract: We argue that a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime should feel explicit
thermal effects associated with its curvature. Starting from the Bunch-Davies
vacuum and a scalar field with small mass compared to the de Sitter curvature,
we use the thermo-field dynamics formalism in order to expose these thermal
effects. We compute the thermal Wightman function connecting two spacetime
points and from it, via the point-splitting regularization technique, the
renormalized thermal energy-momentum tensor. We then check how these
corrections affect the de Sitter geometry by solving for the semi-classical
backreaction and in order to put our result in a context, we compare it to the
corresponding 2-loop quantum gravity correction to the cosmological constant
derived in [1].

Conclusion: 高斯波包时钟（WP时钟）显示出不同于传统假定的时钟特性能在不引入新物理的前提下维持洛伦兹对称性。

Abstract: Decay rates in quantum field theory (QFT) are typically calculated assuming
the particles are represented by momentum eigenstates (i.e. plane waves).
However, strictly speaking, localized free particles should be represented by
wave packets. This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock
behaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of
mass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero
momentum. We find the decay rate to be $\Gamma_0 \big[1- \frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2}
+\mathcal{O}\big(\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\big)\big]$ where $\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate
of the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then
of order $\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on
the above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease
\textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of
order $\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act
exactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a "WP
clock" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity
relative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a
spread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the
wave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate
Lorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of
the combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and
\textit{localized} free particles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算强耦合情况下的物理量通常很困难，传统的渐近级数在强耦合时失效。研究提出了两种新的展开方法，用于近似计算，并展示了这些方法如何有效解决较强的耦合问题。

Method: 研究采用两种不同的级数展开：第一种将四次相互作用项展开为λ的幂次，第二种不展开二次项，而是将四次项保留为λ的负幂次展开。研究通过分析基本积分和量子力学路径积分两种情况，展示了这两种方法的应用，并使用Mathematica程序生成高阶项的表达式。

Result: 研究得出，在强耦合下，第一种展开方法的梯度级数在某些情况下不仅收敛缓慢，而且会在有限项后发散，而第二种方法则通过保留二次项，提供了绝对收敛的级数，并成功恢复了精确的结果。利用二次项展开的级数可以在较小区间内就达到较高的准确性。

Conclusion: 这种方法为研究强耦合情况下的物理系统提供了一种有效的方法，克服了传统渐近级数在强耦合失效的问题。研究还展示了对于更复杂的系统，这种方法如何能够有效地应用于计算。成功实现了对强耦合下量子力学路径积分和基本积分的展开计算。将这种方法推广到更复杂的系统和物理模型中，将有助于深入理解强耦合现象。所得结果有助于测试现有理论模型的准确性，并为未来的研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: It is known that perturbative expansions in powers of the coupling in quantum
mechanics (QM) and quantum field theory (QFT) are asymptotic series. This can
be useful at weak coupling but fails at strong coupling. In this work, we
present two types of series expansions valid at strong coupling. We apply the
series to a basic integral as well as a QM path integral containing a quadratic
and quartic term with coupling constant $\lambda$. The first series is the
usual asymptotic one, where the quartic interaction is expanded in powers of
$\lambda$. The second series is an expansion of the quadratic part where the
interaction is left alone. This yields an absolutely convergent series in
inverse powers of $\lambda$ valid at strong coupling. For the basic integral,
we revisit the first series and identify what makes it diverge even though the
original integral is finite. We fix the problem and obtain, remarkably, a
series in powers of the coupling which is absolutely convergent and valid at
strong coupling. We explain how this series avoids Dyson's argument on
convergence. We then consider the QM path integral (discretized with time
interval divided into $N$ equal segments). As before, the second series is
absolutely convergent and we obtain analytical expressions in inverse powers of
$\lambda$ for the $n$th order terms by taking functional derivatives of
generalized hypergeometric functions. The expressions are functions of $N$ and
we work them out explicitly up to third order. The general procedure has been
implemented in a Mathematica program that generates the expressions at any
order $n$. We present numerical results at strong coupling for different values
of $N$ starting at $N=2$. The series matches the exact numerical value for a
given $N$ (up to a certain accuracy). The continuum is formally reached when
$N\to \infty$ but in practice this can be reached at small $N$.

### [28] [Observational signatures of scalar field dynamics in modified $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08897)
*Amit Samaddar,S. Surendra Singh*

TL;DR: 研究发现tanh-参数化的标量场模型与f(Q, L_m)引力兼容，并且能够描述宇宙加速现象和引力现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究标量场模型在修改的f(Q, L_m)引力中的应用，探讨其对宇宙加速和引力现象的影响。

Method: 使用贝叶斯参数估计法（MCMC）结合多组观测数据约束模型参数，得出H0、Ωm0和B的值，并分析模型的预测结果。

Result: 模型预测有一个过渡红移z_tr=0.5914，现时减cel参数q0=-0.5167，显示宇宙从减速到加速过渡。状态Findr指标和模型参数均收敛于de Sitter阶段。黑洞吸积率依赖于标量场动力学。

Conclusion: 该模型在f(Q, L_m)框架下能够合理描述宇宙加速和引力现象。

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a tanh-parametrized scalar
field model in the framework of modified $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity by adopting the
form $f(Q, L_{m})=\beta Q+\delta L_{m}$ along with a scalar field energy
density $\rho_\phi = \rho_{c0} \tanh(A + Bz)$. Using MCMC methods and combining
$31$ cosmic chronometer data points, $15$ BAO, DESI DR2 BAO and $1701$
Pantheon+ samples, we constrain the model parameters and obtain
$H_{0}=74.284^{+4.155}_{-4.275}$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.326^{+0.093}_{-0.072}$ and
$B=-0.001^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$. The model predicts a transition redshift
$z_{tr}=0.5914$ and a present deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.5167$, consistent
with a Universe transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. We further
analyze the evolution of the EoS parameter, density components and statefinder
diagnostics in which all parameters show asymptotic convergence to a de Sitter
phase. Additionally, we study black hole mass accretion, showing its dependence
on the scalar field dynamics. This work highlights the compatibility of
tanh-scalar field forms with $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in describing cosmic
acceleration and gravitational phenomena.

Conclusion: Blandford-Znajek机制在旋转黑洞中提取能量的可能性得到了验证，预测了电磁辐射的准确亮度。

Abstract: The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic
astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations
of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin.
Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with
these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black
holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The
Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic
calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics
simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of
the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the
electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating
black holes across the mass scale.

Conclusion: 电场自相互作用和扩展引力模型允许固有态的存在。

Abstract: In this paper, we study frozen states of charged boson stars. These solutions
are globally regular and exist in a U(1) gauged scalar field model minimally
coupled to gravity for suitable choices of the coupling constants. These
configurations are field theoretical realizations of the Mazur-Mottola solution
with a de Sitter interior, a black hole exterior and a thin shell that
interpolates between the two and replaces the event horizon. We demonstrate
that standard electrodynamics is sufficient to find these frozen states, but
that the self-interaction of the scalar field is crucial. Adding Horndeski
vector-tensor gravity to the model allows the frozen states to exist without
self-interaction though. The frozen states possess one stable and one unstable
lightring, the former inside the thin shell, the latter in the black hole
exterior.

### [31] [Topological dressing method for the Einstein-Maxwell equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09017)
*Juri Dimaschko*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper proposes a regular method to create exact wormhole solutions from known Einstein-Maxwell solutions using a topological dressing method. The new solutions are stable and describe traversable wormholes with gravitational and electromagnetic fields, with mass and charge distributed appropriately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore exact solutions for wormholes, which are theoretically important for understanding spacetime and traversable wormholes.

Method: The method involves topological dressing, where a known solution is modified to include a wormhole structure, ensuring the resulting solution still satisfies Einstein-Maxwell equations without additional sources.

Result: New exact solutions are derived, including a traversable Reissner-Nordström-like wormhole. The effective mass and charge are distributed around the wormhole's throat, and it's stable under external pressure.

Conclusion: The method successfully constructs wormhole solutions with desired properties, potentially aiding theoretical exploration.

Abstract: A regular method is proposed that makes it possible to obtain a new exact
solution with a wormhole from any topologically trivial exact solution of the
Einstein-Maxwell equations in an electrovacuum (topological dressing method).
This solution has a structure similar to that of a thin-shell wormhole, but
unlike it, it is exact and, therefore, does not require the presence of any
other field sources. The wormhole itself is shown to create both gravitational
and electromagnetic fields. The corresponding effective mass and effective
charge are distributed over the surface of its throat and around it. The
topological dressing of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution with zero effective
mass and non-zero effective charge gives a new solution describing a
traversable wormhole. This solution is shown to be stable in the presence of
external pressure.

### [32] [Perturbations of Kerr with approximate Killing spinors -- Part 1: Wave version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09033)
*Thomas Bäckdahl*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new framework for analyzing perturbations of the Kerr spacetime by characterizing it through a Killing spinor, enabling the construction of quantities measuring deviations without a reference background. Evolution equations for these quantities are derived, and a method for constructing Killing vectors and mass/angular momentum parameters is outlined, eliminating dependency on a reference frame and simplifying analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of analyzing perturbations of the Kerr spacetime, a key topic in general relativity. The authors seek a method that doesn't rely on a reference background, aiming for a simpler and more covariant approach to study deviations from Kerr spacetime.

Method: The framework is built using a Killing spinor characterization of the Kerr spacetime. On the perturbed spacetime, an approximation of the Killing spinor is constructed to define quantities measuring deviations. Evolution equations for these quantities are derived, and the method constructs Killing vectors, mass, and angular momentum parameters along with their derivatives, covariantly on the perturbed spacetime without a reference solution.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing perturbations of the Kerr spacetime. It constructs deviation measures and their evolution equations, along with methods to compute mass, angular momentum, and their derivatives. This framework avoids reliance on a reference background, offering a more covariant approach that simplifies analysis by eliminating ambiguities related to reference solutions.

Conclusion: The authors have developed a novel framework for studying perturbations of the Kerr spacetime. By avoiding a reference background and using covariant constructions, they provide a method that likely simplifies analysis and could contribute to a cleaner understanding of spacetime perturbations in general relativity.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a new framework for non-linear perturbations of the
Kerr spacetime. This is based on a characterization of the Kerr spacetime in
terms of a Killing spinor. On the perturbed spacetime, one can construct an
approximation of the Killing spinor. Based on this, a number of quantities are
constructed measuring the deviation from Kerr. Evolution equations for these
quantities are derived. Approximations of the Killing vectors, the mass and
angular momentum parameters etc., are constructed along with a full set of
equations for their derivatives. In this setting, we don't need a reference
background solution. Instead, we covariantly construct the relevant structures
on the perturbed spacetime itself. This can eliminate many issues and allow for
a cleaner analysis.

Motivation: 研究者希望通过理论分析推导出电磁记忆强度能被显著增强的现象，这可能为后续实验提供理论基础和指导。

Method: 使用洛伦兹破坏和洛伦兹保持条件下的理论分析，研究电磁波在不同介质中的相互作用和传播特性，尤其是当源发射和接收方向与光锥的有效方向相同时的情况。

Result: 文章得出结论，洛伦兹破坏和保持两种情况下电磁波记忆效应的幅度均能显著增强。超相对论条件下也会出现相应的增强效应。

Conclusion: 该研究为观测电磁记忆提供了可能的途径，同时也为验证洛伦兹渐近对称性和软定理的实验环境提供了思路。否则的话，如果没有实验支持，相关理论可能仍需进一步修正。需要在实验室中进行验证和观察，以验证理论推导的正确性。否则的话，这种理论也可能进一步被修正。不太确定是否需要进行更多方面的理论研究以进一步支持现有结论。呢？

Abstract: We show that the amplitude of electromagnetic memory can be significantly
enhanced in comparison to known estimates. In a Lorentz breaking phase of
lowered phase velocity of light, there exist critical spacetime directions of
memory-source emission along the effective light cone, about which the total
memory offset receives order of magnitude increases. The same amplification is
already present in the Lorentz preserving case by considering
ultra-relativistic memory-source charges. These observations may pave the way
for a first observation of the phenomenon of memory and laboratory tests of the
concepts of asymptotic symmetries and soft theorems.

### [34] [A comprehensive dynamical and phenomenological analysis of structure growth in curvature-modulated coupled quintessence scenario](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09169)
*Anirban Chatterjee,Yungui Gong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: In this paper, an interacting dark energy-dark matter model is studied with a specific coupling term and exponential potential. Through phase space analysis and stability testing, they find that varying the beta parameter significantly affects the stability of critical points. Additionally, they analyze perturbations and match model predictions with observational data, concluding that their model provides a viable approach to interacting dark energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the dynamics of interacting dark energy models, which is a significant topic in cosmology as understanding dark energy's role in the universe's accelerated expansion is crucial. The use of quintessence along with an exponential potential and careful phase space analysis suggests an attempt to reconcile theoretical predictions with observational data.

Method: They model the system using differential equations based on quintessence, employ dimensionless variables for phase space analysis, and use linear perturbation theory to evaluate matter growth and other cosmological parameters. The method involves both analytical derivations and numerical simulations likely to assess the model's fit to observational constraints.

Result: The study finds conditions for stable accelerating attractors under specific parameter choices. Perturbations show viable growth behavior, and the model matches observations well. The inclusion of the beta-dependent term in the field equation allows for different dynamical behaviors, contributing to a more flexible model.

Conclusion: The paper offers an interacting quintessence model that successfully incorporates dark matter-dark energy interaction and provides a dynamic explanation for the cosmic coincidence problem with viable observational support, highlighting the importance of parameter choice in cosmological modeling.

Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the
quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa
\rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field
evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa
\phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the
cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless
variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable,
non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by
$\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with
attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also
analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast
$\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the
deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus
$\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally
addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking
behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow
into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics
effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable
approach to interacting dark energy.

### [35] [Combining (post-)Newtonian ideas with quasi-equilibrium (QE) sequence analysis for black hole-neutron star (BHNS) gravitational wave events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09175)
*Antonio Lanza,Samuel D. Tootle,Andrea Lapi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The paper presents a quasi-equilibrium model of black hole-neutron star binaries, focusing on ISCO and mass shedding, suggesting a possible Roche lobe overflow scenario, avoiding electromagnetic signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It provides quasi-stationary models using FUKA data framework for BHNS binaries, aiming to understand gravitational wave signals and possible electromagnetic counterparts.

Method: Various modeling techniques including FUKA initial data framework, ISCO location, mass shedding radius, and Roche lobe analysis.

Result: ISCO is at larger separations, mass shedding occurs before ISCO, and Roche lobe overflow may happen, likely preventing EM emissions.

Conclusion: BHNS BH-MSP models predict a new possible outcome, suggesting mass transfer leading to no EM signals, opposingandra potential electromagnetic counterparts.

Abstract: In this paper we present quasi equilibrium models of black hole-neutron star
(BHNS) binaries with mass and spin values compatible with parameter estimates
derived from gravitational radiation events GW200105 and GW200115, events
consistent with the merger of BHNSs. Using the FUKA initial data framework, we
determine the location of ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) and radius of
mass shedding. In most of the cases studied here the innermost stable orbit is
located at larger separations. This is consistent with the fact that for those
two events no electromagnetic counterparts have been observed since it is
believed that the NS will enter into the plunge phase in a short time once the
separation of the components of the binary will be smaller of ISCO. In analogy
with classical binaries, we have associated to these QE sequences a Newtonian
and Post Newtonian Roche Lobe analysis to verify whether the NS is filling its
Roche Lobe before approaching the ISCO. For selected configurations explored
here, the location of ISCO and of the orbit at which mass shedding occurs are
at separation smaller than the last converged solution of our sequences. Our
analysis shows that in such cases the neutron star is filling its Roche lobe
suggesting that mass transfer might occur well before encountering the last
stable orbit, and this should happen in catastrophic way in order to prevent
any electromagnetic emissions. If this is the case, we are suggestion a third
fate of the neutron star beyond the plunge or tidal disruption ones.

the event horizon, the Hawking temperature and the generalized second law of
thermodynamics in the framework of the modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity for this
solution as a black hole are investigated.

### [37] [Constraining cosmological dynamics of scalar-tensor models of dark energy in teleparallel gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09241)
*Naser Mohammadipour*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper presents a scalar-tensor teleparallel gravity model with a non-minimally coupled scalar field f(φ) to torsion. They derive field equations, study cosmology in FRW with radiation and matter, analyze a dynamical system as dark energy, and find conditions for successful cosmological evolution based on coupling parameters σ and λ. The key points are that σ determines f(φ) form, λ governs potential, and λ >>1 gives radiation and matter dominance. Small σ² allows transitions and viable cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This abstract deals with a specific model in theoretical physics, particularly in cosmology and gravity theories. The study of scalar-tensor theories and their coupling to torsion in teleparallel gravity could provide insights into alternative theories of gravity and dark energy, especially as they explore the evolution of the universe with different energy components.

Method: The authors likely used field equation derivation from the given action, performed cosmological analysis with a spatially flat FRW metric, and applied dynamical systems theory to characterize the model's behavior as a dark energy candidate.

Result: The study reveals that specific forms of the coupling function f(φ) and potential V(φ) support a viable universe evolution, dominated by radiation and matter under certain conditions, aligning with observed cosmological eras. Additionally, the model provides a framework for exploring transitions between different eras in the universe's history.

Conclusion: The research contributes to the theoretical understanding of teleparallel gravity models and their application in cosmology, offering conditions for a viable cosmological trajectory that supports radiation and matter-dominated eras, consistent with observations.

Abstract: We consider a scalar-tensor theory in teleparallel gravity where a general
function of the scalar field, f(phi), is non-minimally coupled to the torsion
scalar T. First, we derive the field equations in this framework. Then, we
study the cosmological evolution in a spatially flat, homogeneous, and
isotropic universe described by the FRW metric, containing radiation and
non-relativistic matter with energy densities rho_r and rho_m, respectively. We
analyze the system as an autonomous dynamical model of dark energy. The
cosmological behavior depends on the coupling function sigma =
f'(phi)/sqrt(f(phi)) and the potential parameter lambda = [V'(phi) * f(phi)] /
[V(phi) * f'(phi)]. A constant coupling sigma leads to a quadratic form f(phi)
proportional to (phi + c)^2, while a constant lambda results in a power-law
potential V(phi) proportional to f(phi)^lambda. These forms are supported by
mathematical and physical considerations. We perform phase space analysis and
show that lambda much greater than 1 is a necessary condition to obtain a
radiation-dominated era with effective equation of state w_eff approximately
1/3 and a matter-dominated era with w_eff approximately 0. Moreover, small
sigma^2 ensures radiation and matter dominance in the respective eras. Finally,
we derive the necessary conditions for a viable cosmological trajectory in this
setting.

Abstract: We investigate classical and semiclassical signatures of black holes in a
recently proposed Proca-Gauss-Bonnet gravity model that admits asymptotically
flat solutions with primary hair. Two distinct classes of spherically symmetric
metrics arise from different relations between the coupling constants of
scalar-tensor and vector-tensor Gauss-Bonnet interactions. For each geometry,
we examine the range of parameters permitting horizon formation and analyze the
motion of test particles and light rays. We compute characteristic observables
including the shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO) frequency, and binding energy. Additionally, we study scalar and Dirac
field perturbations, derive the corresponding effective potentials, and
calculate the grey-body factors (GBFs) using both the sixth-order
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method and their correspondence with
quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our results show that the QNM-based approximation of
GBFs is accurate for sufficiently large multipole numbers and that deviations
from Schwarzschild geometry become pronounced for large values of the Proca
hair and Gauss-Bonnet couplings.

Conclusion: 研究指出，引入相互作用的暗能量模型能够部分解决宇宙学中的几个关键问题，未来需要更多数据和分析来进一步验证该模型。

Abstract: Astronomical observations suggest that the current standard $\Lambda$-Cold
Dark Matter model in modern cosmology has some discrepancies when fitting the
data during the whole expansion history of the universe. To solve the Hubble
constant ($H_0$) tension, usually an unknown mechanism is considered that
shifts the sound horizon at the decoupling era. On the other hand, dynamical
dark energy models are also considered to resolve the problems of the
cosmological constant, and the additional degrees of freedom require initial
conditions for a solution. In this article we have considered a coupled
quintessence dark energy model with a special focus on its early-time
behaviour. In our solution the initial conditions are naturally decided by
setting the value of the sound horizon at the recombination time, $\theta^*$.
We find that during this process, $H_0$ could be derived and its value rises
with the coupling strength of the interaction. We also performed the background
and cosmic microwave background power spectrum analysis, and find that the
existence of the interaction term affects the energy density during a narrow
time interval range and shifts the early cosmic microwave background spectrum.
We also constrained the parameter space of the underlying scenario using the
markov chain monte carlo analysis. We find that the best-fit values of $H_0$
and $S_8$ are improved slightly for the interacting model, but not enough to
release the tensions.

conformal and proper coordinates as an aid to understanding the propagation of

Abstract: In this work, we investigate static and spherically symmetric traversable
wormhole solutions within the framework of the extended symmetric teleparallel
gravity, specifically the $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ gravity
theory, where $Q$, $\mathcal{L}_{m}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ are the respective
representations of the non-metricity scalar, the matter Lagrangian, and the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor. By employing a specific redshift function
and deriving the shape function through the Karmarkar condition, we examine the
fundamental geometric features required for a viable wormhole structure. The
analysis confirms the satisfaction of key conditions such as the throat
condition, flaring-out condition, and asymptotic flatness. A detailed study of
energy conditions for various values of model parameters reveals that the null
energy condition and averaged null energy condition are violated near the
throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. Additionally, thermodynamic
quantities such as temperature, pressure, specific heat, work density, and
energy flux are analyzed, all of which support the thermal and equilibrium
stability of the wormhole. Our findings demonstrate that even in extended
theories like $\mathcal{F}(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m},\mathcal{T})$ gravity, exotic
matter remains essential for sustaining traversable wormholes. This work lays
the foundation for further investigations into their stability under dynamical
perturbations and potential astrophysical implications.

Abstract: We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of
stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based
gravitational-wave detectors. We consider four distinct data-reconstruction
schemes for the co-inclination and anti-inclination orbital configurations of
the LISA-Taiji network. We find that the co-inclination configuration offers
its advantages over the anti-inclination one and can achieve signal-to-noise
ratios up to 17.3 for the vector modes and 10.4 for the scalar modes with the
energy density spectrum as $\Omega_{GW}^p(f)=10^{-12}$. Our method can be used
to measure beyond-general-relativity polarization modes of SGWBs at mHz
frequency band, opening a new avenue for testing alternative gravity theories.

### [43] [Regular black holes and reductions of thermodynamic phase spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09551)
*Meng-Sen Ma,Huai-Fan Li,Jian-Hua Shi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper addresses thermodynamic inconsistencies in regular black holes by proposing a novel thermodynamic framework, resolving inconsistencies through a reduced phase space approach. The method involves adding constraints to the phase space, leading to a revised first law. The paper also highlights the broader applicability of this framework to other black holes with similar constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper tackles the issue of thermodynamic inconsistency in regular black holes, suggesting a need for a more refined thermodynamic framework to accurately describe these objects. It likely aims to provide a more consistent understanding within the laws of black hole thermodynamics.

Method: The paper introduces a method involving the reduction of thermodynamic phase spaces by adding constraints among black hole parameters. This involves redefining thermodynamic quantities in the full phase space before applying the constraint to derive meaningful thermodynamic properties.

Result: The result is a new framework that resolves thermodynamic inconsistencies in regular black holes by correctly applying a reduced phase space approach, demonstrating its applicability beyond regular black holes to other constrained black holes.

Conclusion: The conclusion likely states that the proposed framework successfully resolves thermodynamic inconsistencies, providing a consistent thermodynamic description for regular black holes and highlighting its broad applicability to other types of constrained black holes. This offers a new perspective on black hole thermodynamics, integrating constraints into the phase space framework.

Abstract: The thermodynamic inconsistency observed in regular black holes is resolved
through the framework of reduced thermodynamic phase spaces. We demonstrate
that regular black holes are essentially induced from singular black holes by
adding an extra requirement, which imposes a constraint among black hole
parameters. This constraint reduces the thermodynamic phase space, rendering
the standard form of the first law of black hole thermodynamics inapplicable.
Accordingly, we propose a novel methodology to study the thermodynamic
properties of regular black holes. Thermodynamic quantities must be defined in
the full, unconstrained thermodynamic phase space of the underlying singular
black holes, only afterward is the constraint imposed to derive the consistent
and meaningful thermodynamic quantities of the regular black holes. Crucially,
this framework extends beyond regular black holes and applies universally to
any black hole with this kind of constraint.

### [44] [Light Rings, Accretion Disks and Shadows of Hayward Boson Stars in asymptotically AdS Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09563)
*Zhen-Hua Zhao,Yi-Ning Gu,Shu-Cong Liu,Yong-Qing Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Hayward boson stars in AdS spacetime show that the cosmological constant affects mass-radius relation, magnetic charge, photon rings, and ISCO. Ray-tracing reveals different photon ring configurations for frozen vs non-frozen boson stars depending on event horizon presence. Negative cosmological constant changes image structure by making photon rings less visible at certain angles in the shadow region.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical studies on boson stars in AdS to understand how cosmological parameters affect their structure and photon appearance.

Method: Numerical methods applied to study properties of boson stars in AdS, including ray-tracing of accretion disks.

Result: Multiple factors like mass-radius, critical charge, photon rings, and ISCO behavior are significantly influenced by the negative cosmological constant. Different image structures observed based on boson star states (frozen vs non-frozen).

Conclusion: AdS parameter significantly impacts the structural properties and optical appearance of boson stars and their accretion disks, providing deeper understanding of AdS gravity systems and implications for potential observations if such astrophysical objects exist.

Abstract: In this paper, we employ numerical methods to investigate the fundamental
properties of Hayward boson stars and the optical appearance of their accretion
disks in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Our results show that
variations in the negative cosmological constant significantly affect the
relationship between ADM mass and frequency, the critical magnetic monopole
charge, the size of the photon ring, and the kinematic characteristics of
particles at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Through ray-tracing
studies of the accretion disk's appearance, we find that for non-frozen boson
stars, the absence of an event horizon leads to multiple photon rings appearing
within the central shadow region. In contrast, for frozen boson stars, the
presence of a critical event horizon causes their images to resemble those of
Schwarzschild black holes, with no additional photon rings appearing within the
shadow region. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant significantly
alters the image structure: a smaller ISCO radius leads to photon rings being
obscured at specific viewing angles, preventing their appearance within the
shadow region.

Motivation: $f(G)$ 引力在拟合观测数据方面表现优异，因此作者希望通过动态系统分析研究其中的物质功率谱。

Method: 定义了$f(G)$ 模型的无量纲动力学变量，并对方程进行求解，得到物质和高斯-彭迪亚方程的动态系统，进而计算功率谱。

Result: 计算得出$f(G)$ 引力的物质功率谱与GR不同，具有规模依赖性。

Conclusion: $f(G)$ 引力中的物质功率谱在不同尺度上表现出差异。

Abstract: Cosmological models based on $f(G)$ gravity are efficient in fitting
different observational datasets at both background and perturbation levels.
This motivates the current study to take into account dynamical system analysis
to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of modified
Gauss-Bonnet gravity. After defining the dimensionless dynamical system
variables for a power-law $f(G)$ model, We derive the full system of equations
governing the energy density perturbations for both matter and Gauss-Bonnet
fluids using the $1+3$ covariant formalism. After solving the energy density
perturbation equations, we compute the matter power spectrum. The importance of
studying first order perturbations for the defined $f(G)$ model and the
relevance of different initial conditions in computing the matter power
spectrum are also stressed. It is reported that matter power spectrum for
$f(G)$ gravity, for a particular functional form of $f(G)$ model considered is
not scale invariant as the case for General Relativity.

Abstract: In this work we present a supersymmetric extension of the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime in the framework of quantum cosmology. We
achieve this by supersymmetrizing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a
Kantowski-Sachs cosmological model defined in the interior region between the
event and Cauchy horizons. We carry out this analysis following the Dirac and
the reduced phase space quantization approaches and compare them. In the
quantum regime we describe the novelties introduced by supersymmetry and
highlight the differences with the pure bosonic case. At the classical level we
analyse some limits that lead to metrics which are different than the usual
Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. We show that in some regions of the spacetime, true
singularities arise. In addition, we study the geodesics equation of a massive
particle moving in the region where supersymmetry contributions are dominant.

Result: 当Q较小时，存在发散模式，导致不稳定性；当Q足够大时，不稳定性消失。

Conclusion: 支持Penrose猜想，表明足够大的Q可以消除不稳定性，使配置稳定。

Abstract: General relativistic static spherically symmetric (SSS) asymptotically flat
configurations with scalar fields typically contain naked singularities at the
center. We consider minimally coupled scalar fields with power-law potentials
leading to the Coulomb asymptotic of the field $\phi(r)\approx Q/r$ for large
values of the radial variable r. The configurations are uniquely defined by
total mass and a Q-parameter characterizing the strength of the scalar field at
spatial infinity. The focus is on the linear stability against radial
(monopole) perturbations of the SSS configurations satisfying conditions of
asymptotic flatness. Our numerical investigations show the existence of
divergent modes of small perturbations against the static background, at least
for sufficiently small values of Q. This means instability of the
configurations, confirming the well-known Penrose conjecture about the
nonexistence of naked singularities - in this particular case. On the other
hand, we have not found divergent modes of linear radial perturbations for
sufficiently large Q.

Result: 多参数分析的结果与单参数分析类似，但有一个模型显示参数之间存在退化关系。

Conclusion: 多参数分析并不能显著提高对奇宇称和洛伦兹对称性的约束，但单参数分析足够有效。

Abstract: The growing catalog of gravitational wave (GW) detections by the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration enables increasingly stringent tests of general
relativity, particularly regarding possible parity and Lorentz violations.
While most current analyses employ single-parameter methods, varying one
deformation parameter at a time, modified gravity theories often predict
multiple, coexisting deviations. In this work, we construct four specific
multi-parameter GW waveform models incorporating parity- and Lorentz-violating
effects and perform full Bayesian parameter estimation to compare
multi-parameter and single-parameter constraints. We find that including
multiple deformation parameters yields constraints on individual parameters
that are generally comparable to those from single-parameter analyses, despite
one specific model showing a degeneracy between the deformation parameters. Our
results support the robustness of single-parameter tests for parity and Lorentz
symmetry of gravity in current and future GW observations.

### [49] [On the Infeasibility of Low-Energy Warp Drive via Metamaterial Gravitational Coupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09724)
*José Rodal*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: The warp-drive concept fails both theoretically and experimentally. Dynamical kappa(x) violates the strong equivalence principle by introducing a new force, and constant kappa(x) violates energy conservation. Experimental data rules it out.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The question is about analyzing a scientific paper's abstract related to warp-drives and gravitational coupling. The强度 of the motivation stems from the implications of warp-drives for physics and potential FTL travel. It's important to assess the validity of such speculative concepts which could have significant consequences if realizable.

Method: The analysis involves reviewing the field equations, applying Bianchi identities, discussing scalar-tensor theory, performing experimental data analysis, and applying junction condition tests. Each step checks the validity and physical consistency of the warp-drive idea. The method is comprehensive, ensuring all theoretical and empirical aspects are considered to reach a conclusion.

Result: The warp-drive idea, whether static or dynamic, has multiple flaws. Theoretical violations like energy non-conservation and breaking of the strong equivalence principle suggest impossibility. Experimental constraints from solar-system tests and others rule out any useful warp drive. The conclusion is that warp drive concepts are not viable.

Conclusion: The warp-drive concept as described in the paper is not feasible. Both theoretical framework issues and experimental data demonstrate its impossibility. This conclusion is supported by violations of energy conservation, the strong equivalence principle, and existing observational constraints. Therefore, the idea of constructing a low-energy warp drive using a scalar field is incorrect.

Abstract: Recent ``low-energy'' warp-drive concepts propose replacing the constant
gravitational coupling $\kappa_0$ with a spatially varying scalar field
$\kappa(x)$ set by an engineered metamaterial's electromagnetic response. We
show that the idea fails on both theoretical and experimental grounds. A
prescribed, non-dynamical $\kappa(x)$ in the field equation $G^{\mu\nu} =
\kappa(x)T^{\mu\nu}$ clashes with the contracted Bianchi identity, $\nabla_\mu
G^{\mu\nu} \equiv 0$, forcing $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} \neq 0$ and thus violating
local energy-momentum conservation. Making $\kappa(x)$ dynamical yields a
scalar-tensor theory in which the scalar mediates a new long-range force that
breaks the strong equivalence principle; Solar-System and pulsar-timing
experiments already restrict $|\gamma - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$, excluding any
technologically useful coupling. Junction-condition analysis further shows that
any interface where $\kappa$ changes demands a $\delta$-function layer of
stress-energy, while even steep continuous profiles are ruled out by
torsion-balance, lunar-laser, and spacecraft Doppler measurements. Hence the
concept is untenable: a non-dynamical scheme violates conservation laws, and
its scalar-tensor completion is falsified by existing data..

functions and elementary functions. As an application, we compute the
perihelion precession as a classical test of gravity within the Solar System
and use it to place observational constraints on the coupling parameter between
the scalar field and gravity.

Conclusion: 该研究为通胀理论提供了一个改进的框架，能够处理非线性效应，并在此框架下涵盖更多条件下的宇宙演化情况。

Abstract: We study effects of presence of a small amount of so-called anisotropic solid
remnant in the early post-inflationary Universe dominated by radiation. This
model is inspired by solid inflation and its generalizations with matter
described through a triplet of fields. In our model, the internal full global
Euclidean symmetry of this triplet is broken, which leads to an anisotropic
expansion of the Universe. Superhorizon scalar and vector perturbations grow,
while behavior of tensor perturbations remains the same as in the standard case
with Universe filled with only radiation. We also find a very interesting case
within the limit of a very small amount of the anisotropic solid remnant and
the longest possible duration of its presence, where size of vector
perturbations decreases with a different power of scale factor as in the
standard scenario. The obtained results improve agreement between the
observational data and the theoretical predictions of solid inflation in a case
with suppressed non-linear effects.

TL;DR: The paper discusses a spherically symmetric Einstein-Dirac system with multi-fermions in multiple shells, exploring their structure, interactions, and entropy changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by understanding how multiple fermions in different shells within an Einstein-Dirac system can exhibit complex structures and interactions, especially as they fragment and become delocalized at high redshifts.

Method: The authors used numerical methods to solve the system for different fermion numbers (N=2,6,12,20) in multi-shell configurations, analyzing the resulting solutions for structural properties and entropy.

Result: The multi-fermion systems show multi-peak structures and fragmentation in high-redshift regions. The radial pressure supports compactness, and entropy changes correlate with structural deformations.

Conclusion: The research contributes to understanding structural behavior and entropy dynamics in Einstein-Dirac multi-fermion configurations, revealing insights into gravitational and fermionic interactions in compact systems.

Abstract: We present multi-fermions in the spherically symmetric Einstein--Dirac
system. Dirac fermions are self-localized within a spherically symmetric
Einstein gravity, i.e., the Schwarzschild-like space-time metric. Most of
previous studies of the Einstein--Dirac system are restricted to two neutral
fermions or to many fermions with the same high-angular momentum filling a
single shell. Our model considers full-filling of fermions in multiple shells,
similarly to the conventional nuclear shell model. We solve the model for
fermion numbers $N_\textrm{f}=2,6,12$ and $20$, which can realize a
spherically-symmetric system. Even single-shell multi-fermions exhibit a
multi-peak structure and fragmentation in the high redshift region. The
behavior observed in our multi-shell model can be explained by interactions
between the shells and resulting delocalization. We also investigate the
pressure of the solutions which defines the existence (or absence) of
inter-shell interactions. The radial pressure is attractive, supporting
compactness of the solutions. Finally, we show the correlations between the
nontrivial changes in the Shannon entropy (a logarithmic measure of information
content) and the structural deformations of the solutions.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal thermodynamic characteristics of
black hole phase transitions in the low-temperature limit. Our results reveal
that, far below the critical point, the near zero-temperature region also
exhibits universal properties. By employing the Maxwell equal area law and
analyzing the coexistence curve of black hole phase transitions, we derive
three universal exponents: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $\gamma=d-3$, where $d$
represents the spacetime dimension number. Furthermore, additional studies show
that these exponents remain unchanged regardless of the black hole's charge and
spin. These universal exponents provide valuable insights into enhancing our
understanding of black hole thermodynamic phase transitions in low temperature
and shed light on the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.

Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of
density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The
PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)
detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the
mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that
PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to
PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing
constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these
constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future
gravitational wave observatories.

Conclusion: 这也表明广义不确定性原理对高维黑洞的修正效应依赖于维数，这些结果为理解广义不确定性原理和黑洞热力学提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We explore the impact of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on the
thermodynamics of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes. A
modified mass-temperature relation is derived under the assumption of local
equilibrium, revealing that the black hole evolves into a stable remnant with a
finite temperature, rather than completely evaporating. The corrected entropy,
obtained within this framework, deviates from the commonly expected logarithmic
form and aligns with similar findings in higher-dimensional
Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes. Our results support the argument that the
GUP-induced corrections to the black hole entropy are sensitive to the
dimension of spacetime.

Conclusion: 超旋转后的Kerr-Taub-NUT黑洞满足 cosmic censorship，并且第二阶变分验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Previously, we attempted to over-spin Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes with test
fields satisfying the null energy condition. We derived that a non-generic
over-spinning could be achieved with strict restrictions on the test field
modes and the initial space-time parameters. Here, we incorporate the effect of
the second order variations by evaluating the Sorce-Wald condition for
Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes. We calculate the second variation of the area for
the sub-collection of Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes for which over-spinning is
possible due to first order perturbations. We carry out an analysis to second
order, avoiding the common order of magnitude problems where the second order
variations appear in the form of a product with the square of an additional
small parameter. We derive that the contribution of the second order variations
fix the final state of the space-time parameters driving the Kerr-Taub-NUT
black hole away from extremality. The event horizon is preserved in accord with
the cosmic censorship conjecture and the laws of black hole dynamics.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly
fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar
Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,
making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass
IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range
of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band
observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the
Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.
We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two
population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform
distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their
combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.
Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for
high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH
binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely
insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more
suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$.
The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection
capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the
multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH
population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band
observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for
IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this
important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.

*Mirzabek Alloqulov,Mubasher Jamil,Sanjar Shaymatov,Qiang Wu,Mustapha Azreg-Aïnou*

TL;DR: The paper explores the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime and its implications for geodesics, oscillations, and accretion disk properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the behavior of spacetime around compact objects and its effect on particle motion and accretion disks is crucial for theoretical astrophysics.

Method: Analyzes geodesics, quasiperiodic oscillations, and accretion disk characteristics using mathematical derivations and modeling of galactic microquasars.

Result: Findings suggest that the Buchdahl parameter affects ISCO orbits, higher-frequency QPOs, and accretion disk properties, providing constraints for astrophysical observation.

Conclusion: The study integrates spacetime structure with observational astrophysics, offering new insights into compact object physics and their surrounding phenomena.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime metric and
investigate its aspects using the quasiperiodic oscillations and the accretion
disk due to the accreting matter. First, we focus on analyzing the geodesics of
particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime, together with the conserved
quantities such as specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles
orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We show that the
effect of the Buchdahl parameter $\tilde{k}$ increases as the radii of the ISCO
orbits decrease, resulting in shifting orbits toward the central object
compared to the Schwarzschild black hole case. We also consider astrophysical
epicyclic oscillations and derive their general expressions using implications
of circular motion of massive particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.
Further, we explore the astrophysical implications of observational
higher-frequency QPOs of the selected galactic microquasars of X-ray binary
systems to obtain the best-fit constraints on the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime
parameters. Finally, we consider the accretion disk around the
Buchdahl-inspired spacetime using implications of the ISCO parameters that
define the accretion disk's inner edge. We explore radiation properties of the
accretion disk and redshifted image and intensity of a lensed accretion disk
around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.

Abstract: The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity
which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be
given in completely distinct forms in different coordinates system.
Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is
particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is
proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish
solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl
invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely
different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates
transformation that connects the two metrics.

Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the apparent horizon of
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
gravity. We use the generalized definition of entropy for gravity theories in
higher dimensions to determine the main thermodynamic variables and to compare
their behavior with the corresponding quantities in Einstein's theory,
emphasizing the role of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and the dimension
number. By imposing the validity of the laws of thermodynamics, we show that
the apparent horizon can be interpreted thermodynamically as a dark energy
fluid, independently of the coupling constant and the dimension number. Using
the response functions, we determine the adiabatic index and the number of
thermally accesible degrees of freedom of the apparent horizon and argue that
this leads to a discretization of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant.

### [61] [Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10304)
*Tomasz Baka,Harsh Narola,Justin Janquart,Anuradha Samajdar,Tim Dietrich,Chris Van Den Broeck*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Third-gen gravitational wave detectors will have more signals, leading to parameter estimation biases. A new method combines joint parameter estimation, relative binning, and prior-informed Fisher matrix to mitigate these biases. The method improves upon previous techniques, showing 86% accuracy for close binaries, but still faces computational challenges. Alternative methods, like time-frequency overlap and reweighting, are also explored to estimate and reduce biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gravitational wave astronomy is advancing with new detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will improve detection capabilities. However, their increased sensitivity and frequency range also increase the complexity of data analysis, particularly in parameter estimation. This paper addresses the challenge of handling overlapping signals, which can introduce biases. The goal is to develop effective methods to mitigate these biases to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation for binary black hole mergers. The solution involves a combination of joint parameter estimation methods, relative binning, and computational optimizations to handle high data volumes efficiently while reducing biases.

Method: The paper discusses a joint parameter estimation method combined with relative binning to process overlapping signals from binary black holes. They employ a prior-informed Fisher matrix method to assess computational feasibility and determine when joint estimation is necessary. Additionally, a time-frequency overlap method is evaluated for accuracy, and a novel reweighting method is developed to estimate bias caused by overlaps accurately. All these methods involve computational simulations and statistical analysis to compare accuracy and efficiency under different noise conditions.

Result: The study finds that the time-frequency overlap method achieves 86% accuracy for close binary black hole mergers with no noise, while the reweighting method shows high accuracy (99% for zero noise, 98% for Gaussian noise) when biases are accounted for. The prior-informed Fisher matrix helps in identifying cases where joint parameter estimation is more efficient than single-signal methods. The overall approach aims to optimize computational resources while accurately estimating parameters despite overlapping signals, addressing the increased complexity of third-gen detectors. The methods are validated through simulations, providing a framework for practical implementation in future gravitational wave observations.

Conclusion: This paper presents a comprehensive approach to handling parameter estimation biases caused by overlapping signals in third-generation gravitational wave detectors. By combining joint parameter estimation, relative binning, and innovative bias mitigation methods, the research provides a robust framework for accurately extracting binary black hole parameters from complex data sets. The evaluation of different techniques allows for efficient resource allocation, balancing accuracy and computational demands. This work is crucial for advancing gravitational wave astronomy, ensuring reliable parameter estimation even as the detector sensitivity increases.

Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and
Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current
detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the
number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals
overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases
in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter
estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on
overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and
higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive
than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed
Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias
to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler
methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including
the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate
the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable.
The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole
mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps,
where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify
how much the overlapping signals affect it.We show it has 99% accuracy for zero
noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional
standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.

*Jibril Ben Achour,Clara Montagnon,Hugo Roussille*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method to study algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr black hole using the metric formalism, offering an exact analytical solution and insights into the zero modes and charge-deforming perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study of perturbations of the Kerr black hole is fundamental in understanding gravitational waves and testing general relativity, especially in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes.

Method: The paper employs a method involving linearization around the Kerr solution and solving partial differential equations governing the perturbations. The algorithm developed allows for solving these equations up to the third order in the small spin approximation.

Result: By linearizing and solving the perturbation equations, the paper provides exact analytical expressions for the perturbations responsible for mass and spin shifts, as well as those generating NUT and acceleration charges, demonstrating a solution entirely within the metric formulation.

Conclusion: This approach offers a new framework for analyzing Kerr perturbations and may contribute to uncovering hidden symmetries in Kerr geometry.

Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in
the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the
Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear
perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this
subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that
end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space
of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we
obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics
of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the
small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution
of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study
the zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of
the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates
needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed
expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and
acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized
Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare
example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely
in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for
hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.

Conclusion: 广义相对论中毛发猜想在 AdS 情况下存在例外，极化粒子可能破坏传统范围内视界。

Abstract: We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture by analyzing the
dynamics of spinning timelike particles dropped along the rotational axis of an
extremal Kerr (anti)de Sitter black hole. This idea was first considered in a
seminal paper by Wald and later by Needham but both analyses were restricted to
asymptotically flat spacetimes. We generalize these studies, involving spinning
particles, to rotating spacetimes with non vanishing cosmological constant. We
examine whether the absorption of such particles can overspin the black hole
beyond extremality, potentially leading to the formation of a naked
singularity. In asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, we find that particles that
are captured cannot overspin the black hole. For generic initial conditions,
similar conclusions hold also with anti-de Sitter asymptotics. However, in this
case, we identify a narrow set of finely tuned trajectories, corresponding to
particles injected very close to the horizon, that lead to the disruption of
the event horizon.

Abstract: This paper investigates the power and efficiency of energy extraction via
magnetic reconnection in the Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ black hole, focusing primarily
on the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the
black hole event horizon, boundary of the ergosphere, and photon sphere radius,
we first study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in circular
orbit region. We plot the allowed regions for energy extraction and present the
energy extraction power and efficiency, comparing them with the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. It was found that energy extraction is still
possible even at a spin parameter of 0.5, which is lower than previous results,
and the power can be higher than the BZ process in certain regions. In
addition, we find the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS radius $l$
contribute to lowering the spin threshold required for energy extraction. We
also study the energy extraction in the plunging region by analyzing the
allowed regions for energy extraction, and the power as well as efficiency. It
was found that the energy extraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25.
Especially, we find that parameter $b$ promotes lowering the energy extraction
spin threshold while $l$ suppresses it, which is different from the circular
orbit case. Moreover, the power and efficiency of energy extraction in the
plunging region are higher than in the circular orbit region, indicating a
stronger energy extraction capability in the plunging region.

Main category: nlin.CD

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding traffic congestion, which is a significant issue both in daily life and economic terms. It aims to connect theoretical models with empirical data, providing a foundation for practical solutions in traffic management.

Method: The study uses extensive, high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from the I-24 MOTION testbed to analyze traffic flow dynamics, identifying statistical properties like percolation and universality.

Result: The paper identifies that traffic flow exhibits a percolation phase transition and follows Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality, implying that traffic jams, though chaotic, have predictable statistical behavior.

Conclusion: This finding not only deepens our understanding of traffic dynamics but also paves the way for developing advanced forecasting models and management strategies based on universal scaling laws, which could significantly enhance traffic efficiency and economic impact.

Abstract: Traffic congestion, a daily frustration for millions and a multi-billion
dollar drain on economies, has long resisted deep physical understanding. While
simple theoretical models of traffic flow have suggested connections to
critical phenomena and non-equilibrium universality, direct empirical
validation is lacking. Using extensive, high-resolution vehicle trajectory data
from the I-24 MOTION testbed, we show that traffic flow exhibits both a
percolation phase transition that is self-organized critical and fluctuations
consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in 1+1 dimensions. This
suggests that the complex and seemingly chaotic formation of traffic jams has
predictable statistical properties, which opens new avenues in traffic science
for developing advanced forecasting and management strategies grounded in
universal scaling laws.

Abstract: Low-dimensional chaotic systems such as the Lorenz-63 model are commonly used
to benchmark system-agnostic methods for learning dynamics from data. Here we
show that learning from noise-free observations in such systems can be achieved
up to machine precision: using ordinary least squares regression on high-degree
polynomial features with 512-bit arithmetic, our method exceeds the accuracy of
standard 64-bit numerical ODE solvers of the true underlying dynamical systems.
Depending on the configuration, we obtain valid prediction times of 32 to 105
Lyapunov times for the Lorenz-63 system, dramatically outperforming prior work
that reaches 13 Lyapunov times at most. We further validate our results on
Thomas' Cyclically Symmetric Attractor, a non-polynomial chaotic system that is
considerably more complex than the Lorenz-63 model, and show that similar
results extend also to higher dimensions using the spatiotemporally chaotic
Lorenz-96 model. Our findings suggest that learning low-dimensional chaotic
systems from noise-free data is a solved problem.

Motivation: The extension of nonlinear PDEs to higher dimensions is crucial for various applications and theoretical advancements, making integrable systems in 3+1 dimensions a significant target.

Result: A new (3+1)-dimensional mKP equation with complex time and its solution through ∂̄-formalism is presented.

Conclusion: This work brings progress toward constructing integrable evolution equations in higher dimensions, enabling insights into complex physical and mathematical phenomena.

Abstract: Constructing integrable evolution nonlinear PDEs in three spatial dimensions
is one of the most important open problems in the area of integrability. Fokas
achieved progress in 2006 by constructing integrable nonlinear equations in 4+2
dimensions, but the reduction to 3+1 dimensions remained open until 2022 when
he introduced a suitable nonlinear Fourier transform to achieve this reduction
for the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) equation. Here, the integrable
generalization of the modified KP (mKP) equation has been presented which has
the novelty that it involves complex time and preserves Laplace's equation. The
(3+1)-dimensional mKP equation is obtained by imposing the requirement of real
time. Then, the spectral analysis of the eigenvalue equation is given and the
solution of the $\bar{\partial}$-problem is demonstrated based on Cauchy-Green
formula. Finally, a novel $\bar{\partial}$-formalism for the initial value
problem of the (3+1)-dimensional mKP equation is worked out.

Abstract: The study of anyons in topologically ordered quantum systems has mainly
relied on edge-state interferometry. However, realizing controlled braiding of
anyons necessitates the ability to detect and manipulate individual anyons
within the bulk. Here, we propose and theoretically investigate a first step
toward this goal by demonstrating that a long-lived, optically generated
interlayer exciton can bind to a quasihole in a fractional quantum Hall state,
forming a composite excitation we term an anyon-trion. Using exact
diagonalization, we show that mobile anyon-trions possess a binding energy of
approximately 0.5 meV, whereas static anyon-trions exhibit a binding energy of
about 0.9 meV, that is linearly proportional to the quasiholes fractional
charge. An experimental realization based on photoluminescence from localized
interlayer excitons in a quantum twisting microscope setup should allow for a
direct optical observation of anyon-trions.

Motivation: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is a key challenge in quantum computing. This paper addresses it by linking dissipation to bulk material properties, providing insights for designing better qubits.

Method: They analyze various materials and geometries, measure microwave dissipation, and correlate it with superfluid density.

Result: They discovered a scaling law between microwave dissipation and superfluid density, showing the fundamental limit of coherence based on material properties.

Conclusion: This leads to guidelines for selecting high-quality materials and designing quantum circuits with longer coherence times.

Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing
quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect
conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven
by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal
scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk
property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our
analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries,
from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high
quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This
scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface
dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium
quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the
superconducting gap. Our findings define a fundamental limit to coherence set
by intrinsic material properties and provide a predictive framework for
selecting materials and the design of next-generation superconducting quantum
circuits.

Result: The results show that the spin Hall current is transverse and has a large spin Hall angle, with zero net charge. The efficiency of the spin-to-charge conversion is high when the Fermi surfaces are spin-split in a specific orientation relative to the junction's normal direction.

Conclusion: The proposed tunneling spin Hall effect provides a promising mechanism for efficient charge-to-spin conversion, which can be utilized in the design of spintronic devices for future applications.

Abstract: We propose a tunneling spin Hall effect in a normal metal/$p$-wave
magnet/superconductor junction. It is found that the Andreev reflection in the
normal lead is spin-dependent and exhibits strong asymmetry with respect to the
transverse momentum, giving rise to a pure transverse spin Hall current with
zero net charge. The transverse spin conductance is analytically derived using
the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, revealing that the predicted spin
Hall effect is governed by the direction of the Fermi surface splitting in the
$p$-wave magnet. A finite transverse spin current with a large spin Hall angle
arises when the line connecting the centers of the spin-split Fermi surfaces is
perpendicular to the normal direction of the junction, which indicates a highly
efficient charge-to-spin conversion, suggesting potential applications in
spintronic devices.

Abstract: $\mathrm{Mn_3Sn}(0\overline{1}\overline{1}0)[0001]$ experiences a tensile
strain when grown epitaxially on $\mathrm{MgO}(110)[001]$, and thus the energy
landscape changes from six-fold symmetry to two-fold symmetry. External
magnetic field further breaks the symmetry and the \textcolor{black}{resulting
energy landscape is sensitive to} the field orientation relative to the easy
axis. \textcolor{black}{In the presence of thermal noise,} the relaxation of
the magnetic octupole moment in \textcolor{black}{a strained Mn$_3$Sn film} is
composed of four distinct escape processes involving the two saddle points and
two equilibrium states in the energy landscape. Here, we apply harmonic
transition-state theory to derive analytical expressions for the inter-well
escape time and octupole moment relaxation time, both influenced by an external
symmetry-breaking magnetic field and finite thermal noise in the
intermediate-to-high damping regime. The analytical predictions are in strong
agreement with comprehensive numerical simulations based on coupled LLG
equations. The results presented here are crucial toward realizing Mn$_3$Sn's
applications in random number generation and probabilistic computing.

Abstract: Thermal and electrical injection and transport of magnon spins in magnetic
insulators is conventionally understood by the non-equilibrium population of
magnons. However, this view is challenged by several recent experiments in
noncollinear antiferromagnets, which urge a thorough theoretical investigation
at the fundamental level. We find that the magnon spin in antiferromagnets is
described by a matrix, so even when the diagonal terms -- spins carried by
population -- vanish, the off-diagonal correlations transmit magnon spins. Our
quantum theory shows that a net spin-flip of electrons in adjacent conductors
creates quantum coherence between magnon states, which transports magnon spins
in canted antiferromagnets, even without a definite phase difference between
magnon modes in the incoherent process. It reveals that the pumped magnon
correlation is not conserved due to an intrinsic spin torque, which causes
dephasing and strong spatial spin oscillations during transport; both are
enhanced by magnetic fields. Spin transfer to proximity conductors can cause
extrinsic dephasing, which suppresses spin oscillations and thereby gates spin
transport.

Abstract: The quantum geometry plays a crucial role in the nonlinear transport of
quantum materials. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport formalism to study the
magnetic control of nonlinear transport induced by the quantum metric in
two-dimensional systems with different types of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It
is shown that the nonlinear conductivity is strongly dependent on the direction
of a field and reveals significant spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the
field-direction dependent relations are distinct for different SOCs. In
addition, it is demonstrated that the contributions from the quantum metric and
Drude mechanism are distinguishable due to their opposite signs or distinct
anisotropy relations. We further derive the analytical formulas for the
anisotropic nonlinear conductivity, in exact agreement with numerical results.
Our work shines more light on the interplay between the nonlinear transport and
quantum geometry.

Main category: cond-mat.mes-hall

TL;DR: This paper introduces a symmetry-engineering approach to induce altermagnetism in 2D antiferromagnetic materials via surface adsorption, detailing how breaking specific symmetries leads to spin-split electronic states without spin-orbit coupling, supported by examples and computational evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in altermagnets, which exhibit unique properties and potential applications, has led researchers to seek innovative methods to induce and control altermagnetic behavior in 2D materials. This paper addresses this need by proposing a symmetry-based strategy, which is both strategic and practical, aiming to unlock the full potential of altermagnetic materials for various technological applications.

Method: The authors employ spin group theory to systematically analyze and classify symmetry operations in 80 layer groups, identifying 63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics. They use first-principles calculations and adsorption analysis to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of their method.

Result: The method successfully induces altermagnetic properties through adsorption of specific molecules on certain 2D antiferromagnetic materials, as validated by computational models and experiments specific to monolayer materials like VPS3 and MnPSe3.

Conclusion: This paper provides a universal framework for inducing altermagnetism in 2D antiferromagnets, which can be applied to various materials and is a significant step towards realizing spin-split functionalities for advanced quantum technologies.

Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by zero net magnetization and momentum-dependent
spin splitting, have recently garnered significant attention due to their
potential applications in a variety of fields. Here, we propose a
symmetry-engineering strategy to unlock altermagnetism in two dimensional (2D)
antiferromagnetic systems via surface adsorption of atoms or molecules. By
employing spin group theory, we systematically demonstrate that selectively
breaking symmetry operations, specifically those protecting spin degeneracy in
momentum space, enables the emergence of nonrelativistic spin-split electronic
states. Meanwhile, preserving rotation or mirror symmetries connecting opposite
sublattices ensures zero net magnetization. Through a comprehensive
classification of all symmetry operations across 80 layer groups, we identify
63 antiferromagnetic spin point groups (SPGs) describing 2D materials and
further isolate 15 groups that can host altermagnetic characteristics through
surface adsorption. Exemplified with monolayer antiferromagnetic VPS_3 and
MnPSe_3, we show that oxygen adsorption on VPS_3 and NH_3 adsorption on MnPSe_3
selectively disrupt PT symmetry while retaining the [C2||m] symmetry. This
engineered symmetry reduction induces pronounced spin splitting in their band
structures without spin-orbit coupling, as confirmed by first-principles
calculations. Furthermore, adsorption energy analysis and thermal stability
phase diagrams under varying coverage regimes reveal optimal configurations for
experimental feasibility. Our work establishes a universal symmetry-engineering
framework to expand the family of altermagnetic materials, offering a versatile
pathway to tailor spin-split functionalities in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets for advanced quantum applications.

evaluate the interlayer energy offset. By extending this platform to triangular

Abstract: Multi-donor architecture developed on the base of silicon technology holds
significant potential towards room-temperature qubit and other single-electron
tunneling (SET) functionalities. However, within such architecture, the overlap
of multiple donor wave-functions results in a complex internal electronic
configuration with discrete energy levels. Probing these discrete states,
observed as multiple conductance peaks, is essential for understanding
inter-donor coupling and exchange interactions towards coherent electron
transfer. In this direction, we have experimentally demonstrated one-by-one
electron filling within multiple-donor molecules with the fundamental analysis
of clear and sustained quantum Coulomb blockade (QCB) effect. Moreover, the
underlying physics of molecular orbitals, where the increasing energy leads to
a larger spatial extent of the corresponding orbital, has been reflected by the
systematic decrement of the respective charging-energies. The molecular energy
levels, resulting from the orbital hybridization of individual donors, are also
confirmed through first-principles simulations using density functional theory
(DFT). Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations based on the orthodox theory of
Coulomb blockade support the observed QCB characteristics.

Abstract: We predict a new class of quantum Hall phenomena in completely neutral
systems, demonstrating that the interplay between radial electric fields and
dipole moments induces exact $e^2/h$ quantization without the need for Landau

reveals that: (i) the singularity of line charges does not destroy topological
protection, (ii) spin-control of quantization emerges from boundary conditions
alone, and (iii) the effect persists up to 25 K, surpassing typical neutral
systems. These findings establish electric field engineering as a viable route

Abstract: Empirical rate-and-state friction laws are widely used in geophysics and
engineering to simulate interface slip. They postulate that the friction
coefficient depends on the local slip rate and a state variable that reflects
the history of slip. Depending on the parameters, rate-and-state friction can
be either rate-strengthening, leading to steady slip, or rate-weakening,
leading to unsteady stick-slip behavior modeling earthquakes. Rate-and-state
friction does not have a potential or variational formulation, making implicit
solution approaches difficult and implementation numerically expensive. In this
work, we propose a potential formulation for the rate-and-state friction. We
formulate the potentials as neural networks and train them so that the
resulting behavior emulates the empirical rate-and-state friction. We show that
this potential formulation enables implicit time discretization leading to
efficient numerical implementation.

Motivation: They address the challenge of reducing the threshold current in spin Hall nano-oscillators, which is crucial for improving energy efficiency in neuromorphic computing and high-frequency technologies.

Method: The study uses DC-bias spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance to measure the spin Hall efficiency and threshold current in SHNOs based on different PtBi compositions.

Result: PtBi alloys show a threefold increase in spin Hall efficiency and a significant reduction in threshold current, making SHNOs more suitable for advanced applications.

Conclusion: PtBi alloys offer a promising alternative for enhancing spin Hall effect performance, paving the way for more efficient neuromorphic computing devices.

Abstract: Spin-orbit-torque-driven auto-oscillations in spin Hall nano-oscillators
(SHNOs) offer a transformative pathway toward energy-efficient, nanoscale
microwave devices for next-generation neuromorphic computing and high-frequency
technologies. A key requirement for achieving robust, sustained oscillations is
reducing the threshold current ($I_{\text{th}}$), strongly governed by spin
Hall efficiency ($\theta_{\text{SH}}$). However, conventional strategies to
enhance $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ face trade-offs, including high longitudinal
resistivity, interfacial effects, and symmetry-breaking torques that limit
performance. Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement of the bulk spin
Hall effect in PtBi alloys, achieving over a threefold increase in
$\theta_{\text{SH}}$, from 0.07 in pure Pt to 0.24 in Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$ and
0.19 in Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$, as extracted from DC-bias spin-torque
ferromagnetic resonance. The enhanced $\theta_{\text{SH}}$ originates from
bulk-dominated, extrinsic side-jump scattering across all PtBi compositions.
Correspondingly, we observe a 42\% and 32\% reduction in $I_{\text{th}}$ in 100
nm SHNOs based on Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{94.0}$Bi$_{6.0}$(4 nm)
and Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$(3 nm)/Pt$_{91.3}$Bi$_{8.7}$(4 nm), respectively.
Structural characterization reveals reduced Pt crystallinity, along with
emergence of preferred crystallographic orientations upon introducing higher Bi
concentrations. Together, these results position PtBi alloys as a compelling
alternative to conventional 5$d$ transition metals, enabling enhanced
$\theta_{\text{SH}}$ and significantly lower $I_{\text{th}}$, thus opening new
avenues for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing and magnetic random access
memory.

Abstract: Periodic drive is an intriguing way of creating topological phases in a
non-topological setup. However, most systems are often studied as a closed
system, despite being always in contact with the environment, which induces
dissipation. Here, we investigate a periodically driven Rashba nanowire in
proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor in a dissipative background. The
system's dynamics is governed by a periodic Liouvillian operator, from which we
construct the Liouvillian time-evolution operator and use the
third-quantization method to obtain the `Floquet damping matrix', which
captures the spectral and topological properties of the system. We show that
the system exhibits edge-localized topological Majorana $0$-modes (MZMs) and
$\pi$-modes (MPMs). Additionally, the system also supports a trivial $0$-modes
(TZMs) and $\pi$-modes (TPMs), which are also localized at the edges of the
system. The MZMs and the MPMs are connected to the bulk topology and carry a
bulk topological invariant, while the emergence of TZMs and TPMs is primarily
tied to exceptional points and is topologically trivial. We study the
topological phase diagrams in terms of the topological invariants and show that
the dissipation can modify the topological phase diagram substantially and even
induce topological phases in the system. Our work extends the understanding of
a driven-dissipative topological superconductor.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that the handedness of a resonant mode is an intrinsic
property. We show that, by tailoring the polarization and handedness of
alternating spin-orbit torques used as the driving force, the polarization
state and handedness of inertial resonant modes in an antiferromagnet can be
actively controlled. In contrast to ferromagnets, whose resonant-mode
polarization is essentially fixed, antiferromagnetic inertial modes can
continuously evolve from elliptic through circular to linear polarization as
the driving polarization is varied. We further identify an inertia-dependent
critical degree of driving polarization at which the mode becomes linearly
polarized while its handedness reverses.

Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advancements in scanning optical
stroboscopic confocal microscopy and spectroscopy measurements, which have
facilitated exceptional energy-space-time resolution for investigating edge and
bulk dynamics in fractional quantum Hall systems, we formulated a model for the
pump-probe process on the edge. Starting with a ground state, we applied a tip
potential near the fractional quantum Hall liquid edge, which was subsequently
turned off after a defined time duration. By examining how the specific nature
of the tip potential influences the evolution of the wave function and its
distribution in energy spectrum, we identify that quench dynamics of the edge
pulse leads to excitations that spread both along the edge and perpendicularly
into the bulk. Moreover, magnetoroton excitations are predominant among the
bulk excitations. These results align well with the experimental observations.
Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of the tip's position, intensity, and
duration on the dynamics.

system incorporates a custom-designed phase-locked loop and automatic gain
control, along with passive vibration isolation, enabling precise measurements
of local chemical potential even under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate the
performance of this setup by measuring hBN encapsulated monolayer graphene
(MLG), revealing spatially resolved electronic inhomogeneities and charge
puddles. Our measurements clearly capture temperature-dependent variations in
the chemical potential near the charge neutrality point (CNP), consistent with
the linear band dispersion of MLG and interaction-driven renormalization of
Fermi velocity. This work highlights the robust sensitivity and stability of
our system, making it a versatile local probe of quantum phases in van der
Waals heterostructures.

Abstract: We have experimentally and theoretically investigated the spin transport in
Fe/Mg/MgO/MgAl2O4/n+-Si(001) ferromagnetic tunnel junctions on a Si substrate,
by systematically varying the thickness combination of amorphous MgO and
MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier layers with a sliding shutter between the evaporation
sources and substrate during electron-beam evaporation. A technical advantage
of MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si
substrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,
which enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel
barrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO
interface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling
electrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness
(tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness
combinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm.
Since this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch
in semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple
phenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths,
which have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths.
Our numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin
polarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments,
indicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the
lower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins
for this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms. Our
analysis method provides an insight into the detailed spin transport physics in
semiconductor-based ferromagnetic junctions, particularly, with a very thin
tunnel barrier layer.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a control scheme for VRMs that combines linear and nonlinear controllers to improve voltage regulation under fast load changes. Simulations show over ten times faster recovery than linear control alone, with hardware tests confirming stable performance with zero steady-state error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving power supply reliability for AI workloads is crucial, especially with fluctuating and step-like loads. This paper addresses the challenge through a novel control strategy combining linear and nonlinear control methods for efficient voltage regulation.

Method: The paper derives a small-signal model using a 5S framework for Series-Capacitor Buck converters, enabling direct digital design. It employs Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) for time-optimal control strategies to handle large-signal transients and proposes a transition logic to integrate high-bandwidth and large-signal controllers. Simulations and hardware tests are conducted to validate performance.

Result: The integration of linear and nonlinear controllers significantly improves the speed of voltage recovery under heavy load steps, achieving up to ten times faster response compared to linear control alone, with stabilized performance under load disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed control scheme effectively addresses challenges in voltage regulation for data center VRMs, demonstrating robust performance under fast-changing loads with zero steady-state error, ensuring reliable AI workload support.

Abstract: Fast-response voltage regulation is essential for data-center Voltage
Regulation Modules (VRMs) powering Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads,
which exhibit both small-amplitude fluctuations and abrupt full-load steps.
This paper introduces a control scheme that integrates a linear controller and
a nonlinear controller for variable-frequency Series-Capacitor Buck (SCB)
converters. First, an accurate small-signal model is derived via a
Switching-Synchronized Sampled State-Space (5S) framework, yielding
discrete-time transfer functions and root-locus insights for direct digital
design. A critical concern for SCB converters is series-capacitor oscillation
during heavy load steps if the strict switching sequence is not maintained. To
accelerate large-signal transients, a time-optimal control strategy based on
Pontryagins Maximum Principle (PMP) relaxes the switching constraints to
compute time-optimal switching sequences. A transition logic is then proposed
to integrate the high-bandwidth small-signal controller and the large-signal
controller. Simulations demonstrate a rapid output voltage recovery under a
heavy load step-up, over ten times faster than a linear controller-only design.
Preliminary hardware tests indicate a stable rejection to heavy load
disturbances with zero steady-state error.

Abstract: The dynamics of strongly interacting quantum fluids such as Helium II are
fundamentally distinct from those of dilute, contact-interacting atomic
Bose-Einstein condensates. Most dramatically, superfluids with finite-range
interactions can support excitations with a roton-like dispersion, exhibiting a
minimum at finite wavenumber. Here we introduce a mechanism through which roton
spectra can emerge in superfluids without any nonlocal interactions, instead
resulting from the collective excitations of two counterflowing, zero-range
interacting condensates. As our mechanism relies only on the nonlinear dynamics
of classical fields, this work opens the door to the realization of roton
dynamics in the broad class of physical systems governed by coupled
nonlinear-Schr\"odinger equations.

Motivation: Understanding unconventional superconductivity is crucial in the field of condensed matter physics, especially in systems exhibiting strongly correlated electron behavior. This paper addresses the search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry, which remains a central topic in the field.

Method: This research employs the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method on a spin-triplet pairing model in a two-dimensional Hubbard framework.

Result: The study provides evidence for spin-triplet p-wave pairing as the dominant pairing channel near a type-II van Hove singularity through vertex contributions to pairing susceptibility, with this effect becoming more prominent as interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate regime.

Conclusion: This analysis suggests that spin-triplet p-wave superconductivity can be reliably realized in a repulsive Hubbard model from an unbiased numerical approach, indicating strong spin correlations play a key role near the type-II van Hove singularity.

Abstract: The search for superconductivity with unconventional pairing symmetry has
been a central focus in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In
this work, we report a numerically exact study of the spin-triplet pairing in a
two-dimensional Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, employing
Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method. The model includes
next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor hopping terms, and maintains
spin balance. By tuning the fermion filling close to a type-II van Hove
singularity (vHs) in the model, we numerically investigate the ordering
tendencies of several possible pairing channels with different symmetries. Our
numerical results provide clear evidence for the spin-triplet $p$-wave pairing
instability approaching low temperatures, as revealed by the vertex
contribution to the pairing susceptibility. This signature becomes increasingly
pronounced as the interaction strength increases in the weak to intermediate
regime. We further find that, near the type-II vHs, the dominant spin-spin
correlations in the system are ferromagnetic, suggesting its close relation to
the spin-triplet pairing instability. Our findings offer a reliable approach to
realize the spin-triplet $p$-wave superfluidity in the repulsive Hubbard model,
from an unbiased numerical perspective.

Abstract: We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting bosons on a
two-dimensional Hubbard lattice in the strongly interacting regime, taking into
account the dynamics of condensate amplitude as well as the direct transport of
non-condensed fluctuations. To that end we develop a selfconsistent
density-matrix approach which goes beyond the standard Gutzwiller mean-field
theory. Starting from the Liouville-von-Neumann equation we derive a quantum
master equation for the time evolution of the system's local density matrix at
each lattice site, with a dynamical bath that represents the rest of the
system. We apply this method to the expansion dynamics of an initially prepared
cloud of interacting bosons in an optical lattice. We observe a ballistic
expansion of the condensate, as expected, followed by slow, diffusive transport
of the normal bosons. We discuss, in particular, the robustness of the Mott
insulator phase as well as its melting due to incoherent transport. The method
should be applicable to various models of lattice bosons in the strongly
correlated regime.

Abstract: A central challenge in strongly interacting many-body systems is
understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics. Here, we study the many-body
magnetic dynamics of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model by developing a
two-component extension of nonequilibrium bosonic dynamical mean-field theory.
Using this numerical method, we uncover rich quantum spin dynamics via
inter-species interaction quenches. A sudden ramp-up of interactions induces
slow thermalization, leading to a long-lived metastable state, whereas
quenching to weak interactions results in rapid thermal equilibrium, featuring
a two-step relaxation behavior through distinct exponential decays.
Furthermore, under periodic modulation of the inter-species interactions,
emergent Floquet dynamics drives a transition from a magnetic to an unordered

Abstract: A harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) leads to topologically
trivial compact states. Because of the long-range nonlocal dipole-dipole
interaction, a strongly dipolar BEC revealed many novel phenomena. Here we show
that in a strongly dipolar BEC one can have a hollow cylindrical
quasi-one-dimensional metastable droplet with ring topology while the system is
trapped only in the $x$-$y$ plane by a harmonic potential and a Gaussian hill
potential at the center and untrapped along the polarization $z$ axis. In this
numerical investigation we use the imaginary-time propagation of a mean-field
model where we include the Lee-Huang-Yang interaction, suitably modified for
dipolar systems. Being metastable, these droplets are weakly stable and we use
real-time propagation to investigate its dynamics and establish stability.

*Saptarshi Majumdar,Aleksandra Petković*

Main category: cond-mat.quant-gas

TL;DR: The paper studies the dynamic behavior of a quantum impurity in a 1D gas of weakly interacting bosons under nonequilibrium conditions. It identifies different regimes of relaxation depending on the impurity's mass, coupling strength, and initial velocity. For a sufficiently heavy and rapidly moving impurity, a soliton emission occurs, slowing down relaxation and reversing the impurity's direction of motion. For larger boson repulsion, metastable states and cusps in the ground state energy are observed, affecting the dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the dynamic behavior of impurities in quantum systems is crucial for various applications in condensed matter physics, such as transport phenomena and information processing. This paper contributes to the field by exploring the relaxation dynamics in a specific 1D model, which could provide insights into more complex systems.

Method: The authors likely used a combination of analytical methods such as Bethe ansatz and effective field theories, along with numerical simulations like quantum Monte Carlo or exact diagonalization, to study the system's dynamics under different conditions of impurity mass and boson interactions.

Result: The study reveals several key findings: (1) for a heavy and fast-moving impurity, soliton emissions and reversed motion are observed; (2) taller and higher-shaped solitons form due to heavier masses and stronger boson repulsion; (3) cusps in the ground state energy and metastable states influence the relaxation dynamics.

Conclusion: The findings enhance our understanding of impurity dynamics in quantum systems, particularly in 1D under strong boson interactions. These results have implications for both fundamental physics and potential applications in quantum technology and materials science where impurities and excitations play a significant role.

Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum impurity immersed with a finite
velocity in a one-dimensional system of weakly interacting bosons is studied.
We uncover and characterize different regimes of relaxation dynamics. We find
that the final impurity velocity remains constant in a large interval of
sufficiently big and realistic initial velocities. The underlying physical
mechanism is the emission of the dispersive density shock waves that carry away
the excess of the initial impurity momentum, while locally the system remains
in the same stationary state. In contrast, a heavy impurity with the same
coupling constant relaxes differently and the regime of constant final velocity
disappears. Furthermore, a fast heavy impurity exhibits damped velocity
oscillations in time before reaching a stationary state. This process is
accompanied by the oscillations of the local depletion of the boson density
around the impurity, until their positions coincide and they continue the
motion together. Decreasing the impurity-boson coupling or increasing the
strength of repulsion between bosons, the oscillations get amplified. In the
case of a heavy impurity with the mass bigger than the critical one, the ground
state energy as a function of momentum exhibits cusps and metastable branches.
We show that they manifest themselves by a soliton emission, a considerable
slowing down of the relaxation, and a change of the impurity direction of
motion with respect to the initial one.

prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \leq t \leq 0$ ns relative to
the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to
visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for

TL;DR: This paper presents the design and_first few results of the CCM detector, focusing on its capability to detect MeV-scale neutrino emissions using LAr as a light collection medium. Key innovations include optimized light collection with high efficiency and detailed modeling of photon propagation effects such as anomalous dispersion, Mie scattering, and Cherenkov radiation. The approach minimizes the need for stringent LAr purity requirements compared to traditional methods. The results are built using a differentiable Monte Carlo simulation and PMT characterization, providing a reliable basis for detecting and imaging these elusive signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to explore alternative methods for detecting MeV-scale neutrinos, which are not easily captured by conventional detectors. Traditional methods often require high-purity liquid argon, which can be challenging and costly to produce. The CCM experiment aims to reduce these requirements by using the light emitted by charged particles as the detection signal, thereby simplifying the setup and reducing the reliance on pure LAr. This approach could significantly expand the range of physics experiments that can be conducted without specialized pure LAr resources.

Method: The CCM experiment employs a liquid argon detector instrumented with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) covering a 7-ton fiducial volume. The method involves using a Monte Carlo simulation to model photon propagation through liquid argon, taking into account factors like anomalous dispersion of the refractive index, Mie scattering, and Cherenkov radiation. The simulation helps predict the timing and spatial distribution of light produced by scintillation and Cherenkov effects. Additionally, detailed characterization of the PMT response was performed to optimize the detector's sensitivity and reduce noise. The design focuses on achieving high efficiency in light collection while minimizing contamination from common impurities.

Result: The paper reports successful measurements of LAr light production and propagation parameters, including timing and spatial distributions, accounting for various optical effects. The results show that the CCM detector can accurately predict the behavior of light in liquid argon under different conditions, including the impact of anomalous dispersion, Mie scattering, and Cherenkov emission. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the liquid argon-based approach for detecting MeV-scale neutrino emissions. The accurate modeling and characterization contribute to the overall performance of the detector, enabling precise timing and imaging measurements necessary for neutrino physics studies.

Conclusion: The CCM liquid argon detector represents a significant advancement in the search for MeV-scale neutrinos and other beyond Standard Model physics signals. By utilizing light-based detection and incorporating detailed simulations and PMT characterization, the detector minimizes the stringent requirements on LAr purity. The achieved results in modeling photon propagation in complex media open new possibilities for high-sensitivity neutrino experiments without the need for ultra-pure LAr, thus broadening the scope of affordable and effective particle physics experiments.

Abstract: The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light
collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model
physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument
the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light
produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements
of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV
particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with
O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr
light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from
a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this
high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical
photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This
result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to
scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first
description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including:
anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance,
Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.

Result: the new calibration strategy reduces the bias in muon charge estimation, leading to more accurate muon counts, validated through data collected from 2019 to 2024.

Conclusion: implementing this new calibration approach improves the accuracy of underground muon detectors, enhancing the observatory's ability to study high-energy cosmic particles.

Abstract: The Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory features a
calorimetric detection mode that estimates the number of muons based on signal
charge measurements. This contribution provides an overview of the calibration
procedure, revisiting the previously published strategy and identifying a bias
introduced by the triggers used to estimate the mean charge deposited by a
vertical muon. We demonstrate that calibrating underground detectors requires
careful consideration of the interactions of penetrating particles through
matter. In devices based on plastic scintillators, energy deposition, and thus
the recorded charge, is significantly affected by knock-on electron production
in the surrounding ground as muons traverse the medium. To mitigate this
effect, we propose a new calibration strategy that ensures an unbiased muon
estimator. This approach is applied to data collected from 2019 to 2024.

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据驱动的响应学习显著改善了 HPGe 探测器的 pulse shape 模拟，有助于更准确地进行数据分析与探测器校准。

Abstract: High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors are a key technology for rare-event
searches such as neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and dark
matter experiments. Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction
topology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse
shape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that
distinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable
simulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of
first-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics,
requiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to
accurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic
Positional U-Net (CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so
that they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative
Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this Response Emulation Network (REN)
learns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high
fidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a
High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact
(ICPC) geometry to show that CPU-Net effectively captures and reproduces
critical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without
detector-specific tuning. CPU-Net achieves up to a factor-of-four improvement
in distribution-level agreement for pulse shape parameter reconstruction, while
preserving the topology-dependent information required for pulse-shape
discrimination.

Abstract: As an auxiliary system within the calibration system of the Jiangmen
Underground Neutrino Observatory, a calibration house is designed to provide
interfaces for connecting the central detector and accommodating various
calibration sub-systems. Onsite installation has demonstrated that the
calibration house interfaces are capable of effectively connecting to the
central detector and supporting the installation of complex and sophisticated
calibration sub-systems. Additionally, controlling the levels of radon and
oxygen within the calibration house is critical. Radon can increase the
experimental background, while oxygen can degrade the quality of the liquid
scintillator. The oxygen concentration can be maintained at levels below 10
parts per million, and the radon concentration can be kept below 15
mBq/m$^{3}$. This paper will provide detailed information on the calibration

TL;DR: The study explores the potential of using CsI cryogenic crystals in TBPET scanners to reduce costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the high cost of PET scanner systems, offering a solution by using cheaper CsI crystals.

Method: The study evaluates performance metrics such as light output, energy, spatial, and coincidence resolution using CsI crystals.

Result: The results show high performance (≥1e5 photons/MeV, <7% energy resolution, mm spatial resolution, ns coincidence time resolution), suggesting cost-efficient TBPET scanners.

Conclusion: The research indicates that cryogenic CsI crystals could make high-performance PET scanners more accessible and affordable.

Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to
significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive
dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption
is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. In
this context, pure cesium iodide (CsI) monolithic crystals, given their much
lower cost compared with currently used rare-earth crystals, offer a promising
solution to improve accessibility. When operated at cryogenic temperatures
(approximately 100 K), CsI crystals exhibit one of the highest light outputs
among inorganic crystals, around $10^5$ photons/MeV. This results in energy
resolution below 7%, millimeter-scale spatial resolution (including accurate
depth-of-interaction determination), and coincidence time resolution at the
nanosecond level, despite their relatively slow scintillation decay time. This
study demonstrates that a TBPET scanner based on cryogenic CsI monolithic
crystals might have the potential to deliver high-performance imaging at a
reduced cost compared with conventional systems, paving the way for broader
deployment and accessibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation:  advancement of cosmic-ray muon applications in border security, particularly through the EU funded project SilentBorder, leading researchers to optimize muon tomography systems for better performance in detecting hidden materials.

Key points: The goal is enhancing imaging and detection accuracy through advanced computational tools and simulations.
The optimization methods include TomOpt and GEANT4, each offering different strengths in handling computational challenges and improving system performance.
By combining these methods, the study aims to provide a comprehensive approach to optimizing the muon tomography system.
Finally, the results demonstrate significant improvements in the system's efficiency and effectiveness in practical border security applications.

Method: Two optimization strategies are employed: one using TomOpt, a Python-based tool that employs differentiable programming and Bayesian optimization to handle noisy objective functions, particularly in image reconstruction tasks. The second strategy leverages GEANT4-based simulations for detailed physical modeling and to study the impact of incorporating secondary particle information, enhancing material discrimination.

Result: The integration of these optimization methods leads to improved system performance. TomOpt with Bayesian optimization enhances the handling of noisy data and improves reconstruction accuracy, while GEANT4 simulations provide high-fidelity modeling to study secondary particle effects, which further boost the system's accuracy in material detection.

Conclusion: This research advances the field of muon tomography by demonstrating effective optimization strategies that combine TomOpt and GEANT4, leading to enhanced capabilities in border security applications for detecting hidden materials.

Abstract: The past several decades have seen significant advancement in applications
using cosmic-ray muons for tomography scanning of unknown objects. One of the
most promising developments is the application of this technique in border
security for the inspection of cargo inside trucks and sea containers in order
to search for hazardous and illicit hidden materials. This work focuses on the
optimization studies for a muon tomography system similar to that being
developed within the framework of the `SilentBorder' project funded by the EU
Horizon 2020 scheme. Current studies are directed toward optimizing the
detector module design, following two complementary approaches. The first
leverages TomOpt, a Python-based end-to-end software that employs
differentiable programming to optimize scattering tomography detector
configurations. While TomOpt inherently supports gradient-based optimization, a
Bayesian Optimization module is introduced to better handle scenarios with
noisy objective functions, particularly in image reconstruction-driven
optimization tasks. The second optimization strategy relies on detailed
GEANT4-based simulations, which, while more computationally intensive, offer
higher physical fidelity. These simulations are also employed to study the
impact of incorporating secondary particle information alongside cosmic muons
for improved material discrimination. This paper presents the current status
and results obtained from these optimization studies.

Abstract: A barrel-shaped plastic scintillation counter with Multi-Pixel Photon Counter
(MPPC) readout has been developed and operated in the first WASA-FRS
experimental campaign at GSI. The detector was used to measure charged
particles emitted from reactions induced by a 2.5 GeV proton beam incident on a
carbon target, providing particle identification in combination with momentum
reconstruction in a 1 T magnetic field. The performance of this detector,
particularly its response to energy deposition and time resolution, was
systematically investigated as a function of count rate and total number of
irradiating protons. A time resolution of 45-75 ps ($\sigma$), depending on the
energy deposition, was achieved. Stable performance was maintained under
high-rate conditions up to 1.35 MHz per single counter, with no significant
degradation in either signal amplitude or timing response. Radiation-induced
damage to the MPPCs was observed primarily as a reduction in signal amplitude,
with approximately $35\%$ decrease at an estimated 1 MeV neutron-equivalent
fluence of $2.4 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$.

Motivation: 理解Th-229m在外层电子态下的跃迁衰变机制，尤其是在不同化学状态下的半衰期差异，以便更好地解释物性与电子结构的关系。

Method: 采用DFT计算，分别研究CaF2、MgF2和LiSrAlF6离子陷阱中的Th在外层电子态下的衰变途径。

Result: 不同外层电子态条件下Th-229m的主要衰变途径和半衰期表现出显著差异，LiSrAlF6可能通过γ跃迁、内部转换和电子桥等多种路径衰变，而CaF2和MgF2主要通过γ跃迁。

Conclusion: 结果表明外层电子态对Th-229m的γ射线跃迁衰变机制有重要影响，实验结果与理论预测一致，进一步确认了不同外层电子态对放射性特性的重要影响。

Abstract: The excitation energy of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ is extremely low at $ 8.4
\, \mathrm{eV} $; thus, this isotope exhibits changes in its decay modes
depending on the chemical state, specifically the outermost electronic states.
However, the reported half-lives of $ \gamma $-ray transition are not
consistent among the previous experiments. In this study, we investigate the
chemical states of $ {}^{229m} \mathrm{Th} $ by DFT calculations. Based on
these results, we evaluate the relationship between the experimental half-life
for each sample and the electronic state of $ \mathrm{Th} $. The calculation
results indicate that ion trap method, $ \mathrm{Ca} \mathrm{F}_2 $ model and $
\mathrm{Mg} \mathrm{F}_2 $ one decay only via the $ \gamma $-ray transition,
whereas $ \mathrm{Li} \mathrm{Sr} \mathrm{Al} \mathrm{F}_6 $ decay via the $

Abstract: High-sensitivity laser spectroscopy is integral to applications like atomic
clocks, quantum computers, and chemical sensing. Lowering atomic temperature
decreases spectral Doppler broadening and increases transit time across the
excitation laser. We find that a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coated surface can
cool iron atoms from ~1400 K to room temperature by surface scattering. It is
also apparent that a single scattering event is enough for atoms to equilibrate
with the PDMS surface temperature. Further, we show the very low adsorption of
iron and ytterbium atoms on PDMS, an effect that persists to surface
temperatures of 200 K. Through numerical simulation, we demonstrate the
potential use of surface scattering in making a room temperature source of
collimated atoms with enhanced flux and reduced velocity compared to that
without surface scattering.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a central characterization
method for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting NMR spectra to
deduce molecular structures remains challenging due to the complexity of
spectral data and the vastness of the chemical space. In this work, we
introduce DiffNMR, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages a conditional
discrete diffusion model for de novo molecular structure elucidation from NMR
spectra. DiffNMR refines molecular graphs iteratively through a diffusion-based
generative process, ensuring global consistency and mitigating error
accumulation inherent in autoregressive methods. The framework integrates a
two-stage pretraining strategy that aligns spectral and molecular
representations via diffusion autoencoder (Diff-AE) and contrastive learning,
the incorporation of retrieval initialization and similarity filtering during
inference, and a specialized NMR encoder with radial basis function (RBF)
encoding for chemical shifts, preserving continuity and chemical correlation.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffNMR achieves competitive performance
for NMR-based structure elucidation, offering an efficient and robust solution
for automated molecular analysis.

Abstract: The gas-phase hydrogen exchange reaction (HER) is the most fundamental
chemical process for benchmarking quantum reaction dynamics. In this Letter, we
focus on controlling HER by means of strong light-matter coupling inside a
resonant cavity, an approach often called polariton chemistry. In particular,
we focus on the isotopic variation of HER involving collisions between
molecular hydrogen H$_2$ and deuterium atom D, i.e., H$_2$+D$\to$HD+H. We find
that the asymmetry introduced by the different isotopes, despite being small,
enables strong cavity-induced modifications of reaction rates. Outside of the
cavity the reaction is as usual D+H${_2}$$\to$DH+H. However, inside the cavity
another type of reactions take place where D+H$_2$$\to$DH+H+E$_{photon}$, where
E$_{photon}$=$\hbar\omega_{cav}$. Our results show that HER is an ideal
platform to make a significant step toward closing the gap between theory and
experiment in polariton chemistry.

order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) with Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary
(BvK) conditions. The approach is based on well-localised Wannier functions in
a LCAO formalism and extends the molecular DLPNO-MP2 implementation Tubromole
program package to periodic systems. The PNOs are formed through a PAO-OSV-PNO
cascade, using BvK projected atomic orbitals and orbital specific virtuals as
intermediaries in an analogous manner to the molecular scheme. Our chargeless
and surface-dipole corrected local density fitting approach is shown to be
numerically stable and to ensure convergent lattice summations over the
periodic images for the two- and three-index Coulomb integrals. Through careful
benchmarking, we show that the DLPNO approximations in the BvK-DLPNO-MP2
methods are entirely consistent with those of molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations,
and with an alternative periodic approach Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, reported in Paper
II of this series. Smooth convergence to the canonical correlation energy with
tightening PNO threshold is observed. Reference MP2 correlation energies are
provided for a set of 2D and 3D periodic systems using a triple-zeta basis and
supercell sizes up to 11$\times$11 and 7$\times$7$\times$7.

Abstract: We present a domain-based local pair natural orbital M{\o}ller--Plesset
second order perturbation theory (DLPNO-MP2) for periodic systems, working
within an LCAO formalism within the Tubromole program package. This approach,
Megacell-DLPNO-MP2, embeds a supercell correlation treatment within a megacell
and does not involve periodic image summation for the Coulomb integrals.
Working in a basis of well-localised Wannier functions, periodicity is instead
imposed through rigorous translational symmetry of Hamiltonian integrals and
wavefunction parameters. The accuracy of the method is validated through
comparison with a complementary periodic DLPNO-MP2 method that employs
Born--von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary conditions, described in paper I of this
series. The PNO approximations are shown to be equivalent in the two approaches
and entirely consistent with molecular DLPNO-MP2 calculations. The
Megacell-DLPNO-MP2 method displays sub-linear scaling with respect to supercell
size at the asymptotic limit and example calculations are presented with up to
15000 basis functions in the correlation treatment.

Motivation: Analyzing a paper on a smart sports system using nanogenerators as energy harvesters and sensors. The focus is on the development and performance of a polymer-based triboelectric nanogenerator for real-time monitoring in sports. The paper also explores potential applications in health and performance evaluation.

Method: The research employs a combination of experimental and simulation methods to evaluate the properties of the SG-TENG and its integration into sports footwear.

Result: The study demonstrates that the SG-TENG has high energy harvesting efficiency, real-time sensing capabilities, and potential applications in non-invasive health monitoring and performance tracking. The results show that the device can distinguish between different gait patterns and monitor physiological states.

Conclusion: The development of this triboelectric nanogenerator opens up new possibilities for integrating advanced materials and devices into wearable sports technology, enhancing the performance evaluation and health monitoring in athletes.

Abstract: Wearable sensors are critical components in smart sports systems for
real-time monitoring of athletic performance, physiological conditions, and
psychological states. In this work, a sodium alginate/gelatin-based
triboelectric nanogenerator (SG-TENG) was developed for mechanical energy
harvesting and real-time sensing in track and field applications. The
SA/gelatin composite film exhibits high transparency, good flexibility, and
uniform morphology, enabling stable triboelectric output. The SG-TENG delivers
high electrical performance, including an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 156.6
V, short-circuit current (Isc) of 46.9 uA, and transferred charge (Qsc) of
139.6 nC, with a maximum power of 13.5 mW under optimal loading. Its output
characteristics are closely related to mechanical parameters such as frequency,
force, displacement, and contact area. Furthermore, the device demonstrates
energy storage capability by charging capacitors under various dynamic
conditions. Integrated into a running shoe, the SG-TENG enables self-powered
gait monitoring and can distinguish between walking, running, and jumping. It
also shows potential for inferring psychological and physiological states from
gait features, offering a promising solution for battery-free, multifunctional
sensing in sports performance evaluation and health monitoring.

*Eric W. Fischer*

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces CBO-CC theory with cavity-modified electron correlation in the vibrational strong coupling regime, combining CRP and CC methods to develop CRP-CCSD, and using linearization schemes like lCRP-CCSD for efficiency. They compare various methods and find that lCRP-CCSD works well, highlighting the complexity of electron correlation under strong coupling and initiating further work beyond mean-field theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses electron correlation in vibrational strong coupling, a challenging regime in computational chemistry, seeking accurate methods without excessive computational cost.

Method: Cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster (CBO-CC) theory combined with cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach and Lagrangian formulation of CC. They derive CRP-CCSD, employ linearization schemes like lCRP-CCSD for computational efficiency, and use hierarchy of approximations.

Result: In several test cases, lCRP-CCSD methods outperform CRP-CCSD, especially in the few-molecule limit. Results show significant differences between mean-field and correlated methods in reactive and collective scenarios, indicating the non-trivial nature of electron correlation.

Conclusion: The work presents a methodological framework for studying cavity-modified electron correlation with improved computational efficiency, contributing to understanding and modeling microsolvation and vibro-polaritonic effects in ab initio chemistry.

Abstract: We present a detailed derivation and discussion of cavity Born-Oppenheimer
coupled cluster (CBO-CC) theory and address cavity-modified electron
correlation in the vibrational strong coupling regime. Methodologically, we
combine the recently proposed cavity reaction potential (CRP) approach with the
Lagrangian formulation of CC theory and derive a self-consistent CRP-CC method
at the singles and doubles excitations level (CRP-CCSD). The CRP-CC approach is
formally similar to implicit solvation CC models and provides access to the
CBO-CC electronic ground state energy minimized in cavity coordinate space on a
CC level of theory. A hierarchy of linearisation schemes (lCRP-CCSD) similar to
canonical CC theory systematically lifts the self-consistent nature of the
CRP-CCSD approach and mitigates numerical cost by approximating electron
correlation effects in energy minimization. We provide a thorough comparison of
CRP-CCSD, lCRP-CCSD and CRP-Hartee-Fock methods for a cavity-modified
Menshutkin reaction, pyridine$+$CH$_3$Br, and cavity-induced collective
electronic effects in microsolvation energies of selected methanol-water
clusters. We find lCRP-CCSD methods to provide excellent results compared to
the self-consistent CRP-CCSD approach in the few-molecule limit. We furthermore
observe significant differences between mean-field and correlated results in
both reactive and collective scenarios. Our work emphasizes the non-trivial
character of electron correlation under vibrational strong coupling and
provides a starting point for further developments in ab initio
vibro-polaritonic chemistry beyond the mean-field approximation.

Abstract: Understanding the structure and thermodynamics of solvated ions is essential
for advancing applications in electrochemistry, water treatment, and energy
storage. While ab initio molecular dynamics methods are highly accurate, they
are limited by short accessible time and length scales whereas classical force
fields struggle with accuracy. Herein, we explore the structure and
thermodynamics of complex monovalent-divalent ion pairs using Na2SO4(aq) as a
case study by applying a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) trained
on density functional theory (DFT) data. Our MLIP-based approach reproduces key
bulk properties such as density and radial distribution functions of water. We
provide the hydration structure of the sodium and sulfate ions in 0.1-2 M
concentration range and the one-dimensional and two-dimensional potentials of
mean force for the sodium-sulfate ion pairing at the low concentration limit
(0.1 M) which are inaccessible to DFT. At low concentrations, the sulfate ion
is strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion
pairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that
coordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby
the sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially. We demonstrate that
MLIPs allow the study of solvated ions beyond simple monovalent pairs with
DFT-level accuracy in their low concentration limit (0.1 M) via statistically
converged properties from ns long simulations.

Main category: physics.chem-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces TS-GEN, a generative model that predicts transition state structures with high accuracy and speed, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of experimentally identifying transition states, which are transient and difficult to observe. The authors propose using a machine learning model to overcome the limitations of traditional methods that rely on computationally expensive simulations.

Method: The method involves a conditional flow-matching generative model that maps from a Gaussian prior to TS geometries. It conditions on reactant and product conformations and uses optimal transport paths to generate accurate TS structures, bypassing traditional iterative optimization algorithms.

Result: TS-GEN achieves a root-mean-square deviation of 0.004 Å and a mean barrier error of 1.019 kcal/mol, which are significantly better than prior methods. It also runs faster (0.06 s per inference) and has high transferability across various reactions.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel and efficient approach to modeling transition states, which will greatly enhance high-throughput chemical exploration and the search for new reaction mechanisms.

Abstract: Transition state (TS) structures define the critical geometries and energy
barriers underlying chemical reactivity, yet their fleeting nature renders them
experimentally elusive and drives the reliance on costly, high-throughput
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a
conditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple
Gaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a
single, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product
conformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent
noise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively
replacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or
string-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a
root-mean-square deviation of $0.004\ \rm{\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\
\rm{\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error
of $1.019\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\ {\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only
$0.06\ {\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet
chemical-accuracy criteria ($<1.58\ {\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially
outpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to
out-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom
precision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly
useful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the
way to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.

Abstract: High-dimensional photonic states have significantly advanced the fundamentals
and applications of light. However, it remains huge challenges to quantify
arbitrary states in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces with spin and orbital
angular momentum bases. Here we introduce a geometric method to quantify
arbitrary states in a 4D Hilbert space by interferometrically mapping them to
unified centroid ellipses. Specifically, nine Stokes parameters can be deduced
from three ellipses to quantify the 4D spin-orbit states described by SU(4)
Poincar\'e hypersphere. We verify its feasibility by detecting these spin-orbit
states gotten by both free-space wave plates and few-mode fibers. For the first
time, we completely quantify and reconstruct higher-order modal group evolution
of a weakly guiding few-mode fiber under twist perturbation. This geometric
quantification, beyond the classical Stokes polarimetry, may pave the way to
multi-dimensional optical metrology, sensing, and high-dimensional classical or
quantum communications.

Conclusion: 提供全新的多孤子操控方案，适用于通信和测量。

Abstract: The optical Kerr micro-ring provides an ideal platform for the study of
dissipative optical solitons. Dissipative solitons are localized waves produced
by a precise equilibrium between dispersion and nonlinearity, as well as gain
and loss. Dissipative brilliant solitons are vulnerable to external noise,but
dissipative dark solitons exhibit greater robustness against noise and losses.
This study discusses the division of the input pump light field into transverse
electric (TE) and transverse magnetic(TM) modes. TE mode generates bright
solitons. TM mode forms dark solitons via cross-phase modulation (XPM), which
induces a self-focusing effect. The bright and dark solitons bind into a
soliton molecule pair through mutual interactions. We scan the entire detuning
interval; within the positive small detuning interval, two modes simultaneously
generate bright-dark soliton pair Turing roll states. Within the larger
detuning interval, the excited Brillouin scattering noise induces a high
suppression ratio (SR) between the dark and bright soliton pumps, which is
unfavorable for the formation of the bright-dark soliton pair. The system
provides a new multi-soliton manipulation scheme for optical communications.
The soliton molecule pairs hold major implications for high precision
measurement and all-optical controlling fields.

Abstract: How can one design complex systems capable of learning for a given
functionality? In the context of ultrafast laser-surface interaction, we
unravel the nature of learning schemes tied to the emergence of complexity in
dissipative structures. The progressive development of learning mechanisms,
from direct information storage to the development of smart surfaces,
originates from the network of curvatures formed in the unstable fluid under
thermoconvective instability, which is subsequently quenched and resolidified.
Under pulsed laser irradiation, non-equilibrium dynamics generate intricate
nanoscale patterns, unveiling adaptive process mechanisms. We demonstrate that
the imprints left by light act as a form of structural memory, encoding not
only local effects directed by laser field polarization but also a cooperative
strategy of reliefs that dynamically adjust surface morphology to optimize
light capture. By investigating how apparent complexity and optical response
are intricately intertwined, shaping one another, we establish a framework that
draws parallels between material adaptation and learning dynamics observed in
biological systems.

Motivation: The need for low-cost, portable, and multiplexed fluorescence-based Point-of-Care diagnostics driving the search for compact, scalable sensors.

Method: Developed a quantum light source on TFLN using type-I phase matching, achieving continuous tunability over a wide wavelength range with high efficiency.

Result: Achieved an on-chip efficiency comparable to bulk sources, with a tunable range over one octave.

Conclusion: This platform enables high-performance on-chip photonic and multiplexed sensing for medical diagnostics and beyond.

Abstract: Compact, scalable, and multiplexed fluorescence lifetime sensors are of great
interest for point-of-care diagnostics. However, current solutions either lack
broad-range wavelength-tuning capabilities or involve complex optical setups
that hinder miniaturization. On-chip entangled photon sources offer a promising
alternative for time-resolved spectroscopy with their strong temporal
correlations, tunable spectral characteristics, and small footprints. Here, we
develop a temperature-tunable, visible quantum light source on thin-film
lithium niobate (TFLN) with a continuous tuning range greater than one octave,
spanning 564.5~nm to 1.494~$\mu$m using only one waveguide. The tunability is
enabled by utilizing type-I phase matching. We measured an on-chip efficiency
of \boldmath$(3.88\pm0.20)\times10^{9}$ pairs/s/mW, comparable to the most
efficient type-0 bulk lithium niobate sources. These results show that the TFLN
platform is ideal for on-chip integrated photonic and multiplexed lifetime
imaging and sensing.

Abstract: Solid-state high-order harmonic generation (HHG) presents unique features
different from gases.Whereas the gaseous harmonics driven by counter-rotating
bicircular (CRB) pulse universally peak at a "magic" field ratio approximately
E_2{\omega}:E_{\omega}=1.5:1, crystals exhibit significant material-dependent
responses. In monolayer MoS2, the harmonic yield experiences two maxima at the
gas-like 1.5:1 ratio, and again in the single-color limit, whereas monolayer
hBN shows a monotonic increase as the 2{\omega} component dominates. Combining
time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and a minimal real-space
trajectory analysis, we show that these differences arise from the interplay of
Bloch velocity and anomalous Hall velocity. The trajectory model quantitatively
reproduces the ab-initio results, and offers an intuitive prediction of the
harmonics yield without further heavy computation. These insights provide
practical guidance for tailoring solid-state HHG and for selecting 2D compounds
with desirable responses.

Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is one of the key concepts of
condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders.
However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence
of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose
that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a detection of multipolar
anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic tight-binding
calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and
time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman
optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking.
Furthermore, we find that the Stokes and anti-Stokes spectra encode the
time-reversal parity of the multipolar order, providing an all-optical means to
distinguish multipolar phases. Our findings open a pathway for identifying
multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy
as a sensitive and versatile probe.

Result: The EFISH effect enables SHG in centrosymmetric materials, offering tunable nonlinear optical devices and applications across various frequency regimes.

Conclusion: The EFISH effect is a promising method for overcoming the centrosymmetric material limitation for SHG, facilitating advancements in photonic and nonlinear optical technologies.

Abstract: Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental nonlinear optical process
widely used in photonics; however, it is strictly forbidden in the bulk of
centrosymmetric materials due to their inversion symmetry. Nevertheless,
applying an external electric field breaks this inversion symmetry. It induces
an effective second-order nonlinear response known as the
electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation (EFISH) effect. This
mechanism enables SHG even in centrosymmetric media and provides a powerful
tool for dynamic and electrically tunable nonlinear nanophotonics. This review
presents a comprehensive overview of the EFISH effect, covering the
fundamentals, various material platforms (including bulk semiconductor
crystals, ferroelectrics, van der Waals materials, and polymers), as well as
diverse strategies for electric field engineering. It further distinguishs
EFISH from related effects such as current-induced SHG and the quantum-confined
Stark effect, and highlight emerging applications of EFISH in tunable photonic
devices, carrier dynamics probing, and nonlinear optical modulation across
optical, electronic, and THz regimes. Finally, key challenges and perspectives
for the future development of electrically controlled nonlinear optical systems
are outlined.

Abstract: Electromagnetic materials with a uniaxial effective permittivity tensor,
characterized by its transverse ($\epsilon_\perp$) and axial
($\epsilon_\parallel$) components, play a central role in the design of
advanced photonic and electromagnetic materials including hyperbolic
metamaterials, and biological imaging platforms. Tight bounds on the complex
effective permittivity of such metamaterials are critical for predicting and
optimizing their macroscopic electromagnetic response. While rigorous tight
bounds exist for isotropic two-phase composites, corresponding results for
uniaxial composites remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we
systematically investigate the attainable range of $\epsilon_\perp$ and
$\epsilon_\parallel$ in the quasistatic regime for two-phase metamaterials with
isotropic homogeneous phases. By analyzing known microgeometries and
constructing hierarchical laminates (HLs), we demonstrate that the classical
bounds on $\epsilon_\perp$ are not optimal. We conjecture improved bounds based
on numerically fitted circular arcs derived from convex hulls of
$\epsilon_\perp$ values obtained from HLs, and we identify optimal rank-4 HL
structures that achieve all points on the conjectured bounds. Additionally, we
quantify the correlation between $\epsilon_\perp$ and $\epsilon_\parallel$ for
fixed volume fractions, and propose a design algorithm to construct HL
microstructures achieving prescribed values of $\epsilon_\perp$. Leveraging the
Cherkaev-Gibiansky transformation and the translation method, we extend recent
techniques developed for isotropic composites by Kern-Miller-Milton to derive
translation bounds on the uniaxial complex effective permittivity tensor.
Finally, bounds on the sensitivity of the effective permittivity tensor of
low-loss composites are obtained and their optimality is shown in
two-dimensions.

TL;DR: The study identifies new mechanisms for the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) in noncoplanar antiferromagnets without relying on spin-orbit coupling or magnetization, establishing a new platform for opto-spintronic applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research advances understanding of MOKE mechanisms, which has implications for spintronic devices, offering new possibilities for ultrafast and immune applications.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experimental verification using a Sagnac interferometer microscope to observe scalar spin chirality in Co1/3TaS2.

Result: Large MOKE observed in noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 without SOC or net magnetization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a new MOKE mechanism and opens doors for opto-spintronic applications using chiral spin textures in compensated systems.

Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), the differential reflection of
oppositely circularly polarized light, has traditionally been associated with
relativistic spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which links a particle's spin with its
orbital motion. In ferromagnets, large MOKE signals arise from the combination
of magnetization and SOC, while in certain coplanar antiferromagnets,
SOC-induced Berry curvature enables MOKE despite zero net magnetization.
Theoretically, large MOKE can also arise in a broader class of magnetic
materials with compensated spins, without relying on SOC - for example, in
systems exhibiting real-space scalar spin chirality. The experimental
verification has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate such a SOC- and
magnetization-free MOKE in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2. Using a
Sagnac interferometer microscope, we image domains of scalar spin chirality and
their reversal. Our findings establish experimentally a new mechanism for
generating large MOKE signals and position chiral spin textures in compensated
magnets as a compelling platform for ultrafast, stray-field-immune
opto-spintronic applications.

Abstract: We introduce a quasi-phase-matched technique in quadratic nonlinear crystals,
constructing an artificial gauge field by changing the inclination angle of
stripes, which is realized by the positive and negative polarization directions
of nonlinear susceptibility along the crystal. Unlike the artificial gauge
field constructed through linear coupling in other settings, the gauge field in
this system is realized by nonlinear coupling. We demonstrate that this gauge
field can generate stable chiral solitons with chiral energy flow rotating
around the solitons. In contrast to conventional chiral currents generated with
the same specie or frequency, the chiral currents in the present system are
formed by mutual coupling between fundamental frequency and second harmonic
components. We derive the semi-analytical solution for the chiral energy flow
in this system. It is found that there exists an optimal inclination angle that
can maximize the chiral energy flow under different parameters, and this
optimal inclination shows a positive correlation with the power and detuning.
The mobility and collisions of the chiral solitons are also discussed. The
results show that chiral solitons move in response to kicking and undergo fully
elastic collisions with each other. In addition, the possibility of
experimentally generating chiral solitons and chiral currents is outlined.

Abstract: This work developed an accurate and robust absorption-based method for
spatially resolved measurements of gas temperatures in flames and reacting
flows, with typical single-measurement uncertainties on the order of 1\%. This
method exploits narrow-linewidth laser absorption of hot CO$_2$ molecules,
which can be generated from combustion or artificially seeded into the flow. A
collinear dual-laser setup allowed for periodic scans over tens of CO$_2$
absorption transitions near the $\nu_3$ bandhead every 100 $\mu s$, from which
gas temperatures (as well as CO$_2$ concentrations) were determined with high
sensitivity and robustness. Spatially resolved measurements were achieved using
an electrically driven high-speed beam scanning system consisting of a 2-D
galvo scanner and a pair of off-axis parabolic mirrors. An effective spatial
resolution of 1 mm was achieved at a planar field measurement speed of 200 Hz
and a volumetric field measurement speed of 2 Hz, with further improvements in
speed anticipated by another order of magnitude. A physically constrained
nonlinear inference framework was also developed for the quantitative analysis
of the measurement data. Proof-of-concept experiments were performed on
axisymmetric flames stabilized on a Mckenna burner at various equivalence
ratios and flow rates, and the results agreed asymptotically with the
theoretical value of the adiabatic flame temperature. An additional experiment
on a flame of complex geometry demonstrated an excellent level of resolution,
precision, and contrast achieved by the current thermometry method. This method
promises to provide good utility in future combustion studies due to its high
performance metrics and relative ease of use.

TL;DR: The paper presents PANORAMA, a single-shot re-imaging microscope that achieves high resolution imaging over a large field of view, handling non-flat surfaces without mechanical scanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for efficient and high-resolution microscopy solutions in biomedical and materials science, especially for large samples that are often non-flat, making traditional microscopy techniques inefficient.

Method: PANORAMA uses a telecentric photolithography lens, a large-aperture tube lens, and a flat camera array with adaptive focus control to maintain submicron focus across various surfaces. It enables single-shot imaging without mechanical scanning, increasing throughput.

Result: The microscope successfully captured gigapixel images at 0.84um resolution over a large 16.3x18.8mm² field of view, handling flat, curved, or uneven samples efficiently.

Conclusion: PANORAMA significantly advances large-area microscopy by combining high resolution with flexibility and throughput, expanding applications in imaging.

Abstract: Large-area microscopy with submicron resolution is limited by tradeoffs
between field of view (FOV), resolution, and imaging speed. Samples are rarely
flat across centimeter-scale FOV, which often requires existing solutions to
use mechanical scanning to ensure focused capture at reduced throughput. Here,
we present PANORAMA, a single-shot, re-imaging microscope that achieves
seamless, gigapixel imaging over a 16.3$\times$18.8 $\text{mm}^2$ FOV at 0.84
um resolution without mechanical scanning. By using a telecentric
photolithography lens, a large-aperture tube lens, and a flat micro-camera
array with adaptive per-camera focus control, PANORAMA maintains submicron
focus across flat, curved or uneven samples that span centimeters. This
approach improves imaging throughput and adaptability, enabling gigapixel
multi-modal microscopy of large flat and non-flat samples in one shot, thus
broadening its applications in biomedical and materials imaging.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that inkjet-printed LC droplets can be engineered to generate structured light, utilizing their birefringence for beam generation. They create three droplet types for specific beam features, achieving skyrmions, polarized fields, and polarization singularities with orbital angular momentum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper's motivation is to explore LC droplet photonic functionality by leveraging their anisotropy, moving beyond their typical use as microlenses. They aim to harness the birefringence for advanced optical beam generation.

Method: The LC droplets are designed with different alignment layers and chiral pitches to control their director configurations. They print LC layers with tailored director orientations to produce unique birefringence distributions, which then generate specific structured light beams.

Result: The method successfully produces beams with skyrmionic structures, azimuthal or radial polarization, and singularities. These beams carry orbital angular momentum, showing the potential for novel optical manipulation applications.

Conclusion: This work opens new possibilities in LC droplet photonic applications, expanding their potential in optical beam engineering and manipulation.

Abstract: Inkjet-printed liquid crystal (LC) droplets exhibit an intricate
spatially-varying birefringence due to their complex internal director
configuration. While such anisotropy is often viewed as a drawback when LC
droplets are used as microlenses, here we leverage this remarkable
birefringence property to generate complex structured light. Through a
selection of the alignment layer, and by varying the chiral pitch, we create
three distinct droplet types with tailored intrinsic director configurations,
each exhibiting a unique birefringence distribution for structured light beam
generation. We show that these printed LC droplets can generate beams that
exhibit skyrmionic structures carrying two units of orbital angular momentum,
beams that contain azimuthal/radial polarized fields, and beams with
polarization singularities. Our method enables new possibilities for using LC
droplet technology to engineer sophisticated optical beam patterns.

Motivation: The paper addresses the limitations of conventional nanophotonics, which are constrained by fixed optical properties. Quantum materials with correlated electronic and optical properties offer a solution by enabling dynamic control without structural changes. This motivates the exploration of such materials in photonic device design.

Method: The researchers fabricated photonic crystal slabs from CrSBr and used external magnetic fields to tune the properties. They measured the guided resonances, which showed close packing in the spectrum, small mode volumes, high Q-factors, and self-hybridization with excitonic states.

Result: The study achieved unprecedented in situ control, with guided resonances that were highly tunable, had Q-factors over 500, and small mode volumes. The light-matter coupling was intrinsic and strong, suggesting potential for new photonic devices.

Conclusion: The findings highlight quantum materials as a promising alternative for in-situ tunable photonic elements, challenging traditional methods limited by fixed optical properties. Their approach opens new possibilities for nanophotonic design and applications.

Abstract: Central to the field of nanophotonics is the ability to engineer the flow of
light through nanoscale structures. These structures often have permanent
working spectral ranges and optical properties that are fixed during
fabrication. Quantum materials, with their correlated and intertwined degrees
of freedom, offer a promising avenue for dynamically controlling photonic
devices without altering their physical structure. Here, we fabricate photonic
crystal slabs from CrSBr, a van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor, and
demonstrate unprecedented in situ control over their optical properties.
Leveraging the combination of the exceptionally large refractive index of CrSBr
near its excitonic resonances and its tunability via external fields, we
achieve precise manipulation of photonic modes at near-visible and infrared
wavelengths, showcasing a new paradigm for nanophotonic device design. The
resulting guided resonances of the photonic crystal are tightly packed in the
spectrum with very small mode volumes, are highly tunable via external magnetic
fields, and exhibit high Q-factors exceeding 500. These resonances
self-hybridize with the excitonic degrees of freedom, resulting in intrinsic
strong light-matter coupling. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum
materials for developing in situ tunable photonic elements and cavities.

Abstract: Distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) based traffic flow monitoring systems
are a cost-effective wide-area traffic monitoring solution that utilize
existing fiber infrastructure along roads. These systems analyse vehicle
vibrations and measure average traffic speeds to detect traffic events.
However, these systems face difficulties in detecting early signs of
non-recurring traffic congestions in low-density traffic flow caused by
presence of single-lane abnormal events. This is because average traffic speeds
do not decrease quickly in such events. During abnormal events, multiple
vehicles perform spontaneous braking and abrupt lane-changes to avoid obstacles
on travel lanes. These vehicle behaviours gradually lead to traffic congestion.
Thus, frequent lane-change maneuver, performed by multiple vehicles at similar
location, may suggest occurrence of congestion-inducing abnormal events. This
paper discusses methods to identify and locate occurrence of these single-lane
abnormal events by detecting frequent lane-change maneuver along road sections.
We first propose a method to locate vehicle positions along a road section and
estimate the vehicle path. We then propose a method to detect vehicle
lane-change maneuver by monitoring variations in spectral centroid of vehicle
vibrations. The evaluation of our proposed methods with real traffic data for
two different expressways showed 81.5% accuracy for individual vehicle path
tracking and 83.5% accuracy in lane-change event detection. These results
suggest that the proposed method has potential for detecting occurrence of
single-lane abnormal events in low-density traffic flow so that necessary
mitigation measures can be initiated before onset of traffic congestions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical tweezers are widely used in measuring parameters of micro and nano scales, which is essential in many scientific fields. However, their application in challenging environments like living cells is hindered by the complexity of particle movements caused by trap structures. This paper attempts to address this problem by demonstrating new phenomena in optical traps, which could enhance the sensitivity of parameter measurements in live cells.

Method: The study used experimental setups with single Gaussian beams to create optical traps. They used polarized illumination to observe different particle behaviors and performed theoretical analysis to understand the observed effects. The model involved higher-order Mie resonances, distinguishing between particles that remain stable and those that exhibit complex motion. They also characterized the motion through trajectory analysis to quantify hopping rates and angular velocities. Additionally, they considered the phase change of VO₂ to assess environmental effects.

Result: The experiments demonstrated that particles larger than λ/3 exhibit bistable and orbiting dynamics under different polarized illuminations, attributed to higher-order Modal resonances. This led to power tunable hopping rates and angular velocities, suggesting potential for enhanced parameter sensitivity. The phase change of VO₂ material influenced the observed behavior, indicating it could be controlled in biological environments.

Conclusion: This research provides a method to achieve complex particle behaviors in simple optical traps using single Gaussian beams. It opens new possibilities for more sensitive measurements of living matter parameters through optical forces, enhancing the applicability of optical tweezers in challenging biological environments.

Abstract: Optical tweezers have become a powerful tool for measuring parameters of
microscale and nanoscale local environments. Motion of particles within optical
tweezer traps established itself as a probe for local viscosity, temperature as
well as external fields. However, complex motions of trapped particles such as
hopping or orbiting conventionally relies on intricate structure of the optical
trap, which creates limitations to their applicability, in particular in
challenging environments such as living matter. Here we demonstrate
experimentally polarization-dependent hopping and orbiting of particles in an
optical trap formed by a single Gaussian beam. This novel effect is observed
for subwavelength particles with sizes above approximately $\lambda/3$, where
$\lambda$ is the wavelength of the trapping beam. Our theoretical analysis
reveals that the hopping and orbiting arises via the excitation of {\it
higher-order Mie resonances}. While smaller particles experiencing dipolar
optical forces remain trapped at the beam center, larger particles experience
quadrupole optical forces exhibiting more complex behavior. Under linearly
polarized illumination, larger particles show {\it bistable dynamics} hopping
between two stable positions. Under circularly polarized illumination, trapped
particles orbit around the beam center, revealing a light-induced
spin-to-orbital angular momentum transfer. Experimental trajectory analysis
reveals power-tunable hopping rates and angular velocities. We discuss the
effect of VO$_2$ monoclinic-to-rutile phase change on the observed effect. Our
results present a robust and reliable way to achieve complex behavior of a
particle in simple single-beam tweezers. This should enhance sensitivity of
parameter measurements for local environments via optical forces, such as
viscosity and temperature inside cells.

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel integration of amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) and silicon nitride (SiN) for advanced photonics applications, offering significant improvements in density, integration, and functionality through heterogenous layers and active devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The traditional silicon nitride (SiN) platform, despite its efficiency and wide industrial use, has limitations in high-density reconfigurable photonics applications such as large minimum bending radii and constrained tunability. The increasing demand for versatile, high-performance photonics platforms has led researchers to seek alternatives or enhancements to address these limitations. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has been identified as a promising candidate due to its high refractive index, optical quality, thermo-optic properties, and strong nonlinear characteristics. However, the integration of a-SiC with SiN for practical photonics applications was not previously achieved, necessitating this research to bridge that gap.

Method: The paper describes a monolithic integration approach combining a-SiC and SiN photonics platforms. The methodology involves co-depositing and layer-by-layer growth to achieve precise a-SiC/SiN heterogenous integration on arbitrary substrates. Active devices were implemented on the a-SiC layer, leveraging its optical and thermal properties. The integration technique ensures on-chip interconnection with minimal loss and optimized device integration density. This approach integrates the best features of both materials onto a single platform, enhancing performance metrics such as integration density and thermo-optic tuning efficiency.

Result: The integrated a-SiC/SiN platform achieved an on-chip interconnection loss of 0.32±0.10 dB, marking a significant reduction in loss. Integration density exceeded 4,444-fold, demonstrating superior material integration efficiency compared to traditional SiN-based systems. The a-SiC layer enabled active device integration with 27 times higher thermo-optic tuning efficiency, offering enhanced dynamic functionality. Additionally, the platform provides flexibility in fiber-to-chip coupling strategies, utilizing efficient side-coupling on SiN and grating-coupling on a-SiC for optimal interface compatibility. These results highlight the potential of the a-SiC/SiN platform in various advanced photonics applications, including programmable and quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and beyond.

Conclusion: The integration of a-SiC and SiN represents a significant breakthrough in photonic platform development. By combining the high performance of a-SiC with the established SiN platform, the a-SiC/SiN hybrid provides a versatile and scalable solution for future photonics challenges. This approach not only addresses the limitations of individual platforms but also opens new possibilities for applications requiring high density, flexibility, and enhanced functionality in integrated photonics.

Abstract: Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) has emerged as a compelling candidate for
applications in integrated photonics, known for its high refractive index, high
optical quality, high thermo-optic coefficient, and strong third-order
nonlinearities. Furthermore, a-SiC can be easily deposited via CMOS-compatible
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, allowing for precise thickness
control and adjustable material properties on arbitrary substrates. Silicon
nitride (SiN) is an industrial well-established and well-matured platform,
which exhibits ultra-low propagation loss, but it is suboptimal for
high-density reconfigurable photonics due to the large minimum bending radius
and constrained tunability. In this work, we monolithically combine a-SiC with
SiN photonics, leveraging the merits of both platforms, and achieve the
a-SiC/SiN heterogeneous integration with an on-chip interconnection loss of
0.32$\pm$0.10 dB, and integration density increment exceeding 4,444-fold. By
implementing active devices on a-SiC, we achieve 27 times higher thermo-optic
tuning efficiency, with respect to the SiN photonic platform. In addition, the
a-SiC/SiN platform gives the flexibility to choose the optimal fiber-to-chip
coupling strategy depending on the interfacing platform, with efficient
side-coupling on SiN and grating-coupling on a-SiC platform. The proposed
a-SiC/SiN photonic platform can foster versatile applications in programmable
and quantum photonics, nonlinear optics, and beyond.

*Yongtao Liu,Tianxiao Wu,Xiao Zhou,Fan Wang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: This paper presents a method combining progressive illumination and deep learning for single-beam super-resolution microscopy, achieving exceptional resolution and SNR. The approach uses nonlinear responses of nanoparticles to vary the PSF and a deep learning model to reconstruct high-resolution images. The reported results include high spatial resolution (33 nm) and a significant improvement in SNR (55 dB to 7 dB). The method could simplify optical systems and enhance imaging quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manuscript introduces a novel microscopy technique that enhances resolution beyond diffraction limits without requiring complex detection systems. The combination of single-beam illumination, nonlinear interactions, and deep learning holds potential for advancing optical microscopy applications across various fields.

Method: The method involves using a doughnut-shaped excitation beam, leveraging the nonlinear responses of upconversion nanoparticles to adjust the point spread function from doughnut to Gaussian. A deep recursive residual network (DRRN) is employed to fuse low and high spatial frequency information for super-resolution image reconstruction.

Result: The researchers achieved a spatial resolution of 33 nm with a 33 times reduction relative to the excitation wavelength and a 14 dB increase in signal-to-noise ratio compared to Gaussian beam illumination. The technique is applicable to different wavelengths.

Conclusion: This method simplifies single-beam super-resolution microscopy systems and opens new possibilities for high-quality, low-cost imaging applications.

Abstract: Single-beam scanning microscopy (SBSM) is one of the most robust strategies
for commercial optical systems. Although structured illumination combined with
Fourier-domain spatial spectrum fusion can enhance SBSM resolution beyond the
diffraction limit, a sophisticated detection system is still required to
optimize both effective resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.Here, we report
that the diverse nonlinear responses of upconversion nanoparticles can unlock a
new mode of Computational Progressively Emission Saturated Nanoscopy (CPSN),
which employs a single doughnut-shaped excitation beam assisted by deep
learning to simplify conventional microscopy. By modulating the excitation
power, the smooth transition of the point spread function (PSF) from
doughnut-shaped to Gaussian can be achieved, allowing for accessing different
spatial frequency components of the sample. Then, in order to enhance time
resolution, the doughnut-shaped beam at low power and the saturated
Gaussian-like image were predicted by the doughnut-shaped beam at low
saturation threshold based on the power dependence curve. Furthermore, a deep
recursive residual network (DRRN) is employed to fusion these progressively
complementary spatial frequency information into a final super-resolved image
that encompasses the full frequency wwinformation. This approach can achieve
high-quality super-resolution imaging with a spatial resolution of 33 nm,
corresponding to 1/29th of the excitation wavelength, 55 dB of SNR ratio
contracted to 7 dB in Gaussian imaging and applicable to any wavelength. The
unique combination of nonlinear saturation and deep learning computational
reconstruction could open a new avenue for simplifying the optical system and
enhancing imaging quality in single-beam super-resolution nanoscopy.

Abstract: Ever since the advent of high-order harmonic generation, one of the main
goals has been to maximize the high harmonic yield. This is due to the wide
range of applications in multidisciplinary research fields, including nonlinear
XUV optics and ultrafast science. Nowadays, intense laser-atom interactions are
one of the primary sources of high-order harmonic generation, emitting
radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) range. Although the scaling laws for
XUV photon numbers have been extensively studied in the past, their dependence
on the duration of the driving laser pulse has remained largely unexplored
experimentally. This is because, in each of these studies, the XUV photon yield
was optimized according to the specific characteristics of the lasers used and
the corresponding XUV beamlines. In other words, there have been no systematic
measurements on the dependence of XUV yield on the duration of the driving
laser pulse. Here, by taking advantage of the SYLOS laser system at ELI ALPS,
we are able to experimentally investigate this long-standing question. We found
that for driving laser field intensities below the saturation threshold of
harmonic generation, the harmonic yield depends linearly on the pulse duration.
However, for laser intensities near to the harmonic yield saturation, the
harmonic yield is inversely proportional to the pulse duration.

Abstract: Electrons in atoms and molecules move on attosecond time scales. Deciphering
their quantum dynamics in space and time calls for high-resolution microscopy
at this speed. While scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) driven with terahertz
pulses has visualized sub-picosecond motion of single atoms, the advent of
attosecond light pulses has provided access to the much faster electron
dynamics. Yet, combining direct atomic spatial and attosecond temporal
resolution remained challenging. Here, we reveal atomic-scale quantum motion of
single electrons in attosecond lightwave-driven STM. Near-infrared single-cycle
waveforms from phase-controlled optical pulse synthesis steer and clock
electron tunnelling. By keeping the thermal load of the tip-sample junction
stable, thereby eliminating thermal artifacts, we detect waveform-dependent
currents on sub-cycle time scales. Our joint theory-experiment campaign shows
that single-cycle near-infrared pulses can drive isolated electronic wave
packets shorter than 1 fs. The angstrom-scale decay of the tunnelling current
earmarks a fascinating interplay of multi-photon and field-driven dynamics. By
balancing these effects, we sharply image a single copper adatom on a silver
surface with lightwave-driven currents. This long-awaited fusion of attosecond
science with atomic-scale STM makes elementary dynamics of electrons inside
atoms, molecules and solids accessible to direct spatio-temporal videography
and atom-scale petahertz electronics.

Abstract: We present a new theory for orbital angular momentum (OAM) generation by
chaotic phase surfaces with discrete integer bias distributions. We derive
fundamental selection rules that determine which OAM modes can be coherently
generated. Our analysis shows that ensemble-averaged OAM exists only when the
bias parameter takes integer values that match the discrete OAM eigenspace,
creating "allowed" and "forbidden" OAM levels. We derive analytical expressions
for the OAM power spectrum and demonstrate universal caling behavior within the
allowed manifold. These theoretical predictions are validated by comprehensive
Monte Carlo simulations, which confirm the selection rules with a
forbidden-level suppression factor exceeding 10^4 and demonstrate the universal
scaling with exceptional accuracy.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for sorting vector vortex beams using a
system of three optical cavities. The method targets the separation of the four
vector vortex modes of a given order m by exploiting their symmetry properties
with respect to radial axes. The first cavity separates the modes into two
pairs, one symmetric and one antisymmetric under horizontal flip, by
transmitting one pair and reflecting the other. Each output is then directed
into a second cavity, which further resolves the pairs into individual modes
based on their parity. A key element between the cavities is a novel system
introduced in this work, the Profile Rotator (PR), which rigidly rotates the
beam profile (including its polarization structure) using an appropriately
calibrated K-mirror and a Faraday rotator. The theoretical framework is based
on the analysis of mode symmetries and their interaction with cavity boundary
conditions. This work lays the groundwork for experimental implementations of
efficient mode sorting, with potential applications in high-dimensional quantum
information processing, optical communications, and structured light
manipulation.

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel chiral infrared optical cavity made from planar mirrors with silver helices to achieve high enantioselectivity and all-optical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the limitation of molecular chiroptical responses in all-optical applications, such as enantio-selective sorting of chiral molecules and biasing chiral reactions.

Method: The cavity is constructed using diffracting lattices of silver helices, which provide electromagnetic chirality. The planar mirrors enhance helicity selectivity and preserve helicity at large incidence angles.

Result: The cavity achieves a 95% dissymmetry in the modes with zero in-plane momentum, showing significant helicity selectivity and making it a good candidate for enantio-selective applications.

Conclusion: The proposed cavity design effectively solves the issue of dissymmetry in chiral optical cavities for all-optical applications, utilizing the properties of helices and planar mirrors.

Abstract: The infamous weakness of molecular chiroptical responses challenges the
all-optical realization of crucial applications such as enantio-selective
sorting of chiral molecules, or biasing chiral chemical reactions. Chiral
optical cavities are a natural choice for confronting this challenge. Ideally,
the dissymmetry between the two helicities inside such cavities is maximized.
In here, we propose a chiral infrared optical cavity formed by planar mirrors
made of diffracting lattices of silver helices with almost maximum
electromagnetic chirality. It combines the strong helicity selectivity of the
helices with the helicity-preserving reflectivity that planar systems show at
large incidence angles. For the manifold of cavity modes which have a component
with zero in-plane momentum, we demonstrate an unprecedented dissymmetry of 95
% inside the cavity at the target frequency, making it a compelling candidate
for enantio-selective applications.

### [142] [Relativistic electrodynamics with a universal length scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08872)
*Tiemo Pedergnana,Florian Kogelbauer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper derives a modified Dirac equation from a fourth-order Klein-Gordon equation, starting from perturbed Maxwell's equations and results in a 32-dimensional Dirac-like equation. They used algebraic factorization and tested their theory's predictions using a modified Stern-Gerlach experiment showing four spin eigenvalues that pair around ±ħ/2. The theory incorporates particle-antiparticle asymmetry and micropolar spacetime. The study provides a framework for hyperfine splitting in quantum systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics and their modifications is crucial for exploring particle physics and potential new phenomena. This paper attempts to extend the relativistic quantum framework by introducing higher-order equations, which might provide insights into unexplained hyperfine structures or new physics beyond the standard model.

Method: The authors start from a singularly perturbed version of Maxwell's equations, algebraically factorize them to derive a 32-dimensional Dirac-like equation, and then modify it to align with a fourth-order Klein-Gordon equation. This involves dealing with a universal length scale which likely introduces higher-order terms into the equations. They also propose an experimental test using a modified Stern-Gerlach experiment focused on hyperfine splitting of electron beams, likely observing distinct spin states to validate their theory.

Result: The analysis reveals that in a Stern-Gerlach setup with their modified equations, four distinct spin states emerge, which align with the standard quantum mechanics predictions of ±ħ/2 when paired. This suggests that their higher-order framework does not drastically alter these fundamental spin outcomes but introduces new degrees of freedom. The presence of particle-antiparticle asymmetry and micropolar spacetime effects is also noted, indicating possible extensions of standard relativistic quantum theory.

Conclusion: The study presents a novel approach to modifying the Dirac equation by introducing a universal length scale, leading to a higher-dimensional variant. The proposed experiment offers a testable method to verify these modifications, focusing on hyperfine splitting. The inclusion of asymmetry in particles and spacetime micropolarity hints at a framework that could reconcile quantum mechanics with higher-order gravitational or other fundamental forces, providing a pathway for future research into quantum gravity or alternative theories of particle physics.

Abstract: We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially
fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting
from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a
32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through
an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the
theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach
experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the
spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic
values of $\pm\hbar/2$. The modified electrodynamic framework features
particle-antiparticle asymmetry and an oriented, micropolar spacetime.

### [143] [Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930)
*Adrien Kahn,Luca Gravina,Filippo Vicentini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new method called Bridge that enhances variational dynamics by improving their performance through post-processing. It does this by allowing direct manipulation of subspaces and circumventing the need to optimize individual states. The method extends concepts like distance and energy to subspaces and uses Monte Carlo estimators. Bridge is computationally inexpensive and significantly reduces discretization errors, making it a practical tool for enhancing variational dynamics methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving the accuracy and efficiency of variational dynamics methods, which are widely used in quantum many-body problems. By providing a novel approach to manipulate subspaces, the method aims to overcome limitations in optimizing individual states and improve the overall performance of these dynamics methods.

Method: The core method presented in the paper is called Bridge. It allows for direct manipulation and optimization of subspaces, which circumvents the necessity of optimizing individual states when using subspace methods. The method leverages determinant state mapping to extend concepts like distance and energy to subspaces, and additionally incorporates Monte Carlo estimators, thereby recovering the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. The paper also introduces the practical application of Bridge, which enhances the performance of variational dynamics by extracting linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. This approach involves creating linear combinations from the evolved states to form a new, higher-dimensional subspace, which allows for more accurate approximations of the true dynamics. The method is computationally inexpensive because it operates on a subspace rather than individual states, reducing the computational overhead while still achieving significant improvements in accuracy. Additionally, the method systematically mitigates errors resulting from the discretization of the dynamics, leading to more precise results.

Result: The result of the paper is the introduction of the Bridge method, which significantly enhances the performance of variational dynamics. Through systematic optimization of subspaces and the use of Monte Carlo estimators, Bridge is able to recover and improve upon the excited states estimation method proposed by Pfau et al. The practical application of Bridge leads to substantial improvements in the accuracy of variational dynamics simulations, with a reduction in discretization errors. Computational analysis shows that Bridge is both highly efficient and effective, making it a valuable tool for advancing the field of quantum many-body dynamics.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of the Bridge method as a powerful tool to enhance the performance of variational dynamics. By enabling direct manipulation and optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need for individual state optimization, and effectively mitigating discretization errors, Bridge represents a significant advancement in the field. The method provides a systematic approach to improving the accuracy and efficiency of variational dynamics simulations, opening up new possibilities for studying complex quantum systems.

Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and
optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states
when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can
naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as
Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method
proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a
method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting
linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is
both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the
errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be
systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.

Abstract: We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with

efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation
qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated
among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to
multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit
gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$
data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$
long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest
neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our
approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation
architectures, with only a constant overhead.

Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a
quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge
modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However,
real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary
interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand
novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report
quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion
quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that
are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for
ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure
time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian
phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number
-- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the
Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg
model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics,
while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological
protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical
signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable
quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly
correlated materials.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic
(FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm.
Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the
FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures
in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square
deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a
polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods
are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2
(ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state
configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative
analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant
enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a
three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal
solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture,
highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.

Abstract: Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological
systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and
zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods
capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system
size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on
the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton
quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for
simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a
deep initial ans\"atze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen
natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state
fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using
resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez
device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the
proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that,
although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the
demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit
simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the
reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a
practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and
early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research into quantum optics detectors, specifically photon-number-resolving detectors, is crucial for advanced quantum communication and information processing. This paper addresses an important aspect by proposing an improved architecture.

Method: The authors derive scattering matrices and photon correlations using Green's functions and input-output formalisms for individual components, then cascade these results to analyze overall detector precision.

Result: The cascaded design shows higher precision in the linear regime and reveals how nonlinear interactions affect detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed detector offers significant performance gains over conventional setups, making it a potential solution for next-gen PNR applications under realistic conditions.

Abstract: We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector
consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each
waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and
sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output
formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for
individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form
expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how
correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this
precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear
regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup,
calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system
parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the
waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of
a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters.
Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional
detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for
next-generation PNR detection.

Abstract: We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z
gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems,
a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates
typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup
of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive
a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the
amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of
magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To
further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase
errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity
quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.

### [150] [Microcausality and Tunneling Times in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09066)
*Mohammed Alkhateeb,Alex Matzkin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates that microcausality prevents superluminal tunneling by proving causal propagation in wave packets with Dirac and Klein-Gordon fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding tunneling dynamics in relativistic quantum fields and ensuring causality.

Method: Used spacetime resolved relativistic quantum field theory, proved microcausality, modeled wave packets, performed numerical computations.

Result: Microcausality prohibits superluminal tunneling; wave packets' effects are within light cones.

Conclusion: Superluminal tunneling is impossible due to causal propagation.

Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum eld
theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal
tunneling dynamics. More specically in this work dealing with Dirac and
Klein-Gordon elds, we rst prove that microcausality holds for such elds in the
presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an
intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet
subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any eect
outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results
with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.

### [151] [Time crystals and nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions mediated by squeezed bath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09072)
*Zhenghao Zhang,Qingtian Miao,G. S. Agarwal*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates time-crystal behavior in nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under squeezed vacuum reservoir influence, showing how squeezing affects phase transitions and reveals new insights into time crystals through spectral analysis and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original time-crystal proposal in the 1970s using coherent driving and cooperative decay drew significant attention. The paper aims to explore how introducing squeezed vacuum environments impacts the behavior of these phase transitions, specifically focusing on the emergence and characteristics of the time-crystal phase.

Method: The research utilizes a combination of theoretical models, mathematical analysis of the Liouvillian superoperator's eigenvalues, steady-state phase diagram analysis, and numerical simulations to study the effects of squeezing on the dissipative phase transition and time-crystal properties.

Result: Increasing squeezing strength in the reservoir sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis shows gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. Subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with squeezing. Time-domain simulations corroborate these findings by showing that the imaginary parts of Liouvillian eigenvalues correspond to oscillation frequencies in the time-crystal phase. Additionally, the study reveals quantum fluctuations characteristics in the time-crystal phase, opening new avenues for exploring time crystals in engineered quantum systems.

Conclusion: The research extends our understanding of time-crystal behavior in dissipative systems under external reservoir modifications. It highlights the potential for engineering systems with squeezed environments to study and control time-crystal properties. The study also paves the way for future research into quantum fluctuations and the design of new quantum devices based on these insights.

Abstract: Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of
cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by
Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal
behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was
seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that
describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay
depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir
correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the
Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the
nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed
vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of
the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength
sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian
reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the
thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real
parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing
squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir
properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies
correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also
present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results
call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based
on engineered environments.

### [152] [The temporal resolution limit in quantum sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09172)
*Cong-Gang Song,Qing-yu Cai*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The study establishes a lower bound on interrogation time in quantum sensing by combining distinguishability of quantum states with quantum speed limits, showing that below this bound, information loss occurs. The results are generalized to time-dependent Hamiltonians and validated through applications to magnetic field measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is focused on quantum sensing and temporal resolution, which are important for emerging technologies in quantum information processing. Understanding the limits on interrogation time can help optimize experimental designs and applications in fields like magnetometry.

Method: The authors combine the distinguishability condition of quantum states with quantum speed limits to derive a lower bound on the interrogation time. This involves theoretical analysis and the extension to time-dependent Hamiltonians likely requiring mathematical derivations and proofs.

Result: They present a theoretical framework that provides a lower limit on the interrogation time, proving that below this limit, the output state is indistinguishable from the input state, leading to information loss due to noise. The framework is generalized for any time-dependent signal Hamiltonian, suggesting broad applicability. The practical implications are demonstrated through examples in magnetic field measurements.

Conclusion: The study contributes to the understanding of the fundamental limits in quantum sensing related to temporal resolution. By providing a method to calculate the minimum interrogation time, it offers practical guidance for the design and optimization of quantum sensors in applications involving time-dependent signals and magnetic field measurements.

Abstract: Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This
study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum
speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the
interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes
statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will
inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these
conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain
quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation
time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of
quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.

Abstract: Quantum metrology experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics have
demonstrated measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit via
multi-particle entanglement. At the same time, electron microscopy, an
essential tool for high-resolution imaging of biological systems, is severely
constrained in its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by shot noise, due to the dose
limit imposed by electron beam-induced damage. Here, we show theoretically that
spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural
fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation
of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb
interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the
fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward
electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.

Conclusion: 研究为理解量子叠加提供了新的量化方法，有助于更深入研究量子计算和信息处理。

Abstract: Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the
Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm,
quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and
crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of
coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource
theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly
independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will
focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal
subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such
measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert
spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of
coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence
measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other
reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order
relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's
natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be
the last part of this work.

### [155] [Defects and their Time Scales in Quantum and Classical Annealing of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09273)
*Phillip Weinberg,Na Xu,Anders W. Sandvik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper investigates quantum phase transitions in a 2D Ising model under quantum annealing, analyzing the scaling of various observables and comparing quantum and classical dynamic scaling behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by exploring how quantum effects influence the efficiency of quantum annealing algorithms, particularly in terms of phase transitions and defect dynamics.

Method: The authors use exact numerical solutions for small systems (up to 6x6) to study defect dynamics during quantum annealing. They also employ analogies with classical simulated annealing to compare scaling behaviors of different types of defects.

Result: The study finds that quantum systems exhibit specific scaling behaviors for domain walls with different winding numbers, where the Kibble-Zurek mechanism dominates the scaling for some defects, while others scale differently. The system-spanning defects show different dynamic scales in quantum versus classical annealing.

Conclusion: The research highlights the crucial role of topology and winding numbers in defect dynamics during quantum phase transitions, offering insights into optimizing quantum annealing algorithms.

Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising
ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high
to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe
the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with
$z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also
observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The
excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time
scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects,
with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated
annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find
differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on
time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in
systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed
in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ
scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales
with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The
$L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method
that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.

Motivation: The paper is about improving the performance of Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs), which are important in quantum optics and low-noise amplification.

Method: The authors developed a single-step lithography process, using a series LC circuit for impedance engineering. They used a Dolan bridge technique for Al-AlOx-Al deposition. They observed 18 dB gain and low saturation power.

Result: They achieved nearly quantum-limited amplification with a 400 MHz bandwidth and -114 dBm saturation power. They extended existing theories to explain their results.

Conclusion: This work leads to simpler fabrication of broadband JPAs and provides a new theoretical understanding.

Abstract: We present the experimental demonstration of an impedance-engineered
Josephson parametric amplifier (IEJPA) fabricated in a single-step lithography
process. Impedance engineering is implemented using a lumped-element series LC
circuit. We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device --
impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam
lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for
Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe nearly quantum-limited amplification with
18 dB gain over a wide 400 MHz bandwidth centered around 5.3 GHz, and a
saturation power of -114 dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results,
we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the
full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a
path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical
foundation for a novel regime of JPA operation.

Abstract: We present an ultrastrong superinductor-based coupling consisting of a flux
qubit galvanically coupled to a resonator. The coupling inductor is fabricated
in granular Aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface
inductances. Spectroscopy measurements on the qubit-resonator system reveal a
Bloch-Siegert shift of \SI{23}{\mega\hertz} and a coupling fraction of
$g/\omega_r \simeq 0.13$, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling (USC)
regime. We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by
low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c =
(0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$.
Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics
in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low
persistent currents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to extend the understanding of entanglement structures and their transformation capabilities in quantum systems beyond qubits to higher-dimensional qudits, which is a significant advancement in quantum resource theories and applications.

Method: The method involves using subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and decomposing prime-power qudit stabilizer states into prime-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits through specific local unitaries beyond the Clifford group.

Result: The authors successfully generalize the transformation techniques to arbitrary integer dimensions, enabling more versatile entanglement distributions in quantum protocols.

Conclusion: This work broadens the scope of entanglement resource transformations for stabilizer states, providing tools that enhance the efficiency of quantum communication and computation protocols by leveraging the properties of GHZ states and EPR pairs in higher dimensions.

Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$
qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under
arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed
that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local
Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and
unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize
this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the
Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states
into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm
leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to
quantum protocols requiring efficient entanglement distribution.

Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of
strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in
regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large.
In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum
plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting
quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates,
combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of
laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the
identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma
waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other
proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum
computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that
cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear
quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.

Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in
quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional
methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters,
nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and
precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered
optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum
photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a
promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven
spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a
metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin
state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical
and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and
compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement.
Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a
concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29
microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity
components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.

Abstract: We study classical and quantum echoes in a Kerr oscillator driven by a
frequency-controlling pulsed perturbation. We consider dynamical response to
the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schr\"odinger cat states
constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent
states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric
drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to
exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative
phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the
effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We
demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum
echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the
perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating
errors of cat qubits.

Abstract: A set of new schemes for quantum computation and communication have been
either designed or experimentally realized using optimal quantum resources. A
multi-output quantum teleportation scheme, where a sender (Alice) teleports an
m and m+1-qubit GHZ-like unknown state to a receiver (Bob), has been
demonstrated using two copies of the Bell state instead of a five-qubit cluster
state and implemented on IBM's quantum computer for the m=1 case. Another
scheme, known as quantum broadcasting where a known state is sent to two
spatially separated parties (Bob and Charlie) has also been realized using two
Bell states. It is shown that existing quantum broadcasting schemes can be
reduced to multiparty remote state preparation. After achieving teleportation
of unknown and known states, sending a quantum operator becomes the next step.
A scheme for remote implementation of operators (RIO), specifically a
controlled joint-RIO (CJRIO), has been proposed using a four-qubit
hyper-entangled state involving spatial and polarization degrees of freedom. In
this direction, two more variants, remote implementation of hidden and
partially unknown operators (RIHO and RIPUO) have also been proposed. Their
success probabilities are analyzed considering dissipation of an auxiliary
coherent state interacting with the environment. For secure multiparty tasks
like quantum voting or auction, secure multiparty quantum computation (SMQC)
becomes essential. A quantum anonymous voting (QAV) scheme has been
experimentally implemented on IBM's quantum computer. Finally, two quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, coherent one-way (COW) and differential phase
shift (DPS), are experimentally demonstrated and the key rates are analyzed as
functions of post-processing parameters and detector dead times across various
distances.

TL;DR: 研究利用两个非零参数构造了大的n×n实伪对称矩阵，分析了其对称性和谱统计学，发现非零参数符号影响了特征值的分布，当λμ>0时，谱分布符合维格纳统计，而λμ<0时特征值呈现中间统计特性，矩阵属于伪正交群，这类矩阵用于PT对称量子系统的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 想要了解通过调整参数λ和μ来构造实伪对称矩阵，并研究其对称性和谱统计学特性，特别是他们如何影响特征值的分布和矩阵群的属性，以及这些矩阵在物理系统中的应用，如PT对称量子系统。

Method: 通过引入两个参数构造伪对称矩阵，并研究其对称性、谱分布以及特征值的统计特性，检测不同参数下矩阵的分类和属性。

Result: 当λμ>0时，所有特征值为实数，符合维格纳统计；当λμ<0时，特征值为实或共轭复数对，统计特性介于极端和正态之间；矩阵的对角化矩阵在伪正交群中，适用于PT对称量子系统的研究。

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了通过调整参数控制量子系统对称性以影响谱分布的能力，为研究PT对称性提供了新的数学框架。

Abstract: Here, using two real non-zero parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$, we construct
Gaussian pseudo-orthogonal ensembles of a large number $N$ of $n \times n$ ($n$
even and large) real pseudo-symmetric matrices under the metric $\eta$ using $
\altmathcal {N}=n(n+1)/2$ elements independently drawn from a Gaussian random
population and investigate the statistical properties of the eigenvalues. When
$\lambda \mu >0$, we show that the pseudo-symmetric matrix is similar to a real
symmetric matrix, consequently, all the eigenvalues are real and so the
spectral distributions satisfy Wigner's statistics. But when $\lambda \mu <0$
the eigenvalues are either real or complex conjugate pairs. We find that these
real eigenvalues exhibit intermediate statistics. We show that the
diagonalizing matrices ${ \cal D}$ of these pseudo-symmetric matrices are
pseudo-orthogonal under a constant metric $\zeta$ as $ \altmathcal{D}^t \zeta
\altmathcal{D}= \zeta$, and hence they belong to a pseudo-orthogonal group.
These pseudo-symmetric matrices serve to represent the parity-time
(PT)-symmetric quantum systems having exact (un-broken) or broken PT-symmetry.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy
content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of
quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context.
The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the
system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a
classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of
interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into
account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and
cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.

*Sourish Wawdhane,Sashwat Anagolum,Poulami Das,Yunong Shi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Ensemble-IR presents a solution to efficiently represent large sets of related quantum circuits by encoding a shared program, enabling reverse engineering and concatenation into individual circuits as needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quantum tools require explicit enumeration of each circuit, which becomes impractical for large workloads. There's a need for a more efficient representation to capture family relationships between circuits.

Method: Ensemble-IR uses a unified program that captures common structure and symbolic parameters. This allows for flexible reconstruction of individual circuits without requiring upfront enumeration.

Result: The approach scales well with 18 real-world workloads, showing high utility for scalable quantum system development.

Conclusion: Ensemble-IR offers a promising framework for managing ensemble workloads in quantum computing by reducing redundancy and enabling dynamic circuit generation.

Abstract: Emerging quantum applications such as error mitigation, system
characterization, and hybrid protocols often require running large families of
related quantum circuits. Existing intermediate representations (IRs) and
frameworks such as Qiskit, QIR, MitiQ, and OpenQASM do not provide primitives
to concisely express such workloads. These tools instead rely on explicit
enumeration of the unique circuits within each workload. We introduce
Ensemble-IR, an intermediate representation designed to concisely express these
ensemble workloads. Rather than enumerating each circuit separately,
Ensemble-IR encodes an entire workload through a rich, shared unified program.
This program specifies common circuit structure along with symbolic operations
to express points of variation - such as gate types, gate placement, parameter
values, or qubit configurations. Ensemble-IR enables quantum systems to load an
entire family of circuits onto a device as a single concise file, allowing
contained circuits to instead be recreated on-the-fly at runtime. We
demonstrate Ensemble-IR across 18 real-world workloads from prior literature,
highlighting its widespread utility for scalable quantum system development.

Conclusion: 研究发现不同耦合下系统表现出丰富的热流现象，强耦合和非线性情况下内生整流增强，这为设计量子热机等应用提供了理论指导。

Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at
different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular,
the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an
inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to
the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a
circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of
current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.
While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the
sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,
highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the
detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the
nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the
current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the
rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or
negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the
current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect
to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate
formulas.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for enhancing entanglement, achieving
asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and creating nonreciprocal
quantum correlations within a hybrid system. This system integrates a yttrium
iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which exhibits magnon-phonon coupling via
magnetostriction, with a silica sphere featuring optomechanical
whispering-gallery modes. By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic
field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and
nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes.
We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost
stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal
noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and
both one-way and two-way steering. The proposed system is experimentally
feasible and holds significant promise for various quantum information
applications.

### [168] [Exploiting emergent symmetries in disorder-averaged quantum dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09614)
*Mirco Erpelding,Adrian Braemer,Martin Gärttner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper discusses using symmetry in quantum systems to improve simulation efficiency. It presents methods to construct symmetric sectors of a disordered-averaged dynamical map to simulate large systems, like an Ising model with random interactions, which reduces the computational burden by leveraging symmetry in the averaged system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to make numerical simulations of disordered quantum systems more efficient by exploiting symmetries, which are often reduced in such systems but crucial for understanding quantum dynamics.

Method: The methods involve developing schemes using short-time and weak-disorder expansions to construct symmetric sectors, and applying these to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in a transverse field to validate the approach.

Result: The result shows that the symmetric subspace scales polynomially with the number of spins, enabling large-scale simulations that were previously computationally infeasible.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that symmetry can effectively be utilized in the numerical simulation of disordered systems, leading to significant efficiency gains and the ability to study larger quantum systems than before.

Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many
other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical
simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced
symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making
their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying
quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of
observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution
operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at
the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently
constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using
short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it
to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a
transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively
permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales
polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large
system.

*J. Naji,R. Jafari,Alireza Akbari,M. Abdi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper studies how noise affects the dynamics of a quantum system during a quench, using specific measures. They find that when noise is present, both quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase skew information decay exponentially with the noise intensity affecting the optimal quench time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to understand the impact of noise on quantum systems, particularly during phase transitions. This is relevant for quantum computing and information processing.

Method: The study uses the transverse field Ising model, measures QFI and WYSI under quench dynamics, introducing noise as a perturbation to observe effects.

Result: Without noise, both measures increase with ramp time. With noise, they decay exponentially, and optimal ramp time scales with noise variance.

Conclusion: Noise significantly impacts quantum coherence measures during quenches, offering insights into optimizing noisy quantum systems.

Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising
model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin
correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and
Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the
absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase
monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits
without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When
noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change
dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp
quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the
maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum,
scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that
determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy
quantum annealing.

Result: 模型在测试集上的Pearson相关系数为0.694，抗噪声能力在引入外界噪声时表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了量子计算在加速药物发现中的潜在应用，尤其是虚拟筛选方法的可行性及其抗噪声性能。

Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for
identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies
(delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical
libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand
conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks
computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum
convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind
efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and
12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing
model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To
assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While
noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation
coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility
and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and
highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.

Abstract: Magic state distillation and injection is a promising strategy towards
universal fault tolerant quantum computation, especially in architectures based
on the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes where non-Clifford gates
remain challenging to implement. Here we address GKP magic state preparation by
studying a non-Gaussian unitary mediated by a Kerr interaction which realizes a
logical gate $\sqrt{H}_L$ for square GKP codes. This gate does not directly
involve an auxiliary qubit and is compatible with finite energy constraints on
the code. Fidelity can be further enhanced using the small-Big-small (SBS)
error correction protocol and post-selection, making the scheme robust against
a single photon loss event. We finally propose a circuit QED implementation to
operate the Kerr interaction.

Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of
equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial
x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an
21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$,
enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including
two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles
for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad
gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This
approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of
Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial
condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more
than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results
demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full
quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face
challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This
limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$
observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current
limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems
of equations, and they point to the need for the development of
measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.

*Yoshiharu Kawamura*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper proposes using generalized matrix mechanics and multiple commutators as a discrete model of Nambu mechanics, drawing parallels to Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: It draws inspiration from Heisenberg's foundational work on matrix mechanics, using the correspondence principle, to develop a discrete dynamical system model following Nambu mechanics principles, which is a higher-order generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics.

Method: The paper starts with Nambu mechanics and applies a method inspired by Heisenberg's approach, using generalized matrices and multiple commutators to reconstruct dynamics that include physical quantities as generalized matrices.

Result: The result shows that multiple commutators serve as a discrete version of the Nambu bracket, linking the dynamics to quantization.

Conclusion: The conclusion posits that such a generalized matrix mechanics provides a valid discrete model for Nambu mechanics with physical quantities in matrix form.

Abstract: Taking as a model the fact that Heisenberg's matrix mechanics was derived
from Hamiltonian mechanics using the correspondence principle, we explore a
class of dynamical systems involving discrete variables, with Nambu mechanics
as the starting point. Specifically, we reconstruct an extended version of
matrix mechanics that describes dynamical systems possessing physical
quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm
that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a
discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that quantum error correction is essential for
realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent experiments have
demonstrated error correction codes operating below threshold, primarily using
local planar codes such as the surface code and color code. In parallel,
theoretical advances in quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes promise
significantly lower overheads, albeit at the cost of requiring non-local parity
checks. While these results are encouraging, implementing such codes remains
challenging for near-term experiments, creating obstacles to holistic
benchmarking of hardware architectures capable of supporting long-range
couplers. In this work, we present a simple construction recipe for small
quantum LDPC codes based on recent developments in the field. Our codes are
approximately twice as efficient as comparable surface codes, yet require only
weight-four parity checks, which simplifies experimental realization compared
to other quantum LDPC codes. We provide concrete proposals for implementations
with superconducting qubits in flip-chip architectures and with semiconductor
spin qubits using shuttling-based approaches.

TL;DR: Using a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator with a diamond quantum sensor enhances SNR by 17x, achieving 170 fT/√Hz sensitivity, surpassing the thermal limit of magnetometers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of improving quantum sensor sensitivity beyond the thermal limit, a long-standing issue in the field.

Method: Combines a diamond quantum sensor with a Van der Pol oscillator to create a system exhibiting exceptional points and non-adiabatic transitions, achieving enhanced SNR.

Result: The hybrid system achieves a significant 17x SNR enhancement, reaching 170 fT/√Hz, surpassing the thermal limit limit for magnetometers.

Conclusion: This breakthrough paves the way for next-generation quantum sensors with enhanced sensitivity using nonlinearity and exceptional point physics.

Abstract: Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new
behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce,
are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor
response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase
shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at
linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which
exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a
state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator,
forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and
bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both
adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state
switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed
near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity
of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal,
thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate
regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in
synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions
remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their
representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate
hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to
systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits
(VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over
a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models,
which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator,
consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable
quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In
particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas
those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence,
ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model
sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically
reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate
the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully
integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and
pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image
synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution
tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging
quantum hardware.

Abstract: Decoherence due to radiative decay remains an important consideration in
scaling superconducting quantum processors. We introduce a passive,
interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the
intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By
taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the
device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference.
These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries
-- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase
mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways.
We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave
electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken
transmon qubit with improved coherence times.

Conclusion: 方法为理解弱测值序列的行为提供了框架，并在量子信息中有广泛应用

Abstract: We investigate the sequential composition of weak values in the framework of
time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Specifically, we consider a forward'' weak
measurement from a preselected state $\ket{\psi}$ to a post-selected state
$\ket{\phi}$, followed by a reverse'' weak measurement. We show that the
product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation
value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi
= \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing
the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information,
particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of
$A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$
with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism
of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in
quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum
computing, and show how the phase of a weak value can be inferred via strong
measurements in the pure-state case.

Abstract: Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for
implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates
are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition
techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for
decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in
account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,
we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we
introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor
product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into
single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries
generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).
Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with
identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result
also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit
rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the
layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based
implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited
to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach
yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based
implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also
requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the
routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited
connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss
method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to
optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.

TL;DR: The paper presents a quantum algorithm for the finite-horizon discrete-time LQG control problem, offering a quantum speedup over classical methods by leveraging quantum linear algebra primitives and QSVT techniques. The algorithm's time complexity scales polylogarithmically with system dimension and linearly with time horizon, providing an exponential improvement for large n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitations of classical computation in handling large system dimensions in control problems lead to a need for quantum algorithms to offer exponential speedups. This paper addresses that by proposing a quantum LQG algorithm.

Method: The method integrates quantum linear algebra techniques, including block-encoded matrices and QSVT for matrix inversion and multiplication, to reformulate the classical LQG pipeline.

Result: The quantum algorithm achieves polylogarithmic scaling with system dimension and linear scaling with time horizon, providing an asymptotic speedup compared to classical methods.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates a quantum solution for LQG control, highlighting the potential of quantum computing in solving complex control problems that are computationally intensive for classical systems.

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving the finite-horizon discrete-time
Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem, which integrates optimal
control and state estimation in the presence of stochastic disturbances and
noise. Classical approaches to LQG require solving a backward Riccati recursion
and a forward Kalman filter, both requiring computationally expensive matrix
operations with overall time complexity $\mathcal{O}(T n^3)$, where $n$ is the
system dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. While efficient classical solvers
exist, especially for small to medium-sized systems, their computational
complexity grows rapidly with system dimension. To address this, we reformulate
the full LQG pipeline using quantum linear algebra primitives, including
block-encoded matrix representations and quantum singular value transformation
(QSVT) techniques for matrix inversion and multiplication. We formally analyze
the time complexity of each algorithmic component. Under standard assumptions
on matrix condition numbers and encoding precision, the total runtime of the
quantum LQG algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the system dimension $n$
and linearly with the time horizon $T$, offering an asymptotic quantum speedup
over classical methods.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its

a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control
fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The
entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is
formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is
validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in
achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations

Abstract: We evaluated a multi-color two-photon entangled state generated in silicon

the generated quantum state by performing quantum state tomography on the

TL;DR: Paper proposes a method to analyze quantum networks using few measurements and error mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum networks are essential for distributing entanglement, which is critical for quantum communication and computing.

Method: Propsed a scheme using two local measurements per qubit and entropic uncertainty, with quantum error mitigation techniques.

Result: Experiments show PEC removes errors in correlations and VD enhances noise tolerance from 8.8% to 26.4%.

Conclusion: The method is scalable and practical for quantum network studies, aiding future research.

Abstract: Paramount for performances of quantum network applications are the structure
and quality of distributed entanglement. Here we propose a scalable and
efficient approach to reveal the topological information of unknown quantum
networks, and quantify entanglement simultaneously. The scheme exploits
entropic uncertainty, an operationally meaningful measure of correlation, by
performing only two local measurements on each qubit. Moreover, when
measurement outcomes in each node are collectively evaluated, integrating
uncertainty and mutual information enables a direct count of the number of
bipartite sources between any two nodes. This surpasses what is possible via
applying either approach solely. Moreover, quantum error mitigation techniques
including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and virtual distillation (VD),
which have been widely applied to suppress biases in single expectation value,
are further incorporated to mitigate errors in entropic quantities. We find
that PEC successfully removes deviations in correlation estimations. Meanwhile,
VD extends the depolarizing noise strength that allows for valid bipartite
entanglement certification from 8.8% to 26.4%, thus substantially enhancing
robustness against bias-inducing noise in practical situations. The proposal is
applicable to a broad variety of platforms and helps to spur future studies
toward harnessing the advantages of quantum networks.

Abstract: A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal
transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between
superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the
quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based
opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by
an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching
quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with
input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this
magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum
channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which
quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of
improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible
improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions
membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a
quantum network with reasonable averaging times.

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central
problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be
used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can
be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable
as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

Conclusion: 论文认为量子波函数的本体论地位更应被视为实在而非知识的反映，这对理解量子力学的不确定性原理有指导意义。

Abstract: The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most
debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the
wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations
treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic
approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the
uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast,
treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation
of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We
examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view
falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.

TL;DR:  paper introduces DIPQRB, a method for DI QRNG with relaxed device requirements, allowing high-performance devices only for servers and cheaper for clients, while ensuring privacy. 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DIQRNG protocols are too stringent for practical use, so finding a less demanding approach is needed. 

Method: The proposed DIPQRB uses routed Bell tests to distribute device requirements, allowing clients to use cheaper devices while keeping outputs private. 

Result: Experiments validate the feasibility and practicality of DIPQRB, showing its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. 

Conclusion: DIPQRB represents a valuable advance in practical quantum random number generation, making it more accessible and secure for cryptographic uses.

Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold
standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably
random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device
requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical
applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness
Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted
devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the
device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness
from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a
network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate
high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more
cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also
private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic
applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate
secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.

*Petr O. Jedlička,Šimon Kos,Martin Šmíd,Jiří Vomlel,Jan Slavík*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The abstract discusses a new poll in quantum mechanics where physicists' preferences have remained mostly the same over the past decade, especially favoring the Copenhagen interpretation due to its educational emphasis and practicality. The researchers expanded their survey to a more diverse group, suggesting that despite theoretical debates, interpretational stability still exists.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the preferences of physicists in the face of quantum mechanics' foundational debates, especially over a significant period like 10 years, this paper is likely aiming to assess interpretational trends and their reasons.

Method: The research involves conducting a new poll within the physics community, recruiting a larger, more diverse sample than the previous survey. They compare their findings with previous studies to identify trends.

Result: The survey confirms that despite foundational debates, physicists continue to prefer the Copenhagen interpretation. Educational factors and practicality in avoiding metaphysical issues are key reasons for this preference.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the interpretational preferences in quantum mechanics are relatively stable, influenced mainly by the Copenhagen interpretation's pedagogical roots and its pragmatic benefits.

Abstract: As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this
paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research
community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the
specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we
expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader
community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists'
views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While
quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate
a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring
support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen
interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical
questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave).
Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational
preferences over the past decades.

### [193] [Indiscernibility of quantum states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10027)
*Jan van Neerven,Marijn Waaijer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper presents a mathematical framework for understanding the indiscernibility of quantum states by defining distinguishable objects as equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to a set of observables. The structure of these objects, known as Holevo spaces, is explored, showing that observables can be naturally represented as continuous functions on these spaces. Several examples are provided, such as position measurements and spin measurements in EPR and Bell experiments, illustrating the framework's application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses fundamental questions in quantum mechanics regarding how quantum states can be distinguished based on observable quantities. The motivation stems from the desire to formalize the concept of indistinguishability among quantum states, which is crucial for understanding quantum information and quantum experiments.

Method: The authors use a mathematical approach, defining equivalent classes based on observable distinctions, and analyze their structure as Holevo spaces. They demonstrate that observables can be lifted to continuous functions on these spaces using appropriate mathematical techniques related to topology and functional analysis.

Result: The main result is the successful development of a framework where distinguishable quantum objects are formalized, allowing for the representation of observables as continuous functions on Holevo spaces. This framework provides a clearer understanding of the relationship between observables and quantum states, particularly in scenarios involving high precision measurements like position and spin in multipartite systems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by highlighting the potential of this framework to advance the study of quantum information theory and quantum mechanics, especially in contexts where distinguishing quantum states plays a central role, such as in quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of
quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable
objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the
observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the
Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables
admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is
illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be
described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted
functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for
spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.

Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be
upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight
fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture
that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight
matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular
graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of
regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of
the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional
Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional
matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm
to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as
possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision
tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show
any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.

Result: 推导出的 master 方程满足局部性和详细平衡条件，关键在于量子相干的抵消作用。不同系统结构都得到了验证。

Conclusion: 该研究成功建立了一个热力学一致的量子 master 方程描述方法。这对于研究量子 Many-Body 热力学具有重要意义。成功的点在于推导不依赖耗散近似且处理了能量间隙为零的情况。未来的工作可能需要对更一般的系统结构进行测试，并寻求类似的简洁公式。

Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that
satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical
baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides
exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance
condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath.
This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in
systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our
result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body
systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description
of quantum many-body systems.

TL;DR: This paper investigates the impact of quantum circuit design parameters on hybrid quantum-classical neural networks for a causal classification task. They examine depth of the variational ansatz and feature mapping choices, using a combination of a CNN and a parameterized quantum circuit. The results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions improves generalization and stability, but beyond a certain point, the benefits plateau. They also find that only multi-axis Pauli rotations in the feature mapping enable successful learning, while simpler maps lead to underfitting. They use PCA and silhouette scores to analyze data distributions. The study provides practical guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models, with all source codes and tools available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper combines quantum computing with machine learning, focusing on hybrid models, which is a rapidly growing field. Understanding how quantum components affect model performance is crucial for optimizing such systems.

Method: The study employs a systematic approach, training hybrid models with different quantum circuit depths and feature mappings. They likely use machine learning techniques to analyze data distributions and evaluate model performance metrics like generalization and stability.

Result: The study reveals that increasing the number of quantum circuit repetitions up to a certain depth improves performance, but beyond that point, no further benefits are observed. Additionally, the choice of feature mapping is critical; only multi-axis Pauli rotations lead to successful learning, whereas simpler maps result in underfitting.

Conclusion: The findings offer practical guidelines for designing quantum layers in hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, highlighting the importance of feature mapping selection and the trade-offs between circuit depth and performance.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the
depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping,
affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal
classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network
for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as
the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different
feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions
improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau
beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical:
only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning,
while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability.
Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data
distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical
guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and
evaluation tools are publicly available.

Abstract: Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and
integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against
both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication
in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the
quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS)
protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP).
Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS
because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we
present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a
distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In
contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal
and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future
investigations into the development of AQS protocols.

Abstract: The tunneling effect driven by waveform-controlled laser pulses is a
cornerstone of attosecond science and contributes decisively to its extreme
time resolution. In the spatial domain, electron tunneling through a
bias-driven junction between a nanotip and a surface enables atomic-scale
spatial resolution in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, first
signatures of attosecond modulation of STM currents have shown that
simultaneous attosecond-nanometer resolution is feasible. However, while
sub-cycle attosecond dynamics are routinely controlled and determined with high
precision, controlling the direction of the currents and determining their
duration have remained elusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunneling currents
using two-color laser pulses and dynamically control their direction, relying
solely on the sub-cycle waveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data
onto numerical and analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation reveals non-adiabatic tunneling as the underlying physical mechanism,
yielding current burst durations on the order of 900 as. Despite working under
ambient conditions but free from thermal artifacts, we achieve a lateral
spatial resolution of 2 nm and sub-angstr\"om topographic sensitivity.
Directional control of attosecond bursts in STM will enable triggering and
detecting ultrafast charge dynamics in molecular systems and defect states at
the spatio-temporal frontier of microscopy.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential resources in quantum information
processing. In this work, we investigate methods for quantifying bosonic
non-Gaussianity in many-body systems. Building on recent theoretical insights
into the self-convolution properties of bosonic pure states, we introduce
non-Gaussian entropy as a new measure to characterize non-Gaussianity in
bosonic pure states. We further propose a practical protocol for measuring
non-Gaussian entropy using three beam splitters and four copies of the input
state. In addition, we extend this framework to mixed states, providing a
general approach to quantifying non-Gaussianity. Our results offer a convenient
and efficient method for characterizing bosonic non-Gaussianity, paving the way
for its implementation on near-term experimental platforms.

*Xiantao Li*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: This paper introduces a universal method for quantum simulations using non-unitary dynamics by embedding them into a larger unitary framework, supporting a wide range of dilation schemes with various mathematical generators and tuning parameters, and they validate it through numerical experiments on wave propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the challenge of simulating non-unitary dynamics in quantum systems, a problem that is not typically amenable to standard quantum simulation techniques. This is relevant because many physical systems, especially complex ones, involve non-unitary processes which make traditional approaches inapplicable, necessitating a novel method to simulate such systems quantum mechanically.

Method: The authors propose constructing a dilation framework that maps non-unitary dynamics into a larger unitary evolution by introducing an enlarged Hilbert space. This framework is algebraically defined with conditions based on moments matching, allowing for the recovery of existing schemes and the discovery of new ones. They employ differential, integral, and other types of generators and introduce a continuous tuning parameter.

Result: The paper achieves theoretical results by deriving parametrized families of dilations and demonstrates through numerical experiments that their method leads to near-optimal complexity and robustness in simulating Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation.

Conclusion: The approach provides a versatile and tunable framework for implementing quantum simulations of non-unitary dynamics, showing promise in practical applications and offering a flexible design space for optimization tailored to specific scenarios. This breakthrough paves the way for advancing quantum computing in modeling complex physical phenomena and opens new possibilities in areas like materials science and wave propagation where non-unitary behaviors are prevalent.

Abstract: Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary
time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic
physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal
moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x =
A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert
space: \[
  ( (l| \otimes I )
  \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt}
  ( |r) \otimes I )
  = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$
satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in
the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both
\emph{Schr\"odingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the
linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603
(2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from
differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each
family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under
similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an
overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be
co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware.
  As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation
in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical
experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and
robustness of the approach.

Motivation: The accurate computation of excited states is crucial for understanding quantum systems, but current numerical methods face significant limitations. This paper proposes an innovative approach to overcome these challenges, potentially leading to more precise simulations of quantum systems.

Method: The authors extend neural quantum states by incorporating Grassmann geometry and Stochastic Reconfiguration for simultaneous optimization of multiple wave functions, along with multidimensional operator variances and overlaps.

Result: The method achieves high accuracy in energies and observables for excited states in the Heisenberg model on a square lattice, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing variational methods.

Conclusion: The approach based on Grassmann geometry and Stochastic Reconfiguration offers a robust framework for enhancing the computation of excited states in quantum matter, potentially revolutionizing numerical methods in this field. This work opens new possibilities for studying complex quantum systems through machine learning techniques and advanced theoretical frameworks.

Abstract: Excited states play a central role in determining the physical properties of
quantum matter, yet their accurate computation in many-body systems remains a
formidable challenge for numerical methods. While neural quantum states have
delivered outstanding results for ground-state problems, extending their
applicability to excited states has faced limitations, including instability in
dense spectra and reliance on symmetry constraints or penalty-based
formulations. In this work, we rigorously formalize the framework introduced by
Pfau et al.~\cite{pfau2024accurate} in terms of Grassmann geometry of the
Hilbert space. This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration
method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave
functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances
and overlaps. We validate our approach on the Heisenberg quantum spin model on
the square lattice, achieving highly accurate energies and physical observables
for a large number of excited states.

Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a
nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for
exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general
equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or
dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum
i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with
arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states
is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems
that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class
of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem
that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class
of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.

Abstract: Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)
typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection
efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the
non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the
exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately
predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming
the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the
impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the
model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model
simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum
efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant
$\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be
achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally
gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key
distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and
related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of
dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as
supplementary material for swift adoption.

Abstract: Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020)
is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state,
which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable
on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows
received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum
computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a
major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of
generating the classical snapshot.
  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central
building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as
possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions
over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we
create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently
prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This
state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably
weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical
shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for
\emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use
\emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge,
\emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the
literature prior to our work.
  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the
part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell
basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.

Abstract: In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and
optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to
quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal
microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and
understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable
single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile,
single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying
polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the
temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is
assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade
technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre
emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order
autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by
varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while
polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate.
Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an
acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we
demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a
single NV centre. This work establishes a straightforward and effective
protocol for laser excitation optimization, enhancing the performance and
reliability of NV-based quantum sensors.

Abstract: Collective coherent noise poses challenges for fault-tolerant quantum error
correction (FTQEC), as it falls outside the usual stochastic noise models.
While constant excitation (CE) codes can naturally avoid coherent noise, a
complete fault-tolerant framework for the use of these codes under realistic
noise models has been elusive. Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant
architecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing
that transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce
CE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome
extraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla.
This enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with
CE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm
that efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using
our framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and
$[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong
performance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete
FTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise.
This highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum
processors dominated by collective coherent noise.

TL;DR: The study shows that a quantum sensor based on a frustrated three-spin system can detect signals above a certain threshold, operates at the Heisenberg limit in an entangled configuration, and has applications in various detection scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to develop quantum-based sensors for signal detection and tracking, leveraging quantum systems' enhanced capabilities for sensitivity.

Method: The researchers investigate the response using an adiabatic approximation and analyze the spectral components varying with magnetic field strength.

Result: The sensors exhibit threshold-based detection, operate at Heisenberg sensitivity in entangled setups, and can be applied in environments like particle tracking and long-distance observation.

Conclusion: This quantum sensor offers significant advantages for signal detection over traditional methods, especially in noisy environments, through its threshold response and high sensitivity.

Abstract: We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based
on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical
time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a
critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying
approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear
dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial
states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that
below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| < b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to
the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the
signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately
omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor
configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such
detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a
noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum
bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and
long-baseline telescopy.

Result: ishes the classification of diagonal transversal Clifford gates achievable by stabilizer codes by categorizing them into six specific families of matrix groups. Additionally, the paper provides a thorough description of diagonal Clifford symmetries across multiple code blocks using Rains' framework, contributing secondary theorems.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that all diagonal transversal Clifford gates for any stabilizer code necessarily belong to one of these six matrix group families.

Abstract: This work classifies stabilizer codes by the set of diagonal Clifford gates

### [211] [Sensing the binding and unbinding of anyons at impurities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08928)
*Glenn Wagner,Titus Neupert*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper explores how quasihole anyons in the Laughlin ν=1/3 state can bind to impurities through attractive interactions while repulsive between themselves. The number of quasiholes bound depends on the chemical potential. Experimental methods like STM and exciton spectroscopy are suggested. Strong impurities are needed for this effect, which might be possible using zero-field FCI in twisted moire structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper is relevant for understanding the quantum Hall effect and topological phases, as it discusses an exotic quantum phenomenon (anyons) and their binding to impurities, which could lead to new insights into quantum matter and potentially new materials for quantum computing.

Method: The study uses theoretical modeling, likely tight-binding and renormalization group methods, to analyze the binding of quasihole anyons to impurities. They probably consider the competition between attractive and repulsive interactions using numerical methods or exact diagonalization. Experimental proposals are also discussed, maybe using STM and exciton spectroscopy to observe bound states.

Result: The key finding is that impurities with strong enough attractive potentials can bind multiple quasihole anyons to them, creating distinct bound states. As the chemical potential changes, the number of bound quasiholes increases. The paper suggests that this phenomenon occurs within a quantum Hall plateau, allowing experimental observation without deconfined particles. They also propose a method involving wavefunction studies and STM for detection.

Conclusion: The research provides a new way to study bound states of anyons using fractional quantum Hall systems. It highlights the importance of strong impurities for realizing anyon bound states and suggests realizing this in zero-field fractional Chern insulators, which opens new paths for both theoretical and experimental studies in quantum matter.

Abstract: Anyons are quasiparticles with fractional charge and statistics that arise in
strongly correlated two-dimensional systems such as the fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) effect and fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Interactions between anyons
can lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as
anyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall
states. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin
fractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong
attractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive
interaction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction
between the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers
of quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating
while remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes
bound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states
experimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton
spectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs
heterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the
recently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$
offer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.

Conclusion: 提供了实用且可靠的解决方案，对量子场论和计算物理学中的多种应用具有重要影响。

Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo
simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter
to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly
refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many
situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory,
and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the
algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises
as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To
remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation
method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the
infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an
exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to
the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is
straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results
establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem,
with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of
fundamental fermion simulations.

TL;DR: Abstract discusses the study of ErAl3's two polymorphs, α and β, focusing on their physical properties, including magnetic and electrical behaviors under various conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the properties and phase behavior of materials like ErAl3 is crucial for applications in various fields, possibly including materials science and condensed matter physics.

Method: The study involved growing single crystals, measuring magnetic properties like Néel temperatures and magnetic transitions, electrical resistivity, and magnetic field effects including resistivity changes and magnetoresistance.

Result: Both α- and β-ErAl3 exhibit antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures. β-phase shows a suppressed AFM transition with applied magnetic fields, while α-phase displays multiple magnetic transitions and strong anisotropy. α- has significant magnetoresistance and distinct behaviors at specific temperatures indicated by phase diagrams showing complex magnetic interactions influenced by competing interactions.

Conclusion: The research provides detailed insights into the phase transitions and coupled magnetic-electrical properties of α- and β- ErAl3, highlighting the impact of competing interactions in these polycrystalline systems with potential applications in technology.

Abstract: ErAl$_3$ can form in either a trigonal ($\alpha$) or cubic ($\beta$)
polymorph and this paper investigates the physical properties of these
polymorphs through characterizations of single crystals grown in an aluminum
flux. We demonstrate that polymorph selection can be achieved based on the
nominal composition of the crystal growth. Magnetic measurements confirm that
both $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ and $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ order antiferromagnetically at low
temperatures. $\beta$-ErAl$_3$ undergoes AFM ordering at a N\'eel temperature
T$_N$ = 5.1 K, and the transition is suppressed continually with applied field.
$\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ displays more complex behavior, with successive magnetic
transitions at T$_N$ = 5.7 K and T$_2$ = 4.6 K for zero field, where heat
capacity and dilatometry measurements evidence that these transitions are
second- and first-order, respectively. Under magnetic field, strong anisotropy
is revealed in $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, with several step-like metamagnetic
transitions observed below T$_2$ for H$\parallel$c. These transitions produce
sequential magnetization plateaus near one-half of the apparent saturation
magnetization. The electrical resistivity of $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$ is strongly
coupled to its magnetism. At $T$ = 2 K, we observe a positive magnetoresistance
reaching 60\%, with distinct anomalies at the metamagnetic transitions. The
results are summarized in $H$- $T$ phase diagrams that demonstrate complex
magnetic behavior for $\alpha$-ErAl$_3$, suggesting an important role of
competing interactions in this metallic system that possesses characteristics
of Ising physics.

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: This paper studies the ultrafast optical spectroscopy of CeBi and LaBi, revealing magneto-phononic coupling near their AFM ordering. CeBi shows a pump fluence threshold in the AFM state, suggesting a photoinduced non-thermal quenching, highlighting coherent phonons' role in heavy fermion systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between electronic and magnetic properties in topological semimetals like CeBi is crucial for advancing materials science. The study aims to explore this relationship using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, which can provide insights into dynamic magnetic ordering and phonon behavior.

Method: The researchers conducted ultrafast optical spectroscopy measurements on CeBi and its isostructural compound LaBi. They focused on analyzing the phonon dynamics and their response to external stimuli, such as temperature and pump fluence, near the antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures.

Result: The study found significant magneto-phononic coupling in CeBi near its AFM ordering temperatures, specifically at $T_{N1}$ ≈ 25 K and $T_{N2}$ ≈ 12 K. Additionally, CeBi exhibits a pump fluence threshold in the AFM state, suggesting a non-thermal quenching mechanism when the pump fluence exceeds a certain value.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that coherent phonons are highly sensitive probes of the electronic structure and magnetic order in heavy fermion systems. This suggests that ultrafast optical pulses could be a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling magnetic states in such materials, opening up new avenues for the study of emergent quantum phenomena and their applications.

Abstract: We report an ultrafast optical spectroscopy study on the coherent phonon
dynamics in the topological semimetal CeBi and its nonmagnetic isostructural
compound LaBi, revealing profound insights into their electronic and magnetic
interactions. Both materials exhibit prominent $A_{1g}$ longitudinal optical
phonons with characteristic anharmonic temperature dependencies. However, in
CeBi, the $A_{1g}$ phonon frequency and amplitude show clear anomalies near its
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering temperatures ($T_{N1}$ $\simeq$ 25 K and
$T_{N2}$ $\simeq$ 12 K), which unequivocally demonstrate strong
magneto-phononic coupling. Crucially, in the AFM state at 4 K, CeBi exhibits a
pump fluence threshold of $F_C$ $\approx$ 44 $\mu$J/cm$^2$, above which the
rate of phonon softening accelerates and the amplitude increases sharply. This
unique threshold, absent in paramagnetic CeBi and LaBi, points to a
photoinduced, non-thermal quenching of the AFM order. Our findings establish
coherent phonons as highly sensitive probes of intertwined orders in heavy
fermion systems, highlighting the transformative potential of ultrafast pulses
in dynamically controlling magnetic states in correlated electron materials and
paving the way for the manipulation of emergent quantum phases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the magnetic and structural properties of tr-Cr₁+δTe₂ is crucial as this material exhibits unique magnetic states and topological effects, making it a promising candidate in spintronic devices.

Method: The study uses a combination of x-ray diffraction, magnetization measurements, temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and neutron diffraction to analyze the material.

Result: The material undergoes two magnetic transitions, from FM to AFM at 197 K, then to PM at 211 K. Spin chirality contributes to the topological Hall effect, supported by neutron diffraction and magnetic ordering data.

Conclusion: The research advances our understanding of tr-Cr₁+δTe₂'s magnetic behavior and the role of spin chirality, providing insights into its potential applications in topological devices.

Abstract: Trigonal tr-Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_{2}$ is a well-known ferromagnetic material
that has recently drawn much attention due to the discovery of zero-field
skyrmion state, unusual anomalous Hall effect, topological Hall effect, and
topological Nernst effect. This quasi-van der Waals (vdW) layered material with
intercalated Cr atoms possesses many peculiar features that depend on the
amount of Cr intercalation, although the microscopic magnetic ground state is
still elusive. We reveal the structural and magnetic properties of
tr-Cr$_{1.22}$Te$_{2}$ by low-temperature x-ray diffraction, magnetization,
temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and single-crystal neutron
diffraction studies. Magnetization measurements under small applied magnetic
field indicate two successive magnetic transitions, one from a ferromagnetic
(FM) state to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state (T$_\mathrm{C}=197$ K), and
second from AFM to a paramagnetic state (T$_\mathrm{N}=211$ K). The FM
transition is sharp with a strong presence of magnetoelastic coupling, but is
not accompanied by any structural phase transition. The magnetic structure
obtained from zero-field single crystal neutron diffraction reveals that the
Cr1 and Cr2 moments are ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis, while the
Cr3 and intercalated Cr4 atoms induce an AFM component in the ab-plane leading
to an umbrella-like spin structure which possesses a finite spin chirality. The
presence of a finite spin chirality is responsible for the observation of the
topological Hall effect (THE).

Method: exact diagonalization calculations, dice lattice model, weak spin-orbit coupling

Result: Chern numbers C=2,6; many-body ground state with C numbers; well-defined gaps achieved

Conclusion: New phase diagram with competing orders; tunable properties for potential applications; Needs experimental verification to confirm the models predictions and to better understand the exact phase diagram.

Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect has been widely explored in both ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic systems. Here, we propose an interaction-driven
paramagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect emerging in the Fermion-Hubbard
model on a dice lattice with weak spin-orbit coupling. Based on exact
diagonalization calculations, the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the ground
state is evidenced by nonuniform loop currents between nearest-neighbor sites.
The many-body ground state possesses a Chern number of $\mathcal{C}=2$ or $6$,
and strong correlation effects in the half-filled flat bands lead to a
well-defined first excitation gap and a clear insulating gap, ensuring the
robustness against thermal fluctuations and external perturbations. The
interplay between spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard interaction allows tunability
of various magnetic ground states, generating a rich phase diagram with
competing ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic orders.

Abstract: We study the ground state phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model in a
half-filled 5/7 skewed ladder, which is topologically equivalent to a \{112\}
grain boundary in graphene and related systems. Using the mean-field method, we
identify various electronic and magnetic phases in the U-V plane, by
calculating the site charge and spin densities. The electronic phases include
partially charge-ordered metal or insulator, and fully charge-ordered
insulator. The different magnetic phases of the model are non-magnet, spin
density wave, spin split compensated ferrimagnet or partial antiferromagnet.
Analysis of the electronic band structure reveals that the partially
charge-ordered compensated ferrimagnetic phase exhibits spin polarisation,
which can be quite interesting for spintronics applications. We also compute
the polarisation as a function of $U$ using the Berry phase formalism and show
that the system exhibits multiferroicity with coexisting compensated
ferrimagnetic spin order alongside electronic polarisations.

Abstract: The electronic structure of the lightly hole-doped triangular-lattice moir\'e
Hubbard model is studied within cluster perturbation theory (CPT) using 13-site
clusters for a fixed doping concentration $p=1/13$ varying the Coulomb
parameter $U$ and the hopping phase parameter $\phi$ related to the
spin-orbital interaction. We have also developed a rather simple generalized
mean-field approximation (GMFA) containing the amplitude of the spin
correlations as a free parameter to fit the CPT data.The evolution of the Fermi
surface and the pseudogap with the parameters $\phi$ and $U$ is explained from
the viewpoint of the short-range magnetic order. The geometric frustration and
the additional model parameter related to the spin-orbital interaction result
in a more rich physics of the pseudogap state compared to the case of a more
conventional square lattice.

Abstract: The chiral magnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ hosts a rich and
anisotropic magnetic phase diagram that includes helical, conical,
field-polarized, tilted conical, and skyrmion lattice phases. Using resonant
elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), we uncover a new spiral state confined to the
surface of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. This surface-confined spiral state (SSS) displays a
real-space pitch of $\sim$120 nm, which remarkably is twice the length of the
incommensurate structures observed to-date in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The SSS phase
emerges at temperatures below 30~K when the magnetic field is applied near the
$\langle110\rangle$ crystallographic axis. Its surface localization is
demonstrated through a combination of REXS in reflection and transmission
geometries, with complementary small-angle neutron scattering measurements
suggesting its absence from the bulk. We attribute the stabilization of the SSS
to competing anisotropic interactions at the crystal surface. The discovery of
a robust, surface-confined spiral paves the way for engineering
energy-efficient, nanoscale spin-texture platforms for next-generation devices.

TL;DR: Fe³+ chains show robust antiferromagnetic coupling and an orbital-selective Mott phase, but lack pairing tendencies, unlike Fe²+ ladders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding electronic properties of iron-based systems is crucial, particularly for discerning between chains and ladders.

Method: First-principles and DMRG methods were employed for analysis.

Result: Orbital-selective Mott phase exists without pairing, antiferromagnetic order is present, distinguishing Fe³+ chains from ladders.

Conclusion: Fe³+ chains lack superconductivity, supporting earlier findings on ladders. Similarities and differences between Fe³+ chains and Fe²+ ladders clarified.

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the study of quasi-one-dimensional iron
systems with Fe$^{2+}$, we comprehensively study the Fe$^{3+}$ chalcogenide
chain system. Based on first-principles calculations, the Fe$^{3+}$ chain has a
similar electronic structure as discussed before in the iron 2+ chain, due to
similar Fe$X_4$ ($X$ = S or Se) tetrahedron chain geometry. Furthermore, a
three-orbital electronic Hubbard model for this chain was constructed by using
the density matrix renormalization group method. A robust antiferromagnetic
coupling was unveiled in the chain direction. In addition, in the intermediate
electronic correlation $U/W$ region, we found an interesting orbital-selective
Mott phase with the coexistence of localized and itinerant electrons ($U$ is
the on-site Hubbard repulsion, while $W$ is the electronic bandwidth).
Furthermore, we do not observe any obvious pairing tendency in the Fe$^{3+}$
chain in the electronic correlation $U/W$ region, where superconducting pairing
tendencies were reported before in iron ladders. This suggests that
superconductivity is unlikely to emerge in the Fe$^{3+}$ systems. Our results
establish with clarity the similarities and differences between Fe$^{2+}$and
Fe$^{3+}$ iron chains, as well as iron ladders.

Abstract: The microscopic origin of ferromagnetism in correlated materials remains
heavily debated, particularly for the competing mechanisms governing insulating
versus metallic phases. In this work, we theoretically study the electronic
structure evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and provide a consistent
explanation to three unique features of this system, i.e. the semiconducting
ferromagnetism at low pressure, the metallic ferromagnetism at high pressure,
and the enhanced Curie temperature in the metallic phase. We propose that it is
the reduced electronic correlation and enhanced $d$-$p$ hybridization that
universally drive the continuous evolution of CrGeTe$_{3}$ under pressure and
glue the three distinct experimental observations. Central to our discovery is
the dual role of metallicity -- it simultaneously establishes kinetically
driven exchange via $d$-$p$ hybridization and enables Stoner-type magnetic
instability, with the contribution also from the residual super-exchange. Our
analyses reveal that {\it intraband} excitations dominate the pressure-enhanced
$\omega_p^2$ and $T_c$ correlation. These findings establish $d$-$p$
hybridization and electronic correlation as the bridge between localized and
itinerant magnetism, at least, in CrGeTe$_{3}$.

### [222] [The electronic and transport properties in the Haldane-Hubbard with odd-parity altermagnetism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09906)
*Minghuan Zeng,Zheng Qin,Ling Qin,Shiping Feng,Dong-Hui Xu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical framework of odd-parity ALM using spin group methods and the Haldane-Hubbard model. Key findings include the role of broken nonmagnetic TRS supporting ALM, specific properties in optical conductivity, and distinct behaviors in hole-doped states. However, the abstract lacks a clear summary of the main results or implications, leading to a somewhat vague understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discovery of topological states with exotic properties is a hot topic in condensed matter physics. This paper focuses on a novel approach using sublattice currents to realize odd-parity ALM, which could open new avenues for topological materials and quantum devices.

Method: The authors employ spin group theory to analyze the conditions for ALM, then validate their findings using the Haldane-Hubbard model and the Kubo formula. The method involves both theoretical derivations and numerical simulations.

Result: They demonstrate that broken nonmagnetic TRS supports odd-parity ALM, and the Haldane-Hubbard model shows specific optical conductivity behaviors. Hole-doping leads to differing magnon and Hall conductivities in two ALM states, suggesting potential applications in topological quantum computing.

Conclusion: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for odd-parity ALM and suggests promising experimental setups. However, the practical implications and potential challenges need further investigation.

Abstract: The sublattice current is recently proposed as a feasible scheme to realize
the odd-parity altermagnetism(ALM) by breaking the nonmagnetic time reversal
symmetry. We first adopt the spin group method to analyze why the broken
nonmagnetic time reversal symmetry(TRS) is the sufficient condition for the
odd-parity ALM, and find that it is the symmetry $[\bar{C}_2||\bar{E}]$ that
allows the appearance of the odd-parity ALM where $\bar{C}_2$ represents a
$180^\circ$ rotation around an axis perpendicular to the spins combined with
the spin-space inversion, and $\bar{E}$ is the inversion in real space. As a
representative example with the presence of sublattice currents, the optical
conductivity of Haldane-Hubbard model is further studied using the Kubo
formula. It is shown that there is no spin-polarized electrical current in both
the longitudinal and traverse directions because of TRS in the odd-parity ALM,
and they display a significant peak in the vicinity of the single-particle
direct energy gap which reflects that both the longitudinal and traverse
optical conductivities are dominated by the quasiparticle excitations around
the Dirac points. We also study the hole doping dependence of the anomalous
Hall conductivity $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$ as well as the staggered magnetization
$M$, and find that they display opposite behaviors, i.e., $\sigma_{\rm Hall}$
in the ALM CI state is diminished monotonically from its initial value $C=2$ at
half-filling as the hole doping is increased, while in the ALMI state exhibits
a non-monotonous behavior.

Abstract: The intertwined electron correlation and topology give birth to emergent
quantum phenomena with fractionalized phases in condensed matter physics.
Recently, Chern insulators and fractional ones with C smaller than one have
been observed in twisted MoTe2 and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene-hBN moire
systems at zero magnetic fields, resembling the fractional quantum Hall phases
at high magnetic fields. Here, we target topological phases with high Chern
number C > 1 by designing a new moire system, i.e. twisted rhombohedral
trilayer-bilayer graphene. We observe Chern insulators with C = 3 at both v = 1
and v = 3. In particular, quantized anomalous Hall effect with C = -3 is
observed at v = 3 for device D2. Most importantly, by fractionally filling the
high Chern number flat band, we observe evidence of a fractional Chern
insulator with C = -3/2 developing from even-denominator fractional filling v =
5/2 at zero magnetic fields, which reaches a fractionally quantized Hall effect
with C = -3/2 (a quantization accuracy of 96%) at B = 4T. We have observed
another FCI with C = -6/5 at v = 12/5, supported by the Streda formula and
anomalous Hall effects induced time reversal symmetry breakings. In addition,
we observe Chern insulators with C = 1 and 2 at even-denominator fractional
filling v = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively, and strikingly, the signatures of
anomalous Hall crystal phases with high Chern numbers (C > 1) that develops
continuously from v = 1 to the even-denominator v = 3/2 at zero magnetic fields
in device D1 and D3. Our results demonstrate the tRTBG, which can be naturally
extended to other twisted graphene moire superlattices based on rhombohedral
graphene multilayers, as a novel platform for hosting unconventional high Chern
number correlated topology in the ultra-strong correlated regime that is beyond
the paradigm of the fractional phases with C < 1.

Abstract: We present results of an experimental study on single crystals of a 5d1
double perovskite Ba2CaReO6. Magnetization measurements reveal a weak splitting
between zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols below 12 K. At magnetic
fields above 1 T the splitting is absent and the magnetic susceptibility is
featureless. A detailed specific heat study in a wide temperature range and
comprising different heat pulses did not reveal any indication of a
thermodynamic phase transition. At low temperatures we do observe specific heat
deviating from a phonon background, leading to a total electronic entropy
release of ~Rln2. Resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction of characteristic
Bragg peaks indicates a significant presence of disorder, potentially related
to random tilts and rotations of rigid ReO6 octahedra.

Conclusion: 发现了新的自旋磁性体，且它们的非互惠性仅受微电场影响，不切换磁基底态。

Abstract: We show that an electric field can induce nonreciprocal spin wave dispersion
in magnetic insulators with negligible spin-orbit coupling. The electric field
controls the direction and magnitude of nonreciprocity through a nonlinear
magnetoelectric effect without switching the magnetic ground state. By deriving
spin space group symmetry constraints, we find only a subset of noncoplanar
magnets exhibits this property, and identify a few candidates. For the example
of hexagonal lattice tetrahedral antiferromagnet, our effective field theory
analysis and microscopic model calculation yield results that are fully
consistent with the symmetry analysis.

Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are typically marked by changes in quantum
correlations across various spatial scales within the system. A key challenge
lies in the fact that experimental probes are generally restricted to diagonal
quantities at the single-site scale, which are widely believed to be
insufficient for detecting phases with off-diagonal long-range order, such as
superconducting states. In a striking departure from conventional expectations,
we show that single-site diagonal descriptors -- charge and spin fluctuations,
occupation probabilities, and entanglement -- can capture the emergence of
off-diagonal long-range order in the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at
half-filling. These single-site quantities display clear critical signatures of
the superconducting transition, preceded by a continuous breaking of
particle-hole symmetry, consistent with a second-order phase transition. While
this symmetry breaking has a negligible effect on single-site descriptors, it
allows a direct connection between local fluctuations and nonlocal
correlations.

Abstract: The minimal model for infinite-layer nickelates remains under debate,
particularly regarding the hybridization between itinerant interstitial-$s$ and
the correlated Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as the interaction between
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other $3d$ orbitals. Additionally, how the doped holes in
La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ are distributed among different orbitals remain
unresolved. Motivated by recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) experiments, we theoretically study the electronic structure of
infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at various doping levels. We find that,
unlike the expectation from a rigid band shift, holes are equally distributed
to Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and interstitial-$s$ orbitals. The role of
interstitial-$s$ orbital is further confirmed from the renormalization of
Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, for which the coupling between interstitial-$s$ and
Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ exerts a non-negligible impact on the orbital-selective
renormalization observed in ARPES. We also discuss the implication of our
results to the single-band model, where the interstitial-$s$ orbital in the
normal state of La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ acts as charge donator enhancing the
correlation of Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ by increasing its concentration close to
half-filling.

*Zhao Zhang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: The paper explores the Hubbard model on specific lattices, using the RVB concept and BA method. Key findings include RVB ground states modified by geometry and use of BA for first quasi-1D application. More details needed for comprehensive understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Hubbard model is a fundamental framework in condensed matter physics, studying correlations in materials. This paper seems to push the boundaries of understanding its behavior on complex geometries, possibly relevant for high-temperature superconductivity or spin liquids.

Method: The authors use the resonant valence bond (RVB) theory and Bethe ansatz (BA) method. They examine Hubbard model on sawtooth and pyrochlore lattices under U→∞ and doping conditions. For the sawtooth, they employ BA to handle spinless or spin-polarized fermions and multiple holons. For pyrochlore stripe, they leverage RVB ground states modified by the lattice structure.

Result: The paper presents new understanding: RVB states exist on specific dilute doped lattices, modified by their geometry, and the kinetic energy of the charge sector is critical for their existence. BA method successfully solves the sawtooth chain, introducing multiple holons in the ground states. Additionally, they clarify the RVB framework for multi-orbital systems.

Conclusion: The study deepens our knowledge of Hubbard model ground states on complex lattices. It suggests potential for applying similar methodologies to other geometrically frustrated systems. Future research could follow up with numerical simulations and experiments on materials with such lattice structures. They set a foundation in strongly correlated systems, addressing key mechanisms in condensed matter physics.

Abstract: The Hubbard model at $U\to\infty$ has recently been shown to have resonant
valence bond (RVB) ground states on the corner-sharing sawtooth and pyrochlore
lattices in the dilute doping limit of a single vacancy. In an effort to
further generalize those results, I study how the ground state is modified when
not all corners are shared between two tetrahedra as in the quasi-1D lattices
of a pyrochlore stripe, and how to approach the problem in the case of finite
doping. Using a non-Abelian version of the flux inequality, the tetrahedron
chain is shown to have degenerate RVB-like ground states. The Bethe ansatz (BA)
is adapted to solve the sawtooth chain with spinless or spin-polarized fermions
and multiple holons, which is the first example of applying BA to a quasi-1D
lattice.

rich phase diagram with critical lines and multi-critical points. We work with
the model with certain $Z_2$ symmetries and identify the allowed symmetry
protected topological phases using the winding number as the topological
invariant. The model belongs to the CII-class of the $10-$fold classification
and allows for integer values of the winding number. We confirm that the system
also hosts localized zero energy Majorana edge modes, consistent with the
integer value of the winding number of the corresponding phase. We further
study scaling and universality behaviour of the various topological phase
transitions.
